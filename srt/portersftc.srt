00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,559
industry some Churches have a 5:00 cuz

something I don't know but

662
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,159
like cuz Catholics like to drink we love

663
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,360

664
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,279

[Applause]

679
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,960
if you've never been to a Catholic mass

680
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:17,440
it's about an hour

681
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,760
long sometimes you can get out in

682
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,079
45 there's this variable in the middle

683
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,399
called the

684
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:27,079
homy where the priest can just talk

685
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,399
about whatever he feels is relevant and

686
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,760
sometimes he's really succinct and gets

687
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,159
to the point and gets out you're out

688
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,119

691
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,240
back to whipping

692
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,800
post first half an hour of any Catholic

693
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,760
Mass is like anybody else's Church where

694
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,040
they talk to you they sing to you you

695
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,760
know touching

696
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,520
yourself Jesus doesn't love you when

697
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:02,320
you're touching yourself right I'm

698
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,839
paraphrasing but that's a gist of and

699
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,480
uh the second half an hour is like a

700
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:08,920
cooking show with

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,560
Jesus cuz they take crackers and turn

702
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,760
them into the body of Christ then they

703
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,800
take a $4 bottle of wine and turn it

704
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,320

joke cuz not everyone can laugh at it

843
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,160
and the people the groups that can't are

844
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,560
very divided like the younger kids can't

845
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,280
laugh at it cuz they'd settle for

846
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,200
that they be like yeah she's touching it

847
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,920

850
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,280
would just touch it it'll probably go

851
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,760

852
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:27,119
