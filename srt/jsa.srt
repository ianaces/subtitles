why you here why am I here cuz uh I

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,960
heard the Afghan women were

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,399
hot you know you see that little burka

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,600
thing it just gets me stiffer than the

9
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,600
gay sale at a Ricky Martin

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,239
concert you know the one modification I

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,239
would make on the burka you know they

12
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,840
have the ice slot here I would actually

13
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,039
move it down to

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,559
here my policy is no jokes left behind I

15
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,640
don't like to leave jokes that don't get

16
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,400
laughs I'll tell them until they get a

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
laugh if I have to jump into the

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
audience and start tickling some of

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,439
these guys that's what I'll

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,920
do it was funny because when I was nine

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,759
I used to get this big bag of green army

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
men from the 5 and 10 I would stand them

23
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,920
up and Rose and I'd stayed in front of

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,150
him and tell him jokes and pretend I was

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,369
Bob

[Music]

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,799
Hope just I'm kidding you're

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,840
not uh no I'm here for the troops really

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,079
you know uh I believe in what they're

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,079
doing and uh I really appreciate the

31
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,159
sacrifice and uh I thought it was the

32
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,840
least I could do as an American citizen

33
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
having them defend you know my way of

34
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,880
life you know I'm a comedian so I could

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,799
tell jokes so if I could offer my

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,719
services in some way then I felt uh that

37
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,719
uh compelled to do

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,320
it I live in Los Angeles

39
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,119
but I travel quite extensively chances

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,960
are if people speak English I've

41
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,479
probably worked there but one of my

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,959
favorite things I've ever done a

43
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,120
highlight of my career was actually to

44
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,520
go to Afghanistan and entertain the

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,560
troops truly one of my favorite things

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,800
I've done uh you know as a comedian you

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,640
know you know Bob Hope who was one of

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
our beloved Americans and also you know

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,440
one of the Pioneers he pioneered

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,760
Vaudeville he pioneered radio he

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,280
pioneered television and film as well as

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,920
these mediums developed but he was most

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,000
beloved to Americans because he would

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,080
travel to these War zones like in World

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,120
War II and Korea and Vietnam and

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,840
entertain the troops you know you don't

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,599
hear about too many entertainers doing

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,200
that as much anymore but I could see how

59
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,400
somebody like Bob Hope could get

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,640
addicted to it because it's it's such a

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,920
great feeling knowing that you're doing

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,080
something positive yeah for people that

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
are doing something very positive so

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
whether you agree with the war or not

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,920
you know those those men and women are

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,480
there under under the flag of our

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,319
country serving the country and you got

68
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,599
to respect them and appreciate them and

69
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,640
support them because at the end of the

70
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,360
day really what they're doing is

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,040
supporting you so you don't have to go

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,400
do those things

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:17,000
yeah it's one thing to say I support the

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,360
military and it's another thing to uh

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,640
step off the back of a ch47 alpha class

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,560
Shel helicopter and step into a war zone

77
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,560
to entertain these

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,920
guys more more than the guys up north

79
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,000
good by the way

80
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:39,080
yeah really that's uh that's sort of

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,360
more of an incentive Jesus it's 130 de

82
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,360
at

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,280
night

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,080
nice well we got the guitar and the OSI

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,079
agents picked us up and took us to the

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,360
lud Air Force Base we got there about

87
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,680
12:30 and then we went to the mesal we

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,640
got something to eat and we met Colonel

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
parar who would later take us around the

90
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,159
base and show us to our rooms which were

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,239
these giant mobile homes with air

92
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,319
conditioners in

93
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,280
them now this is where we're supposed to

94
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,680
go in case of a rocket

95
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,519
attack which is in here nice the

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,519
sandbags on the

97
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,880
top that's when you know you're doing a

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,959
good comedy gig when there's a bunker

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,440
where you got to where you got to run in

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,440

103
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,880
bunkers notice all the air conditioners

104
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,360
because what you say Dave it's uh I

105
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,240
would guess it's close to 100 and it's

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,960

338
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,559
these guys because they have on these 40

339
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,240

spectacular I didn't hear any complaints

344
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,520
these guys believed in what they were

345
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,280
doing they were all about the mission

346
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,240
first and these people really understood

347
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,240
that you you have to watch out for your

348
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,840

349
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,760

thanks

555
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,279
about and I remember walking through

556
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,880
there with Drew and people would just

557
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,399
pop their head out of like cubicles or

558
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,039
offices and the minute they saw them

559
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,960
just they'd light up and they'd smile

560
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,399
and that was that's what it was about

561
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,799
you know them just smiling for at least

562
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,760
a few minutes even if they just got to

563
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:49,640
meet him if they couldn't go to a show

564
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,799
and that guy led by example too because

565
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,919
when you see a guy that's as big as he

566
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,399
is taking pictures with people while

567
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,760
he's eating then you you see that and

568
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:00,760
you go man this is a huge star and he's

569
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,320
