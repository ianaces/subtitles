right out of the ceiling which then

37
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,560
automatically caused the fire department

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,879
the building had to be evacuated and 44

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,239

little frog legs apart

101
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600

102
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,759
get locked up for licking a frog you

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,560
know I I just assume the worst when you

104
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
hear a story like

105
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,520
that so it turns out these frogs

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
actually perspire they secrete a

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,440
substance on his back is classified as

108
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,600
an endo hallucinogenic it's a class a

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,560
narcotic it's a very powerful toxin it's

110
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,840
part of the frog's defense mechanism

111
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,479
like if another animal tried to eat the

112
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Frog there's frog consecrates this

113
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,800
hallucinogenic substance that way when

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,560
the animal grabs in its mouth and starts

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,240
tripping and drops the Frog and sees

116
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,240
like 14 different frogs and doesn't know

117
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,880
which one to go after but that's how the

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,520

day and watch the waiters walk by with

206
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
the different ways that they can be

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,279

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,560
fish faces just cuz they don't have

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,600
barbecue joint that has a petting zoo in

213
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,079
the middle of it that's all I'm saying

214
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm just trying to eat some fish and the

215
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:15,000

Larry

222
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Larry L

223
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm crying for you li except nobody

224
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,079
knows I'm crying cuz I'm in

225
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,519
water don't you see the cruel irony of

226
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:45,120
it all where the animal rights people on

227
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,600
something like that huh you know I guess

228
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,560
if you don't have fur you're out of luck

229
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,079
cuz that's what they don't want you

230
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,920
wearing fur don't wear fur don't wear I

231
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,240
don't care when you wear leather really

232
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,200
just fur I'm guessing that's cuz it's

233
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,120
much easier to harass a woman than it is

234
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,920
a biker

235
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,240
that would be my guess otherwise why

236
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,839
don't you went down to the biker bar and

237
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,519
throw red paint on warlocks colors and

238
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,640
watch your teeth become an endangered

239
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,079
species let's see how committed you are

240
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,800

241
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,519

the exit door how fast do I have to run

339
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,320
before Little Johnny picks me up and

340
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,320
pumps off a couple shots in my direction

341
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,639
