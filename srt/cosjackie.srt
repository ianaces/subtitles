00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,439
is Betty Walker my guest is Jackie C

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,800
hello I enjoy the small we think yeah

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,040
because Cliff nesteroff who wrote a book

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,760
that I haven't read about the history of

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,120
Comedy um did you read it no yeah there

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,360
you go I need to get it it's the way to

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,120
go it's the way to go I say uh cuz uh we

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,320
hear about it and it'll be fine

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,879
absolutely we're living in the moment I

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,199
he doesn't need my help Mel Brooks loved

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,000
it like he got you know he got all the

17
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,440
praise of the good people right yeah so

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,480
it's probably a very good book the thing

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,280
is is people whenever anybody writes a

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,440
book that's supposedly like the history

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,879
of Comedy you're

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,600
like how about the of some comedy right

23
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,760
and that's inevitable and it's

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,000
inevitable and it's it's there's no

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,200
there's no way to to make it it be

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,400
everything to everybody so um I wanted

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,119
it to have more than one line about

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,280
Carol brunett but that's me you know uh

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,640
so who knows and so I picked uh an album

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,600
off of your list yes because I am Jackie

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,240
K and I never listened to stand-up

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,079
comedy um never did as a child that's

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
been established the only album I ever

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,640
bought we did it last time yes Lenny

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Bruce yeah that was a and that was a fun

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,159
album to talk about too um yeah cuz it

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,840
was his best album we went with in my

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,079
opinion cuz I I bought a bunch of other

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,399
ones and threw them away okay I just

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,399
kept the one and then when I got rid of

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,479
my record player I got rid of that album

42
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,439
as well for the for the love of God I'm

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,079

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,200
premise that I don't approve of you

69
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,360
don't approve I do not approve of half

70
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,400

um just tell The Joke Man uh I

76
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,640
don't I don't I don't mean to get all

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,080
lety Bruce in your head in your face but

78
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,239
uh Mor Saul I he brought the newspaper

79
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,680
up sure guess what you why don't you

80
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,159
read the newspaper write some jokes

81
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,560
about it leave the newspaper back at

82
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,560
your table

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,519
so your thought is Betty Betty Betty's

84
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,200
literally phoning it in oh my gosh Betty

85
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,760
and Bob both phoning it in but and this

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,120
thing like literally literally or I

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,040
don't I've never use that word correctly

88
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,400
hi

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,640
guys are you listening uh so this is

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,920
actually a very funny album but it's

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,640
it's kind of

92
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,159
um it's sticky and it very much

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,319
some of it doesn't it doesn't you know

94
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,360
what I was going to say it doesn't hold

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,239
up but it actually does for exactly what

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,519
it is it's good for exactly what it is

97
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,920
yeah but being like one note is kind of

98
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,640
difficult for you is that the thing yeah

99
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,560
it's 40 minutes of one note and this

100
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,440
woman Betty Walker if she is portraying

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,199
herself you're like you're a mess lady

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,360
and but I did watch Rod Sterling had a

103
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,919
um uh a game show you sent this to me I

104
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,160
had no idea that exist uhhuh and then he

105
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,000
redid it with a well somebody else redid

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,520
it as a host in um in 74 okay and she

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,280
worked on both of them and it looked

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
like a golden opportunity to probably

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,880
make 250 cash right right right hardcore

110
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,400
uh sort of like the at midnight of of

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,000
our current uh Administration you know

112
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,160
it's a great way to make a grand and uh

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
and the youth are watching it yep so

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,880
maybe it'll drive some people to a show

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,759
sure and and she's a comic so

116
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,360
but I think she mostly like I think it

117
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,320
was sort of like Charles Nelson Riley in

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,960
the end where she was just doing that

119
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,840
and then maybe some standup but not like

120
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,800
she wasn't really acting she only acted

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,160
I think in the 50s a little bit in the

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
interesting see that's interesting to me

123
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,919
this is yeah clearly honestly if we'

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,840
have looked at the cover I guess we

125
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,319
probably could have guessed 69 pretty

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,400
easily it looks pretty groovy I mean

127
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,039
maybe yeah

128
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,280
maybe she's got a Paisley shirt on God I

129
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,199
want it to be 59 yeah I understand

130
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,520
believe me I just it's not that I don't

131
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,560
like Bob new but how great would it be

132
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,039
if we had a huge reveal mhm this came

133
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,560
out two years before nope nope it did

134
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,639
not well Shelley burman's convinced that

135
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,400
Bob newart stole it or was convinced at

136
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,039
one point that he stole his act but then

137
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,880
again uh what's his name uh George

138
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,360
Jessel was doing that act in the 20s and

139
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,840
30s so but who's to say there wasn't a

140
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,880
woman doing it it would be interesting

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,039
to know if there are other women who did

142
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,440
the phone bit how great would it be if

143
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
someone was doing a telegraph thing in

144
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,520
the 1860s

145
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,080
seal hello seal yeah no I'm just calling

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,280
to tell you that can I borrow some money

147
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,720
anyway and no is it okay and uh so and

148
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,440
some of the tropes are are just you know

149
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,039
she's essentially a housewife right yeah

150
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,720
and that's she's portraying a housewife

151
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:27,479
whose husband controls all the money and

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,360
she is hiding debt she's hiding uh

153
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,840
shitty uh life choices she doesn't have

154
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,080
any money yeah and so Mr tupperman uh

155
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,319
who's a first name I've forgotten yeah

156
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,479
me too and maybe Howard uh but whatever

157
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:43,000
her husband um who I think at one point

158
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,160
she refers to as Mr tupperman does feels

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,160
romantic and

160
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:54,120
um but he's um he's he's all the things

161
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,400
that it's sort of a I mean it's a little

162
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,479
it's it's a little hacky but it's only

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,000
hacky because it been done sure it's

164
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,000
been done so much since then mhm and it

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,879
wasn't they were some of some of the

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,800
lines were actually quite funny and

167
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,160
um I wish I would have taken notes yeah

168
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,759
no I wish I'd done the same thing but I

169
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,199
I had the same exact feeling although it

170
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,680
feels like 1969 feels like the last time

171
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,080
you could have done it and I don't know

172
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,879
why she would still be you know like

173
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,280
even The Brady Bunch was like was out of

174
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,960
step with what Middle America was and

175
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,319
this just seems so already dat women's

176
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,280
Li yeah yeah it feels very dated

177
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,120
remember um women couldn't have their

178
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,520
own credit cards until

179
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,520
74 and so I mean there was like and I

180
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,639
read this book I read this amazing weird

181
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,159
book about romance novels because I

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,639
inadvertently admitted during a uh

183
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:52,159
probably I I think my last album hor

184
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:56,080
Crux that I read romance novels and

185
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:58,000
since then I you um you're never alone

186
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,879
you guys so people are constantly

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,879

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,759
can't buy other people's porn so stop

189
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
handing me romance weird I've even

190
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,960
gotten Maria banford to stop buying them

191
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,479
cuz she'll go to like a Walgreens or

192
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,879
something and she's like what about this

193
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,479
one look at his chest and you're like

194
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,800
stop buying them for me and um but the

195
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,159
um but I did get this non-fiction book

196
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,840
called

197
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,240
um uh dangerous books for girls MH and

198
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,159
it was about the history of romance

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,479
novels and it was that's interesting

200
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,240
lightly researched it felt a little bit

201
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,200
like a romance novel in the fact that it

202
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,440
was a lightly historical romance the

203
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,519
history pretty light yeah

204
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,320
um by Maya Rodell rodale whatever her

205
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,880
name is anyway but one of the things she

206
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,800
pointed out was that the reason romance

207
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,440
novels were sold in grocery stores is

208
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,800
because women could buy them using the

209
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,360
grocery budget interesting and so their

210
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,120
fellas their husbands didn't know they

211
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,000
were like oh there's an extra two three

212
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,440
bucks on the grocery list well it's a

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,120
romance novel that's fascinating yeah it

214
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,640
was kind of fascinating holy [ __ ] the

215
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,720
just a subterfuge to go through just to

216
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,360
feel human to get a book written by a

217
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,480
woman for a women for women about women

218
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
and even if it's some weird rape fantasy

219
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,000
where you're like any fantasy that makes

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,120
me not make meatloaf on a Wednesday

221
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,640
night you know and because I remember

222
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,800
when I first started reading them some

223
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,519
of them were really old at the library

224
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,600
and it was just one horrible he you know

225
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,279
Luke and Laura from General Hospital

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,000
where he rapes her and she falls in love

227
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,000
with them and then you're like that

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,600
seems wildly unlikely yep and uh but you

229
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,279
do whatever you got to do lady you need

230
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,920
to get laid uh you need to check out

231
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,800
okay it's on between you and your God oh

232
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,640
my God the fact that that art existed I

233
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,320
think the assumption is that we're on a

234
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,560
weird track right now but like the

235
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,560
assumption is always that those these

236
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,160
power fantasies are more for men but the

237
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,079
fact that they were made for women and

238
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,320
that it and they sold like hoty

239
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,640
yeah it's so but you you again if you

240
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,880
have no other choices what are you going

241
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,000
to right right it was it was sort of the

242
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,160
definition of those power fantasies were

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,360
the power fantasies and so women are

244
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,560
like all right well that's the fantasy

245
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,720
yeah yeah maybe in the end he falls for

246
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,120
her anyway right it's not that he wants

247
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,760
to just beat her up and rape her he also

248
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,760
he wants to beat her up and rape her but

249
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,079
then get this he also wants to shower

250
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,000
her with diamonds and take her out to

251
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:31,399
dinner weird you guys totally weird I

252
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,160
know makes you want to weep but um so

253
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,560
this I mean so this lady in 69 yeah I

254
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,560
think and plus she was remember I think

255
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,200
she was probably 35 years old in 1974 MH

256
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:49,360
so she wasn't like a 16-year-old in 1969

257
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:52,040
sure bringing it right um but I will say

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,040
but it's okay so perfect couple mhm do

259
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,200
you remember that one uh if you remind

260
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,760
me what it is I'm sure I will I can't I

261
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,880
can't remind you Warren's flu I remember

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,760
they really really run in together the

263
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,720

264
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,120

because it was a the call from the bank

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,880
mhm and I think the horse thing was at

269
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,800
the end of the of the bank thing cuz she

270
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,880

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,839

00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,600
years by the way so um

305
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,920
like the ones that yeah guess who's

306
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,639
getting married I Warren's flu was was

307
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,560
one I did not like because it was just

308
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,079
about how he had the flu and how he

309
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,839
didn't she didn't like him right and it

310
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:20,959
was irritating so um like I

311
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:25,040
like I I uh if I remember correctly 4:00

312
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:29,399
in the morning was pretty good MH

313
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,279
um yeah I don't know they were um

314
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:37,320
the what there was social commentary in

315
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:41,600
it obviously but it was very much

316
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,000
um it was it was I mean the the things

317
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,760
that stuck with me is that she didn't

318
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,279
have her own money and she had to hide

319
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,639
this money business and uh she wasn't

320
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,320
very good at it and then what there was

321
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,959
another

322
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,320
one it

323
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,160
was it's not helpful this is not helpful

324
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,279
at all wish I had listened to it right

325
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,040
but unfortunately I listened to it a

326
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,320
couple of days ago yeah yeah yeah no but

327
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,560
I mean that's that's enough that it

328
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,000
stood out to me is it do you think it's

329
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,639
better that there seems to be a clearly

330
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,279
it's not a romantic relationship left at

331
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,720
all between her and her husband is it is

332
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,560
is it funnier that that's like super

333
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,839
true or would it been have been more of

334
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,160
a a better album to you if if they there

335
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,920
was a little hint of like sweet old

336
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,320
American love between them would have

337
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,480
been awesome if if this album had turned

338
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,800
into how much she and and I've talked

339
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,040
about this a couple of times on

340
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,680
different podcasts about how it's so

341
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:45,240
much work to write negative comedy and

342
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,519
it can be done very well obviously right

343
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,880
um there's some seriously grumpy Comics

344
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:54,160
who are super broken that write some

345
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,560
hilarious comedy but for me I like the

346
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,079
idea of being happy and doing the work

347
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,720
to write jokes about that happiness

348
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,240
that's work too yeah but then get this

349
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,000
if you're negative you live this

350
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,759
horrible negative life you write these

351
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,440
great jokes about your horrible negative

352
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,040
life and then you relive it every time

353
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,920
you tell that damn joke I would rather

354
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,920
be happy do the hard work of writing

355
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,040
jokes about being happy and then get to

356
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,240
relive that happiness every time I do

357
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,680
that joke it's just as much work in my

358
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,560
opinion but I get to be happy yeah so um

359
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,759
that would have been amazing if Betty

360
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,079
Walker um but I I don't know that there

361
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,759

362
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,360
about how much they love their husbands

363
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,880
and wife of course of course did Phyllis

364
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,120
Diller I remember Fang have you heard

365
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,880
any of the Fang jokes yes I have and

366
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,399
they were all pretty grumpy right yeah

367
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,279
yeah yeah yeah actually there's a

368
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,399
project online it's I think it's still

369
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,160
going through the Smithsonian yeah

370
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,759
through Smithsonian her joke files being

371
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,199
transcribed and I went through and I

372
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,480
transcribed a few of them and you can

373
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,319
correct other people's transcriptions

374
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,000
like just as [ __ ] shitload Wikipedia

375
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:00,680
kind of thing basically basically but

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,680
like basically you pull up a scan of a

377
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,360
card with one of her jokes on it you

378
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,000
type on the type in the date type the

379
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,639
subject matter and then you know

380
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,920
whatever the shitty joke was and I say

381
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,680
shitty just like you know they're just

382
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,880
dumb they're great though Phil s's

383
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,199
fantastic but like just a dumb joke that

384
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,160
it was it's so weird when people keep it

385
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,440
like that you know like Joan Rivers had

386
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:25,680
those filing cabins yeah and

387
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,560
um D fan used to talk about uh but uh

388
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,360
files that he had online and Eliza

389
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:35,680
slesinger has some sort of of uh Excel

390
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,360
document and um I have Stacks and stacks

391
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,000
of of notebooks sure I've kept all my

392
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,199
notebooks yeah for why we don't know I

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,519
think Mark Maron said it best when he

394
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,600
said I picture when I'm dead everyone

395
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,040
just going oh my god let's read all this

396
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,759
and nobody's going to read it they're

397
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,720
just they're going to light it on fire

398
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,120
well yeah yeah that's exactly right yeah

399
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,199
yeah and so I remember the first time I

400
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,800
ever saw Maria throw bford friend of

401
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,360
mine right so we've been doing stand up

402
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,520
together since '92 993 and um the first

403
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,319
time I ever saw her throw a notebook out

404
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,959
was probably seven or eight years ago

405
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,520
and I was like wait what are you doing

406
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,839
she said I'm done with the notebook I'm

407
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,959
throwing it away and I was

408
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,000
like oh my I I could keep them and sell

409
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,640
them on eBay and she was like watch this

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,039
and she threw it away in front of me and

411
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,679
I was like okay your notebook you get to

412
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,760
do whatever you want that's going to

413
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,160
that is going to be a piece of legend

414
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,880
that is going to be one of those things

415
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,559
that people are not going to believe in

416
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,640
30 years uh because yeah it's it's it's

417
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,160
yeah that's I I I it's disappointing cuz

418
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,960
you're like cuz I want to see the

419
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,200
Doodles I want to see the weird like

420
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,840
like magazine articles she cuz she is

421
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,559
always counting Out magazine articles

422
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,320
and gluing them into her notebook you're

423
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,520
like what's happening in this notebook

424
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,039
because my notebook is all just it's

425
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,080
just writing just me scribbling so wow

426
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,600
well at the end of The Comedy is so

427
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,120
different now from let's take let's take

428
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,919
you and then let's take Phyllis Diller

429
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,000
Phyllis Diller needed a stack cuz I

430
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,520
think I I'm assuming it's just like oh

431
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,679
maybe there's some [ __ ] I can refer to

432
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,280
go pull all the stuff I got about

433
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,159
weddings I got to go do a thing right

434
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,640
right I mean what if you so she's doing

435
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,640
she's doing events right and she's

436
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
separated them in these card cataloges

437
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,480
by topic right is that what's happening

438
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,720
they are they're they're almost

439
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,159
exclusively Topic at Le they're they're

440
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,960
by date and then I assume they're by

441
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,400
topic first but yeah like it's like

442
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,440
celebrities is the topic and then

443
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,559
celebrities uh this obscure celebrity

444
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,960
whose name I've never [ __ ] heard and

445
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,360
I typed up 10 jokes about this person uh

446
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,120
so it's it's so weird to but I mean have

447
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,559
you done corporate gigs in there I've

448
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,320
done some corporates and I'm not

449
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,080
particularly good at them mostly because

450
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,080
I don't like them yeah I bet um

451
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,840
they're I mean it's

452
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,039
it's the best people who do corporates

453
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,960
write to the corporation sure they write

454
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:02,159
to the business uh they write jokes to

455
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,720
to that topic mhm um the boss the the

456
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,240
the work

457
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,440
MH the city that they're in you know and

458
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,440
I do none of that I'm like do you want

459
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,559
to see my ACT okay I will come and

460
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,840
perform it for you wow and then you will

461
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,120
pay me and that is something that is not

462
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,520
a

463
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,120
corporate I'm I'm shocked that anybody

464
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,679
would let you do I like I didn't know

465
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,799
that that it ever went that way I always

466
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,080
assumed it had to be customized to the

467
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,320
oh no no no it's mostly yeah it's mostly

468
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,120
just normal they just want to

469
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,960
fascinating okay and the only the only

470
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,240
thing like when I do corporates you know

471
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,320
they'll say a couple of things about

472
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,960
corporates is uh first of all um you

473
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,280
should always get paid depending on the

474
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,919
amount of credits you have a buck per

475
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,679
person attending mhm okay and if you

476
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,799
have credits five bucks per person

477
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,000
attending okay and if it's 200 people uh

478
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:57,080
you should get a lot of money yeah and

479
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,480
um so like there was a guy uh several

480
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,720
years ago who and ended up doing like

481
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,840
the the LA County Sheriff's luncheon MH

482
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,919
that they hired but didn't pay and then

483
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,880
he ended up doing some jokes that had

484
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:15,120
the n-word in them and swearing a lot

485
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,720
and it was a luncheon for cops and uh

486
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
there was a big expose about it and they

487
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,520
were like look at this horrible thing

488
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,200
that happened well was because they

489
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,400
didn't pay them yeah if you're paying a

490
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,799
comic in lunch they're going to do their

491
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:30,039
set for themselves of course but if you

492
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:32,520
pay me $3,000 uhhuh I my brain's

493
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,159
attached to my mouth of course I won't

494
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,760
and all you got to do is tell me don't

495
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,440
swear yep try not to do your weird

496
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,200
abortion chunk I don't have a weird

497
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,960
abortion chunk but if I did um you could

498
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,520
tell me not to do it cuz you were paying

499
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,080
me enough money to tell me what to do

500
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,360
and what not to do CU standup comedy is

501
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,919
so I mean in general it's super Loosey

502
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,600
Goosey you do whatever you want right

503
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,440
you write the jokes that you write and

504
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,200
you tell the jokes that you want to tell

505
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,600
right and when it when it comes to a

506
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,039
corporate or um

507
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,960
colleges they because they supposedly

508
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:08,799
pay better MH they get to tell you what

509
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,440
you what you can and cannot do makes

510
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,600
sense and some clubs are actually like

511
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,279
that too where you'll walk in and

512
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,440
they're like hey um keep it together and

513
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,640
uh and you're like fair enough you've

514
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,120
hired me this is the this is the club I

515
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,400
want to work so and and yeah I mean the

516
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,080
weirdest thing I I I auditioned for a

517
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,840
cruise ship one time and they didn't

518
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,360
like my outfit and he's like hey I'm a

519
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,360
dressy Bessie I can take this outfit off

520
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,080
put on whatever outfit you want right

521
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,200
did you want me to work your cruise they

522
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,159
did not it turns out cuz they didn't get

523
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
back to me about that I didn't even say

524
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,960
I was a dressy Bessie I tried to keep it

525
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,720
polite I said well obviously I can wear

526
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,799
whatever you want me to wear you me to

527
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,159
wear a ball gown and do standup comedy

528
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,240
and that's that's interesting because

529
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,320
she is wearing I think a dress in this

530
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,240
thing is yeah kind of it certainly looks

531
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,320
yeah it's a [ __ ] Paisley Crazy Pink

532
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,400
PA number that is uh yeah that is a

533
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,559
polyester nightmare which is not my

534
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,799
phrase I don't remember where I got it

535
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:11,080
from but she yeah it's a little scary

536
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:13,520
but she could something like this it

537

Comedy sure sure grumpy Christian Comedy

560
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,760
I mean there's different ways of because

561
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,840
there are plenty of comics who are

562
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,159
Christians who are not they don't have

563
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,720
mean jesuses right they're just they're

564
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,679
just telling jokes and uh I I knew a guy

565
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,600
who was like he got asked to do this

566
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,840
Christian comedy thing and he was like

567
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,720
yeah I'm a Christian but I don't think I

568
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,960
can do your thing because your thing is

569
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,640
weird he's like I I don't know what kind

570
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,320
of Christian you need me to be right

571
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,640
right right and he's like I'm just a

572
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,880
normal hey I hope it all works out for

573
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,480
you kind of Christian you know and

574
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,120
um I don't care about other people's

575
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,919
religion I just I just I just want to do

576
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,240
my thing and uh it's very American old

577
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,440
school American and but I so I think

578
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:02,120
that there are probably

579
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,039
people I know that there are like what

580
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,559
do you think maybe the promisekeepers

581
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:09,039
maybe those guys would love a housewife

582
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,000
comedian yeah who would just talk about

583
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,480
real stereotypical housewifey kind of

584
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,520
stuff I guess so yeah I get I mean I I

585
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,840
mean I like that there's I like her

586
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,559
attitude a lot I like her I mean there

587
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,919
there's a modern version of this this is

588
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,279
a more positive spinoff there's a modern

589
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,840
version of

590
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,720
this that now granted I have not seen

591
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,799
this woman's the woman I'm about to say

592
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:34,399
her long set in probably seven or eight

593
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:37,360
years but Debbie Gutierrez is uh Latino

594
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:39,799
mommy comedy MH is essentially what she

595
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,840
called it she says yeah I pretty much do

596
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:44,039
Latino mommy comedy okay and Latino

597
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,640
mommy comedy is sort of this talking

598
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:49,279
about her kids talking about her husband

599
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,919
talking about uh her friends uh Debbie

600
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,919
Gutierrez just tells the joke she's not

601
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,679
on the phone which I I I don't know that

602
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,679
the phone thing would ever go you see

603
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,720
that's what I'm wondering that was I

604
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,640
guess that's my is because it's such a

605
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,600
like a it would work as a sketch in a

606
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,640
thing you could do that as a sketch you

607
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,440
could totally maybe a web series yeah

643
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,720
time now in my head yep yep it's very

644
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,360
strange it's unusual I don't even know

645
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,480
where to go with it I don't know where

646
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,840
go there's nowhere to go with that

647
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,600
except for stop doing that uh how about

648
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,480

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,440
recommend I mean he's dead now but um it

651
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,760
was amazing yeah I would prefer to see

652
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,960
Bob new hard's oneman show I would

653
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,200
prefer Bob newart to just tell stories

654
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,960
about how great uh his life has been or

655
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,200
how weird it has been and how bad it

656
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,320
there there were bits of that in there

657
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,919
for sure and they were easily my

658
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,919
favorite parts right especially when the

659
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,360
I don't know if I'm supposed to say this

660
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,399
on microphone when especially when the

661
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,399
street jokes got a little more colorful

662
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,279
we'll just say colorful um the yeah when

663
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,440
he's talking about his life great stuff

664
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,360
uh turns out Bob new racist or do you

665
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,679
let's say racially insensitive I won't

666
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,000
say racist because it's not like I hate

667
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,559
nword you know but it's like Street

668
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,080
jokes straight up Street jokes some of

669
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,760
which have a racial tinge to them yes

670
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,760
I'm giving an old white man a break and

671
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,399
I probably shouldn't be I really but

672
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,559
he's still not Bill Cosby and that's a

673
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,320
horrible low standard to have but Bill

674
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,440
Cosby I think about Bill I've seen Bill

675
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,799
Cosby twice have you seen have you ever

676
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,960
seen Bill Cosby okay this about six

677
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,080
years ago it was before the big sure and

678
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,640
um the big reveal on Bill cos big reveal

679
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,440
the big reveal and um so I saw once then

680
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,120
a year and a half later I saw him again

681
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,880
okay and he had an entirely new hour 15

682
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,760
except one joke he did a GPS joke both

683
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,640
times okay and the GPS joke the first

684
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,320
time I saw it was the was the first GPS

685
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,480
joke I had heard okay so I it was great

686
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,320
and he's a great comic he genuinely is

687
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,600
of course and

688
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,799
um and I think about him I think about

689
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,559
him almost every week I think about Bill

690
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,880
Cosby cuz he doesn't get to go up

691
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,480
anymore but he's a comic so you know

692
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,360
he's still writing and I'm wondering

693
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,880
what jokes is he writing besides my wife

694
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:40,440

695
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,360
but you wonder what because I remember

he did very much Slice of Life he still

697
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,640
writing kind of guy not like not like

698
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,679
what you're saying Bill Bob newart ising

699
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,720

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:37,640
uh he did 15 minutes and about five or

717
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,720
six of it were those monologue jokes

718
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,399
okay and it was a lot and I was just

719
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,919
like no there he is there's those

720
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:46,200
monologue jokes who cares and then but

721
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,120
then the other nine minutes were these

722
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,399
fascinating sort of Slice of Life kind

723
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,200
of stuff I bet about his life and I was

724
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:56,159
like oh please tell me more about that

725
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,039
yeah and they had punchlines they were

726
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,519
they were set up you know I always

727
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,200
thought he was a funny dude as a standup

728
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,559
whenever I saw him on TV I just hated

729
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,840
him as a host of The Tonight Show

730
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,080
definitively he was one of the best

731
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,559
stand-ups of the 80s yeah right and just

732
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,679
I mean he had it was observational but

733
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,039
it was personal it was interesting it

734
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,279
was smart it was silly it had all the

735
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,679
good things going for he got great

736
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,679
[ __ ] Personality yeah except for when

737
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,320
it comes to business apparently you know

738
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,320
like everything else he [ __ ] great on

739
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,200
stage yeah so um so I want I I would

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,399
love to see more of that you know so I

741
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,919
think that and she really did but Walker

742
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,840
she was clearly successful because of

743
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,480
her personality because of she was super

744
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,000
likable and like you watch her on that

745
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,720
game show and you could tell that all

746
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,320

747
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:48,000
much one of the guys and

748
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,720

00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,080
at a at a just a showcasing show here in

768
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:48,399
LA and it was this woman talking about

769
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,799
her uh fiance MH and she said um she did

770
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,080
this stuff about knew her stuff about

771
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,200
how she was engaged and then she did

772
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,039
this older she what was clearly an older

773
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,720
joke about her boyfriend and she said

774
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,799
well I suppose I should tell

775
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,760
that's my fiance and it was about how um

776
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,559
he had asked if he could poop on her and

777
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,799
I was like oh my God don't marry that

778
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,360
guy uhuh uh that guy has uh serious

779
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:16,000
control issues and wants to poop on you

780
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,559
and uh and um you're fetish you want to

781
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,120
get pooped on and but she didn't want to

782
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,919
get pooped on yeah right like I mean if

783
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,919
they were both into it 100% you got to

784
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,720
have the two same Lego pieces to go yeah

785
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,200
right you have to be a person that

786
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,000
literally wants to be [ __ ] upon yep with

787
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,399
a guy that wants to [ __ ] on his

788
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,679
girlfriend and you're like I hate both

789
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,360
of you and neither of you are invited

790
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,200
over for the barbecue um but because I

791
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,679
you both would make me sad at my house

792
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,960
oh that's so disturbing so it's super

793
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,200
disturbing but comedy is so personal now

794
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,360
that's probably me oh but comedy is so

795
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,519
personal now

796
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,240
MH

797
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,120
that where you have to go to make it

798
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,200
more

799
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,360
interesting because we can't do these

800
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,240
jokes at Betty Walker was doing right we

801
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,360
have to go down this weird Rabbit Hole I

802
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,600
mean Louis CK is a perfect example right

803
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,519
that guy talk about unwanted thought

804
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,519
Centrum that guy will address the

805
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,039
creepiest thoughts that he has but

806
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:16,320
there's no one I don't

807
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,639
know I kind of love Louis CK and the

808
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,200
fact that

809
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:25,440
he's his standup he has more empathy

810
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,559
sure like he he has a way of describing

811
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,679
somebody's bad decisions own bad

812
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,320
decisions and just sort of revealing in

813
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,120
himself these sort of not great parts of

814
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,320
his

815
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,840
personality and how he's kind of working

816
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,960
on it or how he's not working on it and

817
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,080
that is also very funny though a little

818
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,559
more disappointing because you'd like

819
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,799
him to work on it did you see that SNL

820
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,000
uh set the other night I did not I've

821
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,799
there's too many don't worry so he did

822
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,440
this bit about um you know he he

823
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,679
previously he has done sort of white

824
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,880
privilege kind of jokes right and now he

825
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,639
is not just White Privilege but like the

826
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,480
1% white privileged guy right and so

827
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:16,839
he's in this situation where he's in

828
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,520
let's say a Four Seasons or Ritz and he

829
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:22,320
call and he's called down because his

830
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:24,480
laundry is supposed to be 24 hours as he

831
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,919
calls down and he's talking to this

832
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,040
woman and he talks about how he's

833
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:31,040
clearly a white man and she isn't and so

834
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,240
he should be getting better service and

835
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,440
you're like that is a disaster of a

836
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,040
premise you are a dick and he's like

837
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,839
yeah it's a glimpse into who I might

838
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,960
really be sometimes it isn't okay and

839
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,720
it's a wonderful kind of angle on it

840
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,240
absolutely yeah but and it turns out of

841
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,040
course that he has forgotten to give

842
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,159
them his laundry and but and and the

843
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,200
best part of the joke is actually how he

844
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,599
talks about how you can complain at a

845
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
Ritz Carlton but 15 years ago 20 years

846
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,440
ago when he was on the road mhm you're

847
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,760
not going to complain at a motel not

848
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,720
even a super eight just called Motel who

849
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,000
are you going to call hey there's

850
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,640
cigarette Burns in the in the in the in

851
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,640
the in the uh sheet and you're like yeah

852
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,480
what do you want me to do about it

853
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,119
you're paying $25 a night thanks exactly

854
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,000
what are you right and so he he would

855
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,400
never complain in those situations but

856
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
now because he's in this expectations

857
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,720
are so much higher yeah but at the end

858
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,880
of the joke what I didn't like and he

859
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,160
doesn't can't possibly care but what I

860
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,040
would like is sort of not a solution

861
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,839
MH because in this case the admission

862
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,440
was yeah I'm kind of a dick M and you're

863
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,359
like oh I going to want you to work on

864
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,240
that and uh CU I have this new bit that

865
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:46,560
doesn't have an end either right you

866
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,000
know and the end is is the premise is

867
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,680
that I always

868
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,960
thought that

869
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,720
I sometimes I think to myself if I die

870
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,319
an [ __ ] but I was right that'll be

871
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:04,000
fine oh believe me seal if you could

872
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:05,440

I mean there's nothing worse quite

892
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,800
honestly for me than what I'm right that

893
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:07,599
self-righteousness manifests itself in

894
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,520

901
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:27,160
the grocery store a month ago we're

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,720
living in different times MH I'm walking

903
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,280
out of the the grocery store there's an

904
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,800

in front of me out of this thing

909
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,000
80-year-old white guy and he starts

910
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,640
yelling at the rent a cop and he says

911
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,520
the n-word and he calls him a Haitian

912
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,359
and he tells him he screws monkeys and

913
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,960
that's why there's a and it goes on like

914
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:55,359
that for 40 50 seconds and 10 years ago

915
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,880
I probably would have just looked at the

916
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,560
red deop and gone the hell's it matter

917
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,040
with that guy yeah yeah and I might have

918
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,839
yelled something at the guy but that

919
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,200
would have been it but those days are

920
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,720
done and Jackie wants to be a white lady

921
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,800
meat Shield or I can't stop myself right

922
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,760
except for that I have to stop myself

923
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,160
because I want to be of some use sure

924
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,119
and me getting in the face of an

925
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,520
80-year-old man isn't necessarily the

926
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,720
best use of my my my life so I get in

927
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,200
his face and I'm yelling at him and the

928
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,480
only good thing I yelled at him and I

929
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,040
was like is there anything you wanted to

930
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,560
say about women to a middle-aged white

931
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,079
lady and uh and he was like and he was

932
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,040
like what are you talking I said you

933
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,680
can't talk to him like that it isn't

934
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,920
okay and you can't say those things cuz

935
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,520
they're horrible and you're an idiot and

936
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,359
I'm just yell and I'm swearing and I'm

937
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,800
doing all these things and finally

938
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,119
80-year-old white guy says to me I don't

939
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,160
there's nothing to do with you there's

940
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,760
none of your business and I said it has

941
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,640
everything to do with me because this is

942
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,040
America and you're horrible and it isn't

943
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:58,359
okay and he says America p and I turn

944
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,880
into a country music song and I push a

945
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:04,160
80-year-old man I don't push him down

946
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,800
but I push him and I push him into some

947
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,000
carts anyway he doesn't fall it doesn't

948
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,359
it isn't okay none of it's okay it's not

949
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,920
and uh I'll tell you what the hero

950
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:13,960
doesn't do the hero doesn't go sit in

951
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,960

952
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,880
America does after uh he's done he's

953
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,800

954
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,599
Nazis he doesn't take three days to tell

955
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,520
his husband uh that he was D jackass at

956
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,760
which point my husband was like you know

957
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,599
who carries guns 80-year-old white guys

958
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,640
that is a good point so uh how about you

959
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,880
keep it together and you don't hurt the

960
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:37,160
elderly yeah and I was like okay he said

961
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,680
you can yell at the guy you could say

962
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,520
things but there's no yeah keep it

963
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:48,440
together is I want to be of some use but

964
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:51,079
that isn't anyway so that story is

965
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,960
essentially I don't want to die an

966
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,200
[ __ ] uhhuh and me pushing an

967
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,079
80-year-old man is me being an [ __ ]

968
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,920
sure and so I realized in that moment

969
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,960
that even if I'm right I still die an

970
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,240
[ __ ] so I don't want I don't want

971
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,640
to right and Alive are both super super

972
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,440
helpful right and

973
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,160
not as bad as the person that I'm

974
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,200
fighting exactly I don't want to turn

975
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,680
into that guy yeah no that's the fear we

976
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,480
all have I think

977
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,960
right and yeah I don't know if I should

978
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,640
be laughing at it or not but it is

979
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,680
really funny funny hopefully there's a

980
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,240
bit there cuz I wasn't there that's why

981
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,720
it's funny that's why Comedy Works oh my

982
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,800
God yeah yeah the

983
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:36,079
way remove

984
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,359
distance could now I don't know I'm just

985
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,079
the more I think about Betty Walker I'm

986
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm again I enjoyed it yeah it is but it

987
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,599
is one note and it's so hard again I

988
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,520
don't know how she suspends 40 minutes

989
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:51,359
maybe she doesn't maybe it's not 40

990
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,359
minutes of of of worth it uh but I I

991
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,200
don't know what else she ever did but it

992
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,079
also seems like that is the perfect kind

993
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,640
of person to I mean she did on the phone

994
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,960
what you again Phil Siler was a good

995
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,480
example I mean that was all housewife

996
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,880
stuff I mean that was all like what it

997
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,280
was like I actually like there's some

998
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,520
people who I like Joan Rivers who it's

999
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,200
actually really hard to talk about what

1000
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,040
Joan how she evolved as a comic because

1001
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,400
she released two albums in her whole

1002
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,560
lifetime because she didn't need to

1003
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,440
bother you know so it's hard to say like

1004
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,000
she goes from like this album and then

1005
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,960
17 years later like super [ __ ] famous

1006
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,119
Joan Rivers rich off her ass still

1007
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,160
really funny right really funny but an

1008
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:31,480
entirely different kind of comic exactly

1009
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:34,160
but then the beauty of this of of of a

1010
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,079
career where you put out an album you

1011
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,160
know and like if you listen that's why

1012
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,839
it's I mean Doug Stan hope puts out an

1013
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,480
album like every year every year and a

1014
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,359
half right it's but if you listen to my

1015
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,000
albums and by God you ought to

1016
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:52,400
absolutely uh you can you get the

1017
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,599
evolution and plus to some extent uh

1018
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,520
especially with my albums because

1019
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,839
they're they tend to be more about my

1020
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,200
dad my parents and my siblings and my in

1021
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,880
my life so you get the story of my life

1022
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,040
and so like if you go the first album I

1023
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,480
did I did it and it is if you find it oh

1024
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,240
my God rip it quick because it'll

1025
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,800
disintegrate around you because it was

1026
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,720
one of those those ones where I burned

1027
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,480
it on my computer yeah it's called cake

1028
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,119
it's not my downfall and a lot of the

1029
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,920
material that's on that album is on

1030
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,480
bread okay but um circus people is the

1031
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,319
first sort of professional album I ever

1032
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,119
did and that's on CD Baby and it's on my

1033
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:30,880
it of course but it's available you can

1034
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,000
listen to it for free on all the things

1035
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,400
okay um but if you listen I don't like

1036
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,760
that album very much um

1037
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,440
because it's sort of no longer in

1038
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,800
sequence because cake is not my downfall

1039
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,559
uh is out of print and will never be in

1040
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,559
print uh and Mo and the best of that

1041
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:51,079
material is on bread okay it's sort of

1042
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,040
out of order so you should get bread and

1043
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,000
then listen to Circus people and

1044
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,800
there'll be some overlap of the of the

1045
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,839
jokes quite honestly and that's fine um

1046
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,280
and the one guy who emailed me and said

1047
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,440
why are there the same jokes on two

1048
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,720
albums you can [ __ ] off uh quite

1049
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,359
honestly there are believe me one of my

1050
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,880
favorite comedians is Rusty Warren who

1051
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,480
mostly because I think she's fantastic

1052
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,079
and adorable she signed that for me

1053
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,000
lucky me The Woman released about 15

1054
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:20,760
albums and she overlaps on every album

1055
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,359
oh every album every album I mean cuz

1056
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,000
she was a club comic and she was a club

1057
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:26,359
comic who had a bit she did she had

1058
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,440
songs she did every time songs she mixed

1059
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:30,480
up the intro to the songs was the same

1060
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,559
but she was Charming as [ __ ] so it's

1061
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,920
okay right and it um when did she work

1062
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,960
uh okay Rusty her last album I could be

1063
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,319
full of [ __ ] 76 or 78 late 7s but she's

1064
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,400
early 60s to late 7s okay and she had a

1065
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,760
Vegas stretch in there too like she but

1066
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,319
she could never get on Carson cuz she

1067
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,079
was dirty even though listen to Joan

1068
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,880
River well I don't think she was that

1069
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,200
dirty she probably Listen to George

1070
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,319
Carlin exactly right believe me believe

1071
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,160
me I I'm just with just the reason cuz

1072
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:00,960
Johnny Carson love lovely as he might

1073
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,839
have been was a giant sexist and a

1074
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,520
homophobe I mean it's it's we're allowed

1075
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:06,040
to say that right I think I'm allowed to

1076
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,000
say that yeah I don't think I don't

1077
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,839
think you're breaking any ground right

1078
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,599
saying that uh I and and if you think

1079
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:16,000
that Johnny Carson wasn't a bit of a

1080
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,559
sexist watch any of the sketches watch

1081
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,160
any of them absolutely any of the

1082
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,920
sketches with the booby ladies and him

1083
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,240
tripping and accidentally grouping one

1084
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,400
of them you big weirdo and it's grossu

1085
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,640
but um yeah mhm so there we go there's

1086
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,040
that but yeah I mean but again like

1087
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,599
again who gives there's overlap that's

1088
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,520
fine but but if you but if you listen

1089
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,760
like Brad Brad was my first I

1090
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,680
think I mean circus people has some good

1091
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,520
fun stuff on it it's

1092
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,319
fine but bread and then horcrux and then

1093
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,559
this new one hero is

1094
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:54,800
um those three I'm super proud of all of

1095
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,800
them and I am a different comic on each

1096
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,960
of them yeah yeah and so it's it's

1097
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,520
fascinating um if I listen to more

1098
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,000
comedy I bet you'd find that with other

1099
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,200
Comics you guys you should totally do

1100
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,079
that with Pat and Oswalt absolutely you

1101
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,800
should actually and I could tell why

1102
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,280
later but yeah you should it would be

1103
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,960
neat to just to follow somebody's career

1104
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,599
like if you listen to like Maria Bamford

1105
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,400
oh yeah uh let's talk about her again

1106
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,319
yeah um just because like I help her

1107
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,839
with her merch I was just helping her

1108
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,440
and she has she had three albums we were

1109
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:30,680
selling in Phoenix last weekend and um I

1110
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:35,280
believe she has a total of five albums

1111
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:38,200
out okay and talk about like The Burning

1112
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:43,000
Bridges tour I think is the first album

1113
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:44,480
how to win uh is second album um I don't

1114
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,359
know if unwanted thought syndrome is

1115
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,400
third but what and then 20% just came

1116
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,079
out yeah and uh there might be one

1117
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,960
another one in there but if you were to

1118
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,160
listen to each of those albums you would

1119
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,200
see you would you would actually get the

1120
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,280
Arc of a person MH kind of healing

1121
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,839
themselves using comedy absolutely which

1122
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:09,440
is a neat thing to hear MH and

1123
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,839
um I don't know it's it's why when I've

1124
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,599
hear that like Aaron Jackson or Wendy

1125
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,599
leedman um or

1126
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,040
um uh any number of comics that I know

1127
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,920
don't have albums and you're like well

1128
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,720
Wendy Leeman not having an album is a

1129
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,240
crime against uh Humanity I think she

1130
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,920
has a DVD out that's it and I'm like oh

1131
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,720
my God because she could be on

1132
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,160
television doing 5 minutes and never

1133
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,319
repeat herself every night for a year

1134
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,720
right right right right okay because

1135
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,960
she's a damn genius and those jokes are

1136
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,319
perfect for five

1137
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,240
minutes and um so I don't know why she's

1138
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,880
not on all of the it'd be great if she

1139
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,520
did a different how great would like a

1140
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,559
four-day week where she did like Monday

1141
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,800
on Fallon Tuesday on colar Wednesday on

1142
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,559
Conan Thursday it would just be it' be

1143
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,160
fun for me I would I I would love yeah I

1144
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,880
mean it really drives me crazy when

1145
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,839
people don't have albums obviously but I

1146
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,240
don't giv you have a podcast exactly but

1147
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:06,520
I don't know if I've ever heard other

1148
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,480
than going to see Maria record her last

1149
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,800
album the one she did at UCB which is

1150
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,720
that the 20% is that 20% no um maybe

1151
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,160
yeah maybe okay so I saw that and that

1152
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,960
was amazing but I don't know her I just

1153
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,599
went cuz I'm a huge fan right yeah but I

1154
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,200
didn't I haven't heard her other albums

1155
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,839
all I knew of her growing up was seeing

1156
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,640
her on TV oh that's the voice lady

1157
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,200
that's all I knew yeah yeah you know and

1158
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,599
then eventually she gets personal and

1159
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,160
[ __ ] I wish I to other albums well an

1160
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,760
attainable goal holy smokes talk about U

1161
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,880
like on my Pandora station you know how

1162
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,520
you can make a Pandora station and so I

1163
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,880
made mine and so my Al my albums are on

1164
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,200
there but it's just it'll go to like

1165
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,720
Rachel Feinstein or Jen Kirkman or Maria

1166
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,000
Bamford or any you know gronowski or or

1167
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,359
any anybody's

1168
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,680
and it's always you know if you've been

1169
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,200
doing standup like as long as I've been

1170
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,440
doing standup my first album that cake

1171
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,640
album probably I think i' printed it in

1172
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:04,280
'98 okay but my but circus people came

1173
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:09,200
out I think in 2000 or 2001 and then

1174
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:12,240
bread was in 2003 or four and

1175
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,359
um that's not right who cares well but

1176
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:18,040
there's they're like literally I've done

1177
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:20,119
four albums in the last 10 years or or

1178
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,200
12

1179
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,640
and it's really it's for the and I've

1180
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,280
been doing standup comedy for about 27

1181
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,200
28 years yeah those first

1182
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,079
15

1183
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,079
years I'm not I'm not sad that I don't

1184
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:36,920
have those albums because that that

1185
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,040
standup is going to be very different

1186
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,760
sure I mean circus people is brutal

1187
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,160
enough for me so uh but I know Comics

1188
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,200
like I always encourage like the

1189
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,720
features because I do the road of fair

1190
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,200
amount that's what I do right and so I

1191
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,520
headline the road the opener uh there's

1192
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,000
no money in featuring in doing the

1193
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,400
middle spot on the road so as soon as

1194
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,880
you have or 40 minutes get an album out

1195
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:06,000
right because and it'll be fascinating

1196
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,119
and irritating to you um 20 years from

1197
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,839
now if you keep doing it yeah because

1198
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:11,280
you know especially if you could like I

1199
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,799
like to come out with an album every two

1200
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,319
and a half to three years yeah because I

1201
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:18,880
want the jokes to be done sure and um

1202
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:22,160
that's why the first 10 12 minutes of

1203
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,359
hero is so um fascinating to me to some

1204
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,040
extent because those some of those jokes

1205
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,400
are I've only done them a half a dozen

1206
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,000
times really oh [ __ ] handful of times

1207
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,480
doesn't feel that way well that's good

1208
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,720
um cuz but they have a couple of them

1209
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,680
have better punch lines now okay okay

1210
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,680
all right but

1211
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:42,359
um but they're

1212
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,359
so and but I'll tell you what some of

1213
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,720
them couple of them have better punch

1214
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,319
lines but a couple of them aren't as

1215
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,079
good as they were those first six times

1216
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:51,000
because I wasn't as emotional about all

1217
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:53,440
right okay and sometimes that emotion

1218
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,720
will add another layer to the stand up

1219
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,000
Scorpio

1220
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,799
Rising don't say that s it's very

1221
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,040
logical listen to me she explained it to

1222
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:06,599
me she said look a Scorpio Rising is a

1223
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:09,799
fixed water sign I am a pure Leo no that

1224
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:13,319
means that I am complete fire complete

1225
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:17,040
now she says Mrs tman what happens when

1226
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:18,920
you mix fire and water when you mix Fire

1227
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,520
and Water you get

1228
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,760
Steam and steam is the story of my

1229
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,920
marriage yeah no she gave me a little

1230
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,400
hope no she said to me that uh she said

1231
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,319
your husband can be a wonderful man she

1232
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,240
said he's wonderful when Jupiter hits

1233
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:39,559
his natal

1234
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:43,799
house this happens once in 12

1235
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,799
years and I missed it both

1236
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,240
times oh I yeah I agree I mean there's a

1237
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,119
bit on there that isn't even a joke that

1238
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,119
kind of made me tear up a little bit the

1239
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,200
genocide thing uh was just what the [ __ ]

1240
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,480
was the line it was like how exactly did

1241
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,480
you put it nobody gets on the trains is

1242
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,319
that how' you say it yeah yeah yeah yeah

1243
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,160
I was like I was like oh [ __ ] that got

1244
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,720
real and it was great it was perfect it

1245
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,640
was a perfect moment for it that's

1246
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,960
that's how that should work I but I also

1247
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,319
like the idea of every two and a half

1248
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,200
three years you're doing it rather than

1249
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,119
every year because you can't hear the

1250
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,559
evolution from one album to another you

1251
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,440
have to hear a gap yeah for me anyway

1252
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,920
like it's it's like if it's every year

1253
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,520
cool if that's good for you and your

1254
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,440
people are going to buy it [ __ ] great

1255
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,160
you're going to make the money but for

1256
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,760
me yeah I'd rather hear well that's why

1257
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,799
I like as much as I I truly enjoy Louis

1258
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,880
I like watching him

1259
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:34,240
um but it's when he was putting out an

1260
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,559
album or a new special every year I

1261
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,640
remember watching him because I'm I also

1262
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,960
don't listen to albums or watch specials

1263
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,359
but I'd see the set or I'd see something

1264
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,040
I'd see him perform and I'd think oh my

1265
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,760
God how great will that be that joke be

1266
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,559
in another six months yeah yeah yeah

1267
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,839
yeah because if he if he came out every

1268
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,000
18 months instead of every year and I've

1269
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:54,720
heard actually that he said he's done

1270
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,240
with the every year thing because he

1271
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,640
doesn't his plate is too full and he

1272
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,880
can't finish the jokes in tou sure and

1273
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,280
so yeah yeah let them marinate man just

1274
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,880
think about how great they'll be if they

1275
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,160
marinate and uh because you'll come up

1276
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,319
with another another punchline or two I

1277
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,799
did the political stuff because I

1278
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,240
thought we'd all be dead and for some

1279
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:15,599
reason I thought well let the aliens

1280
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,520
find it yeah and uh you

1281
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,000
know well and that I mean the crazy

1282
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,480
thing is like when I hear I mean you

1283
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,839
actually call yourself out on it at the

1284
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,000
beginning of the album wait let's say to

1285
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,319
the name of the album before we keep

1286
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,359
talking about I not the hero of the

1287
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:29,000
story thank you not the ER of the story

1288
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,640
is my new album it came out at the

1289
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,359
beginning of March 2017 and it did

1290
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,880
things that none of my other albums did

1291
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,960
which was it was number one on Amazon

1292
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,680
and iTunes uh for sales and then number

1293
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,000
three on Billboard number three on

1294
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,960
Billboard without a bullet you guys it

1295
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
opened at three then that was it okay

1296
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,960
but it had never made billboard so I'm

1297
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,359
excited that's awesome yeah now all

1298
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,359
that's left is for at the end of the

1299
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:54,280
year it to be critically acclaimed and

1300
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:55,920
on those lists of course uh CU those are

1301
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,960
the lists I also enjoy of course of

1302
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,440
course you

1303
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,160
person but that I mean but that's it

1304
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,240
like you call yourself out for like uh

1305
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,520
you know not normally being political

1306
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,599
but feeling it as a necessity you don't

1307
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,200
often like I find myself having to

1308
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,520
listen back again I'm listening trying

1309
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,359
to listen to a comedy album every day

1310
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,040
this year oh wow it's a pain in the ass

1311
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,480
I'm 20 albums behind already because

1312
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,960
it's so hard to Duke with all my other

1313
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,359
[ __ ] yeah but when you listen to stuff

1314
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,680
you and I who was I I think it was when

1315
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:23,200
I was interviewing Tommy Chong the other

1316
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,520
day I was like hey I know I'm going to

1317
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,240
overe examine this cuz I have my head up

1318
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,440
my ass like I admitted it I'm like cuz I

1319
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,920
just just how it goes like so you find

1320
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,280
yourself picking apart like maybe they

1321
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,799
meant this like you get super way too

1322
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,319
intellectual about it sometimes it

1323
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:37,720
really really helps when somebody does

1324
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,400
that and says I don't normally get

1325
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,319
political now I'm getting political

1326
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,319
enjoy or don't like it it is actually

1327
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:47,040
kind of helpful to have that as a as an

1328
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:49,799
earmark you know well it's

1329
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,960
um it's funny because I did that I

1330
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:53,880
recorded them at Acme in Minneapolis

1331
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:58,119
where I've done all my albums it's my

1332
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,559
home club and that audience is trained

1333
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:01,079
and standup comedy audiences live

1334
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:04,920
standup comedy audiences are more

1335
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:06,480
tolerant than any any just normal people

1336
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,760
like if you go to a very conservative

1337
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,160
State like I'm going to Birmingham next

1338
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,200
month and um Alabama and but I'm I'm

1339
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,280
performing for standup comedy audiences

1340
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,680
sure who will sit there and go well I

1341
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,520
don't agree with your politics but that

1342
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,760
was a funny joke yeah and that's what

1343
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:26,079
they'll do they'll sit there and do that

1344
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,760
I was in Poria and um I started in I was

1345
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,760
did some of the I have new political

1346
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,240
jokes because I I'm I'm having a hard

1347
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,119
time writing anything but because it's

1348
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,960
on my brain and I don't want to some

1349
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,880
woman came up to me the other I was in

1350
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,599
Phoenix and this or Tucson this woman

1351
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,640
comes up and she goes you know this is

1352
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,280
the third time I've seen you and I think

1353
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,240
the political stuff is your Forte I

1354
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,480
think that's going to be your thing and

1355
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,480
I said I don't want it to be my thing

1356
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,440
because I'm angry and I don't want to be

1357
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,880
angry and what I'd like to be is happy

1358
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,440
and then write those down I think that's

1359
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,240
been established anyway so um but I was

1360
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,799
in PUO and I started in on this

1361
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,000
political chunk and and um and I don't

1362
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,760
say president psychos uh name uh in any

1363
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,720
of my material appreciate that as well

1364
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,119
and yeah I don't want to talk about uh

1365
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,240
I'm not a reality TV person either so uh

1366
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,799
but the

1367
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,680
uh but I started talking about the

1368
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,839
present the current Administration and

1369
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,240
um I just start getting this glare from

1370
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,000
this dude like the second row and I go

1371
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,799
you know you can hate me all you want

1372
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,880
man but I'm getting walked in my car so

1373
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:31,119
[ __ ] off you know I'm like it doesn't

1374
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,200
I'm going to talk about this if you

1375
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,200
don't like it you can bail it's hardly I

1376
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,799
don't know what you what else you want

1377
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,079
me to I mean I'd love to talk about dogs

1378
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:45,079
of course of course if I could write a

1379
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:47,079
puppy bit we'd all win well I mean

1380
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:48,640
Carlin got start don't get me wrong I

1381
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:50,520
love early George Carlin way more than I

1382
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,240
like later Carlin much as I appreciate

1383
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,039
the art of what he did as an angry man

1384
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,359
on stage even though like if you saw him

1385
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,720
off stage he was less angry seeming uh I

1386
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,680
think a lot of people like him got

1387
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,359
started on those I'm not saying you're

1388
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,000
going to become a political comedian

1389
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:06,160
especially if you don't want to be but

1390
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,039
like reticence is always a huge part of

1391
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,559
it I don't want to be reticence is a is

1392
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:11,640
a is a part of it if you're like

1393
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:13,200
willingly angry about everything that's

1394
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,119
either boring or somehow really

1395
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,960
fascinating if it's Lewis Black but like

1396
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,559
you know uh or I guess to some people

1397
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,599
Kenn it's it's a short it it it it's a

1398
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,400
tiny part of the spectrum yeah and if

1399
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,880
you can rock it rock it sure but

1400
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:31,599
otherwise I don't even want to ex I I

1401
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:35,000
did Kelly Carlin's show on XM and

1402
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:37,839
um I admitted that I had not heard any

1403
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,359
of her dad and she was like ah thank God

1404
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,640
finally the person who doesn't know who

1405
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,920
the hell he is and she's like I loved

1406
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:47,119
him but Jesus I can't take the

1407
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,559
canonization or whatever right yeah and

1408
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,480
I it was interesting because I had done

1409
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,599
two XM series one with Jay Thomas M who

1410
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,920
played a right-wing blowhard on Murphy

1411
00:56:54,599 --> 00:57:00,079
Brown and then Ria butcher rightwing

1412
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,599
blow hard husband on Cheers and it turns

1413
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,599
out that was a typ casting cuz he's got

1414
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:07,400
a radio show on XM serious and the first

1415
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,880

1454
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,799
Target and then uh either bank robbers

1455
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,119
or terrorists break into the Target

1456
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,200
right at closing time and so we are

1457
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,760
trapped somewhere in the toy department

1458
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:50,920
and we use toys and found objects in

1459
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,960
Target to stop the bad guys in a home

1460
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,799
alone like moment I love this idea very

1461
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,400
much it's a buddy movie and then she

1462
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:59,599

pharmacist okay or I could or two actors

1464
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,520

1465
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,480
to sell this idea I love this idea and

1466
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,880
uh I'm stealing it no but I love this

1467
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:10,520

1468
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,839
or whatever sure sure sure garun lot

1469
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,559
buddy movie done it's a good idea two

1470
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:17,240
two more skinny white girls on on camera

1471
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,839
that's a very good idea let's do this um

1472
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,440
in their 20s early 30s let's do it yeah

1473
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:24,079
um okay so let's do this because yeah

1474
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,839
are we at an hour we're just about at an

1475
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,520
hour I'm a little sniffly I'm sorry how

1476
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:30,240
dare you how dare you be sniffly uh okay

1477
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,440
so let's talk about Betty Walker's album

1478
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,280
because the only reason we didn't have a

1479
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,960
ton to say about it is cuz it might not

1480
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,680
it was funny but it's like it's funny

1481
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,920
there's not as much to say about it cuz

1482
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,799
it's it doesn't age well Soul CH

1483
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,599
changing at all exactly right it was I

1484
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,960
was glad that I picked it though sure me

1485
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:48,559
too 100% because um I never heard of her

1486
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,039
MH and I was like oh I wonder what she

1487
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:53,640
was doing and some of it was great and

1488
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,400
it was interest and she was interesting

1489
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,039
through the whole thing yeah and look at

1490
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,280
those eyes man man she looks like she's

1491
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:01,960
smarter than the average bear right look

1492
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,480
like like like super smart and really

1493
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,760
funny and I

1494
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,640
think if she were alive today like if

1495
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,559
she were doing standup now that it would

1496
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,559
be much more updated and much more she

1497
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:15,079
would roll with it I absolutely and I

1498
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:16,440
actually think it might have fit right

1499
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:18,520
it would have been fun to watch her do

1500
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,440
it maybe that might have been more of

1501
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,160
what people were laughing at too I want

1502
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,480
to know I don't know oh right cuz it's

1503
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,440
best with comedy the way it goes for me

1504
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,440
I like to see it live MH then I like to

1505
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,000
listen to it on audio okay that's the

1506
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,720
next step all right uh and then video

1507
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,760
okay because video there's that

1508
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,720
separation of screen least favorite way

1509
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,640
to watch standup comedy when it is part

1510
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:43,000
of a plot of a TV show o yeah sure it's

1511
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:47,599
a sure or a movie AA your punch lines

1512
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:50,319
are your uh Julie Kushner Julie whatever

1513
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,760
polka dot uh movie about uh a standup

1514
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,880
comic anyway her hook was that she wore

1515
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,480
polka dots oh okay I see that's that's

1516
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,520
just good writing yeah oh abut but

1517
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,960
there's a new there's a new a new TV

1518
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,839
show that I I admit to being interested

1519
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,720
in it's with Al madal on Showtime called

1520
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,680
I'm dying up here oh is it the one about

1521
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,480
the backstage of Carson [ __ ] it's like

1522
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,200
uh I think so 70s early 70s and he's

1523
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,880
supposed to play like a Freddy Prince

1524
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:19,799
like character the man guy okay and

1525
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:22,720
um so that could I mean the weird thing

1526
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:24,160
is is the standup you just you can't no

1527
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,799
one's willing to give away their a

1528
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,799
material no of course so

1529
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,280
there's no way to portray stand-up

1530
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:33,799
comedy as funny as it is yeah when it's

1531
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,359
like on an episode of Bones and someone

1532
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:38,839
has been killed and uh then you got to

1533
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:40,240
watch a standup comic he's like well

1534
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:41,760
he's got reason to kill and the worst

1535
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,520
part is they hire a [ __ ] standup

1536
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,880
comic to do it and then you've got to

1537
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,079
look like you don't know how to be a

1538
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,359
standup right but there's no but you

1539
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:51,960
don't say no cuz everyone needs $1,000

1540
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:53,920
of course not yeah why would you not

1541
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,599

1612
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,440
comedy for Brian Regan just because he's

1613
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,799
clean yeah yeah yeah yeah and and for

1614
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:44,760
Maria yeah because the thing is is like

1615
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,319
if I'm just doing my the greatest thing

1616
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,920
about working with Maria is Maria wants

1617
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:50,599
me to go as weird and she's the one

1618
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:53,559
who's constantly saying do the genocide

1619
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:55,839
bit I'm like the genocide bit is

1620
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:59,000
emotionally draining of course it is so

1621
01:04:55,839 --> 01:05:00,400
to do it is I have to gird my loins

1622
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,920
essentially and then bring up the

1623
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,599
