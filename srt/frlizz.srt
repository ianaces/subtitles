205
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,360
doing stand-up comedy eight years eight

206
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,760
years yeah I did it on a dare how was a

207
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,760
dare uh somebody said do it I was in

208
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,560
college and they said you know why don't

209
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,360
you get up there and vent this anger to

210
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,839
somebody else besides us so I said okay

211
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,760
I'll try it so I went to dudly rigs on

212
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,800
open mic night and Jeff Cesario was the

213
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,200
host okay so he was just starting out in

214
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,360
comedy kind of and I was just sort of

215
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,279
starting out and uh I did it and it was

216
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,920
real fun and you kept it going so you

217
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,600
were were you like always a Class Clown

218
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,720
and no I was more like the class cynic

219
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,640
oh that okay so watch that kind of

220
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,040
biting Edge humor because the type of

221
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,000
humor that you do is a little it's

222
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,440
Unique and in fact that you Carri that

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,519
into your play now yeah yeah how would

224
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,839
you describe your comedy uh now I would

225
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,920
say uh it's social commentary um

226
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,600
definitely uh with a liberal slant to it

227
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,600
um I attack everybody from uh

228
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,040
uh George Bush to you all the way down

229
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,360
the food chain I guess he's the worst on

230
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,240
my food chain and then it just goes down

231
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,800
from there okay yeah okay with with the

232
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,680
different types of Comedy that you do

233
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,680
with the different topics that you talk

234
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,000
on when you started off what type of

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,399
Comedy you did the same type of thing um

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,360
I was always sort of had an edge but it

237
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:55,120
was more observational I talked uh more

238
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,920
about my experiences back then are

239
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
different than my experiences now so

240
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,959
they just sort of evolved it's sort of

241
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
been the same thing although when you're

242
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,120
in college you really don't have a real

243
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,680
life to live because you're so focused

244
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
in on school that it doesn't Dawn on you

245
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
that wait a minute the minute I'm out of

246
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,640
school after to realize what life really

247
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,079
is and the minute I realized what life

248
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,000
really was that's when I really went off

249
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,160
with my comedy and said I got to talk

250
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,640
about this stuff okay okay how many

251
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,640
years had you been doing it before you

252
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,560
went professional

253
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,079
um about four really okay so you've been

254
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,000
doing it four years full time now four

255
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,680
years without a job okay yeah being a

256
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
ComEd is really a tough life like it's

257
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,000
not all the glamour being on the road

258
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,399
and right material they think it is

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,440
right it isn't

260
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,240
right it's really a challenge to do well

261
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,399
yeah I mean you're in really bad Motel

262
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,959
sixes with you know truckers pounding on

263
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,519
your door trying to get in and you know

264
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,000
filthy towels and cockroaches and you

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,360
know you get to the gig and it's this

266
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,240
weird one nighter where some guy with

267
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,839
three teeth hands you a microphone and

268
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,480
says okay go ahead we got a bachelor

269
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:59,480
party full of bunch of farmers and oh

270
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,160
God how has the comedy scene Chang over

271
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,399
the

272
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,079
years um audience wise or as far as the

273
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,639
club what do you mean I mean as uh Club

274
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,519
wise Club wise I think it's changed a

275
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:15,079
lot it's become very corporate it used

276
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,880
to be that comedy was equated with jazz

277
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,680
um you the same sort of people would go

278
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,839
see it people wanted to listen they

279
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,240
wanted to hear alternative things now

280
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,200
it's become very sort of

281
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,720
homogenized um it's about sell it's

282
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,560
about selling drinks it's about U making

283
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,800
a lot of money instead of making a

284
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,000
quality show right and and now the

285
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,480
market has changed because there's so

286
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,399
many comedians out there cuz comedy is

287
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,160
so hot yeah it's weird too because what

288
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
happens is these comedy clubs are

289
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,480
opening up so fast because they know

290
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
it's a way to make a buck and they're

291
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,600
forcing uh they need bodies right to

292
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,920
work these clubs and so what's happening

293
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,399
is the kids that aren't really ready to

294
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,800
be working in the clubs yet are being

295
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,680
put into situations where they have to

296
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,440
write material that might not be up to

297
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,959
standards of what they were but they

298
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,399
want to work and they have to work so um

299
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,639
they don't develop uh as well as they

300
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,079
could if they could just keep doing the

301
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,560
open mics and keep their da job and

302
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,240
working it out uhhuh it's kind of a

303
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,639
shame really mhm because when you're

304
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,040
forced to go out on the road you're

305
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,120
forced to lower your standards about

306
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,480
what you want to talk about so things

307
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,399
get really dirty they get really um

308
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,000
unchallenging and it's like I don't want

309
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,839
to me if I'm an audience person I don't

310
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,560
want to be treated like I'm stupid by

311
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,839
somebody giving me really stupid jokes I

312
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,000
get mad at that and what happens

313
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,959
especially I've never heard you comment

314
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,360
I read the article in the Twin City

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,720
reader that you go on the road and you

316
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,279
do penis jokes because that seems to

317
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,800
work I mean that's what you have on the

318
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,560
road you have to like take to the penis

319
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,720
lowest common denominated so I just

320
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,120
don't want to do it anymore so that's

321
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,079
why I said wait a minute I can either do

322
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,279
my act or I can succumb to what needs to

323
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,399
be done on the road and I just said I

324
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,040
don't want to go out on the road and be

325
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,120
really dirty and ridiculous now I

326
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,399
mentioned the twin CI reader article

327
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,480
what do you feel about the local comedy

328
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,120
scene there's a lot of controversy

329
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,360
around that article there you know what

330
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,560
I'm referring to oh the Scott hen

331
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,360
article yeah you wanted me to say the

332
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:58,240
Scott hon Artic sure sure cover in your

333
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:01,120
ass sure sure you know that article I'm

334
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
talking about right now

335
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,959
I mean I think some of it was very valid

336
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,639
Scott Hansen um you know basically runs

337
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,320
the show in the Twin Cities you know and

338
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,360
but the one of the problem is too though

339
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,519
that the comics have to get out and go

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,519
out and just and go to other cities and

341
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,680
try to work um you know if somebody if

342
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,639
you can take advantage of somebody

343
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,600
unfortunately as human beings we just do

344
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,160
right and so that's what happens you

345
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,959
know he's got this group of people that

346
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,560
don't push themselves and don't go out

347
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,040
to to other cities and uh want to make

348
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,720
money right away so they go to Scott

349
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,360
Hansen and he gets to say what happens

350
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,600
cuz he's the only guy right that's very

351
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,560
true well I tell you what in a few

352
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,040

once again with Liz Winston we're

379
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,519
talking about the comedy scene uh the

380
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,680
the one woman play that you're in yes

381
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,800
what was the concept behind the play the

382
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,279
concept behind the play was I wanted to

383
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,920
get out of comedy clubs where I wouldn't

384
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,680
have to battle waitresses um people

385
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,000
would be able to sit down in chairs not

386
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,000
be bothered with hecklers be able to

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,440
listen and to take standup comedy um to

388
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
a a step up okay um to be able to

389
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,600
combine my own life with the comedy so

390
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,560
it's the whole show was real everything

391
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,639
in the show is true and it's my opinions

392
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,480
about how I view the life and how um

393
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,920
the80s have just influenced me and what

394
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,680
I've seen and what I think people need

395
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,399
to see with what's going on how have the

396
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,480
80s influenced you they've made me even

397
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,399
angrier well it's it's just like you

398
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,240
think things change and he thinks

399
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,720
there's change but there isn't you know

400
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,079
I feel like we're you know we're going

401
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,759
into the '90s but we're stepping back

402
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,160
into the 50s in a lot of ways that's

403
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,319
true with censorship it's just like

404
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,279
McCarthyism and with David Duke in

405
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:13,440
Louisiana it's just like this whole

406
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,240
bizarre KKK thing is still alive and

407
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,920
well in the South and it just makes you

408
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,079
wonder how far have we progressed right

409
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,600
and so many of these stories there's

410
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,880
articles this big in the paper about it

411
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
you know you never read about it because

412
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,480
people don't don't want to let the

413
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,639
American people know that hey this stuff

414
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,319
really exists you know just keep

415
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,880
thinking that it's really nice and we're

416
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:33,959
America so isn't it great that we just

417
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,160
get to go bomb you know the crap out of

418
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,560
a bunch of people over there who had

419
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,920
nothing to do with one guy that we sold

420
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,360
arms to you know right right right that

421
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,959
you did someone clap a little bit there

422
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,160
are are you okay okay okay okay that's

423
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,759
kind that's frustrating the whole War

424
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,560
thing really got me really what what

425
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,600
really got Liz Winstead's Gander about

426
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,880
that war just the whole fact that we

427
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,920
funded this psycho and then we you know

428
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,240
act like it's his fault the only

429
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,440
something that you talked about I I saw

430
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,880
the plate I loved it you talked about

431
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,480
some facts that I didn't I didn't even

432
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,959
know a lot of people don't know yeah

433
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,799
about what we did yeah about selling him

434
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,919
arms then he yeah I mean a lot of stuff

435
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,319
that we did we uh well

436
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,079
gosh tell me tell me this um with the uh

437
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,120
with the

438
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,280
play it's the it's in the theater but a

439
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,439
lot of it is standup and like it's it's

440
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,760
a fine line between theater and stand up

441
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,959
it's really a unique mixture I was

442
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,280
something that was really cool that was

443
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,039
you came out can I give this away what

444
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,120
you did right at first yeah she comes

445
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,960
out and she's like got a backpack on the

446
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,200
set is like an apartment right and she

447
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,280
comes out and she says who wants coffee

448
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,960
and she goes out and gets everybody

449
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,160
coffee yeah soever just kind of and she

450
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,600
I thought she was joking cuz I didn't

451
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,240
get a

452
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,240
cup well you weren't very fancy that you

453
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,080
were toned down that that was very toned

454
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
down very toned down we talk about

455
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,240
leaving the cities here you first left

456
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,039
here and went to San Francisco what's

457
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,000
the comedy scene out cuz I hear La the

458
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,400
comedy scene is so rough and tough and

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
people are stepping on each other to get

460
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,039
ahead was it like that yeah you find out

461
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
who your friends are uhhuh it's very

462
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:08,840
bizarre because Los Angeles is a city

463
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,440
that is solely based and created for the

464
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,880
entertainment industry right so

465
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,120
everybody there it's like I pump gas but

466
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,679
I want to direct you know it's like

467
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,200
nobody has a real job please you know

468
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,320
you die to meet a plumber who was just a

469
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,080
plumber I'd probably marry

470
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,200
him well I'll fix some pipes any day oh

471
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,559
I'm sure you would shut up now shut up

472
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,240
anyway but so the scene out there so the

473
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,440
scene there is like you when you're

474
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,640
having a conversation with somebody you

475
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,880
never know why they're being nice to you

476
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,600
you always feel like they're going to be

477
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,440
nice to you until they kind of find out

478
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,120
who you are and if you can or cannot

479
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,919
help their career and if you can't

480
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,640
you're out conversation over and they're

481
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,640
always kind of looking around and who

482
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,120
here is better to talk to and it's it's

483
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,480
really bizarre sort of smoing constantly

484
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,080
and unreality and you can't do anything

485
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,200
there that doesn't involve trying to get

486
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,080
on TV in some way okay it's impossible

487
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,840
okay but you did get on TV yeah how were

488
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,480
you able to do that it well my HBO thing

489
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,159
was a fluke I was living in San

490
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,720
Francisco at the time and I was working

491
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:11,039
at this dive and um I had to go drive an

492
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,120
hour to do this um showcase for

493
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,240
something else and Robin Williams and

494
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
this manager happened to be in the

495
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,400
audience at this club in San Francisco

496
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,120
okay so I got on stage and I just

497
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,440
started bitching about I had to drive

498
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,280
and I just worked for these Hicks and

499
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,440
scream I can't smoke in

500
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,720
here I mean it was like and so this

501
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,760
voice starts laughing throughout the

502
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,159
whole show and it sounded like Mor and

503
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:35,480
I'm like is Mor here good this is what I

504
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:35,480
need it's some Los or Mor and it was him

505
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,640
okay so after the show he's like you are

506
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,400
so funny you're so funny and his manager

507
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,480
is also um the P person that produced

508
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,000
women of the night so they said we want

509
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,280
to put you on women of the night and

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,840
come down and blah blah blah so that's

511
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,400
how that came about so I mean you just

512
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,880
in the right place at the right time

513
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,960
luck luck luck total luck that's

514
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,280
beautiful that's beautiful which

515
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,360
probably L some of the other things

516
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,440
currently you live in New York City yes

517
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,919
how's the scene out there uh great I

518
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,039
really like it New York is very

519
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,480
different it's um it's it's like the

520
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:07,240
world's largest dumpster

521
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,240
but I like New York because it's a very

522
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,120
um you have to be on the ball to exist

523
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,480
there you cannot like kind of wander

524
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,240
around because you'll be killed you'll

525
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,600
be hit by a car or you'll be stabbed so

526
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,400
you have to have your senses about you

527
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,799
to live there okay and so you meet so

528
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,280
many people who are very interesting you

529
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,679
can walk to museums everybody's very

530
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,880
well read the audiences expect more of

531
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,120
you and so they push you MH if you don't

532
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
push yourself the audiences will push

533
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,120
you and that's really good that's great

534
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,799
that's great from my understand I talked

535
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,840

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,480
Anthony Benson anony Bon and he talked

537
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,000
about that with the planet I don't know

in front of people for going this is the

550
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,360
third week we're into now so it's been

551
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,760
constantly changing every show something

552
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,240

554
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,400

555
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,080

556
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,679
special or short film is kind of what

557
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,120
I'm gearing towards that I want to stay

558
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,039
in front of live audiences as much as I

559
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,360
can because I love just the response of

560
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,760
having people it gets them away from

561
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,559
their televisions at least you know

562
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,559
right right and you know how they feel

563
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,480
it doesn't matter what the critics say

564
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,760
it doesn't matter what anybody says

565
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,039
because you know what happened with

566
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,039
between you and the audience and that's

567
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,480
the nothing can top that feeling that's

568
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,960
fantastic and I would tell the viewers

569
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,240

570
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,400
