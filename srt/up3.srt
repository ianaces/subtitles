night I was driving home with a friend

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,640
uh from a show once we had a long

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,280
drive he wanted cocaine it's a long

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,960
drive I didn't blame him we were at a

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,320
gas station we didn't have any cocaine I

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,079
offered to uh buy him a Red Bull his

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,600
answer was it's not the [ __ ]

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,160
same which I don't know I think it might

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,799
be if you you realize that they cost the

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,280
same you know like uh you do $2.50 with

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,119
a cocaine it's probably not going to do

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,040
too much however you drink $50 with a

26
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,040
Red Bull it probably

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,240
work I don't know I uh I saw I worked at

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,320
a bar because um I don't know you need

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,880
life experience to tell these

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,640

just a little bit more humiliating just

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,200
hey all you dudes together right here in

68
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,080

ice in it it's

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
classy but I was standing at the Ural

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,879
trough of one of those clubs the other

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
day focusing on the task at hand and

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
this drunk stranger came in and he kind

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
of stumbled over next to me and he

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,920
unzipped and he slapped me on the back

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,440
which which is not the order to do that

77
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:12,000
in and he said to me hey man trust

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,040
me trust me don't [ __ ] in this bar

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,879
couple things sir first off if I'm

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,760
pooping in a bar it's probably not by

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,360
choice right think it's safe to say

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
something went horribly wrong today

83
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,680
neither you or I are really in control

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the situation here anymore second off

85
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,680
not how you start a conversation not at

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,599
all bad small talk right right off the

87
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,239
bat don't do that but I thought about it

88
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,040
for a while and I realized like the only

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,959
thing worse than going up to a complete

90
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,000
stranger and going hey man don't poop in

91
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,519
this bar would be going up to a complete

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,040
stranger and going hey man poop in this

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,760

that's the entire year right down the

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
middle but I had the worst bit of small

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
talk I've ever had the other day I was

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,400
at a buffet which is not specific to

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,240
that day and uh I like seconds it's cool

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,000
I was standing next to this lady I'd

120
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,400
never met before she had a sandwich on

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,840
her plate and at one point she leaned

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,840
over to go get more food and when she

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,320
did top half of her sandwich fell off

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,039
right onto the ground and that's sad

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
right yeah if you don't think about

126
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,360
anything else that's ever happened

127
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,960
that's sad sure but at that point in

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,039
time she and I had not interacted all

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,199
right she could have handled that the

130
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,800
way I would have handled it she could

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,160
have set her plate down she could have

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,479
gotten in her car she could have gone

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,600
home and just been ashamed forever like

134
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,720
an adult right instead she goes okay

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
great time to snag a co-starring role in

136
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,000
Robert phones' life I'm going to get a

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,840
little way in here on the sandwich

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,160
conundrum I'm having so she looked at me

139
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,759
and said oh my sandwich at which point I

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,120
said without thinking about it

141
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,319
impulsively well miss that's the good

142
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,360

she's like I really wanted to see a

365
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,440

368
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,240

00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,320
the Buffalo

370
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,480

that downtown and make a penguin show up

372

412
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,000

413
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:39,360
got a dog we got it from a breeder

414
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,040
people were mad at us they're like you

415
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,720

416
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,680
get a brand new one you should have got

417
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,920
a rescue one but like I understand where

418
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,600
they're coming from like I think it's

419
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,199
super nice to have rescue animals that's

420
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,959
a wonderful thing it's really important

421
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,920
everybody should do it like in fact I've

422
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,440
had rescue animals my whole life like

423
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,759
all those hamsters all 42 of them they

424
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,560

425
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,040

brand new one one time one that I can

428
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,279
mess up and somebody else can rescue it

429
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,000
later technically it is still a rescue

430
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,720

costume cuz that's

442
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,199
practical in case my dog was ever sworn

443
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,399
by bees throwing in that bee costume

444
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,160

costume and I was like well maybe we

452
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,160
should hold off on the bee costume until

453
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
she you know grows a little more cuz

454
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,319

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,240
one that she wants to wear we got boots

467
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,440
for the dog cuz we live in Minnesota so

468

we bought boots cuz there's snow

469
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,600
which was weird I didn't know dogs

470
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,160
needed boots cuz I watched a documentary

471
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,000
on wolves you guys none of them had

472
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,760

deer but we put we put the we got the

479
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,200
boots for the dog which was fun cuz it

480
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,240
only took about an hour and a half to

481
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,440
put the boots on

482
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,760
her which was weird it took so long cuz

483
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,039
it only took her a minute and a half to

484
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,840
shoot him off her feet right when she

485
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,520
got outside she's like I watched that

486
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,960
wolf documentary I'm not wearing

487
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,080
these got that my wife wanted to we were

488
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,559
going to my wife's cabin she wanted to

489
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,880
get a life jacket for the dog I was like

490
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,600
they have they have life jackets for

491
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,840
dogs I was like are we taking her deep

492
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,679
sea diving I thought we were just going

493
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,600
to the lake and she's like no she needs

494
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,440
a life jacket you know in case she falls

495
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,559
off the boat and I was like isn't there

496
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,679
a swim move named after

497
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,280
dogs isn't there like called the doggy

498
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,679
pal right I've heard of it I'm pretty

499
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,720
sure like I'm pretty sure you just put

500
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,200
the dog in the water and then it if it

501
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,720
doesn't swim then you just get a new dog

502
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,120
on the way home cuz that one wasn't

503
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,120
working

504
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,640
correctly but we got it it has a handle

505
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,200
we got the life Jack it's fun you can

506
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
dip it in the water and take it back out

507
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,000
and dip it back in take it back out and

508
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,799
it moves a pause the whole time it's

509
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
pretty fun the last thing we purchased

510
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,960
for our dog was

511
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,280
goggles yeah goggles those the real

512
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,080
thing they're called Goggles somebody's

513
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,720
making a lot of money out there selling

514
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,039
goggles for Animals calling them doggles

515
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,000
and I was like why does our dog need

516
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
goggles is she going Sky dabbing that's

517
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,520
the only reason unless we're going to

518
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
put her on a skateboard and she's going

519
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
to go super fast then we need to get

520
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,840
goggles those are the only two examples

521
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,480
I could ever think of my wife is like no

522
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,120
she needs the boss interior so she has

523
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,360
those bug eyes so she needs them for

524
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,559
protection in case she ever runs into a

525
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,720
door or gets sand in her eyes or maybe

526
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,960
another dog is beating her up for

527
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,360
wearing a life

528
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,799
jacket we got to get these goggles so I

529
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,559
was like all right get them I want to

530
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,320
see what this looks like just for fun so

531
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,120
we got the goggles and we put them on

532
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,080
the dog and they worked you guys they

533
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,360
really worked uh cuz she did not run

534
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,320
into any doors and she didn't get any

535
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,720
sand in her eyes and she also didn't

536
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,000
move for two

537
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,760
hours cuz she was terrified cuz she was

538
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,159
wearing goggles if you did that to a cat

539
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,320
it would murder

540
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,960
you he just like come on mittens get

541
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
your goggles on like slice you're right

542
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,679
this was a terrible idea I don't know

543
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,120
what I was

544
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,200
thinking Tommy you're a seasoned comic

545
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,240
what's the worst Road story you got like

546
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,400
the worst Heckle I've ever gotten I was

547
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,919
doing a show and I used to do this act

548
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,520
out where I would like get up on a stool

549
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,919
and be like now now now you can hear

550
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,880
that joke on my first album B time with

551
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,919
tmy r it's a bag of thumbs joke it's

552
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,400
really good but so it was this was like

553
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,000
a credit card swiper but I'd get up on

554
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,280
the stool and I was doing this big

555
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,919
elaborate act out and the audience

556
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,360
wasn't feeling it and they just got dead

557
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,960
quiet and then this lady like in the

558
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,520
Middle Road just goes why don't you go

559
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,400
back to Comedy

560
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,440
school and I had no I never really dealt

561
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,080
with like Heckler so I didn't know what

562
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,919
to do so I just slowly like climbed down

563
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,600
the stool and like now I've come up with

564
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,919
so many comebacks like I want her to

565
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,440
come back someday so I can Rec it why

566
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,679
don't you go back to that that school

567
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,080
where mean ladies go to be mean or you

568
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,080
probably graduated already cuz you're

569
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,559
really good at being me like I could

570
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,799
just really nail her with stuff like

571
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,799
that you really come a long

572
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,640
way but yeah I like being married my

573
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,919
wife she loves cuddling she loves

574
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,760
cuddling which is fun I like cuddling

575
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
she's like an aggressive cuddler like he

576
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,679
gets weird sometimes like I'm pretty

577
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,280
good at it I'm a bony like I show up

578
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,600
though you know put on a couple extra

579
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,360
two or three sweaters we're good to

580
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,679
go but she's really aggressive like I'll

581
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,240
come home she like you want to cuddle me

582
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,080
I'm like oh I'm not really feeling like

583
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,039
it right now she's like get her here now

584
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm like all

585
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,600
right I got some spooning in me let's do

586
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,039
this let's take care of business she

587
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,400
loves cuddling though I just wish there

588
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,840
was a place women could go sometimes to

589
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,480
get cuddling out their system so you can

590
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,919
get right to the good stuff I think that

591
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,520
would be nice like kind of like a strip

592
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,240
club but opposite you know just for

593
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,679
cuddling so women could pay like $20 and

594
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,320
some guy would just put his arm around

595
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,600
for like two songs right that'd be

596
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,640
great or here you go here you go pay $75

597
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,320
go upstairs to the real fancy room where

598
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,279
some guy will spoon you you can cry

599
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,159
about something

600
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,919
stupid yeah this a really good idea I'm

601
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,120
going to make

602
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,480
$1,000 my wife doesn't like that joke I

603
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,159
think it's a really good joke

604
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,400
it's called

605
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,600
cuddles your next cuddler just got off

606
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,799

607
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,120

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,120
chocolate come on it's only

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,760
$20 so Tommy such a fantastic year

610
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,840
you've been on television has that

611
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,600
affected you in any way uh the

612
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,360
television it it's been a great

613
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,799
experience my family finally like

614
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,880
respects what I'm doing cuz they've

615
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,679
always been wondering like where are you

616
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,279
going and like now there's proof like on

617
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,240
television they like oh that's what he

618
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,520
does we see it like my mom's always been

619
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
pretty supportive but she was like a

620
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,559
musician herself so she she was just

621
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,480
always amazed that people would put me

622
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,000
up in like a hotel cuz she was a f

623
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,720
musician I was like I think you chose

624
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,600
the least lucrative uh musician like

625
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,360
rock star you could be so that's the

626
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,520
purest art form but yeah it's been it's

627
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,279
been good my my wife is is proud of me

628
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,240
like she'll pick up all the when I call

629
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,760
her she always answers normally now

630
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,320
instead of like screening it like she

631
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,159
used to but so and then my my dog

632
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,640
respects he sits more often and like

633
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,559
yeah they just they bring me treats and

634
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,120
stuff so I feel like everybody's it's

635
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,840
been an overall positive experience from

636
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,840
everybody in my life what kind of treats

637
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,840
they bring you they're like uh like a

638
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,320
like a dead rat whatever dog would bring

639
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,679
you they bring me that it's a thought

640
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,080
that counts even if it's a dog thought

641
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,360
yeah Tommy Ryman ladies and gentlemen

642
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,360
when my wife and I first moved in

643
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,240
together she wanted a rat for a pet she

644
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,880
wanted a rat which I I didn't know

645
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,559
people had those for pets I thought they

646
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
just lived in sewers and hung out with

647
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,880
turtles but

648
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,799
she was like nope we we got to bring one

649
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,880
in and love it I was like okay I love my

650
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,960
wife so I was like if you want to get a

651
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,080
rat we can get a rat and so we went to

652
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
the Humane Society and we bought a rat

653
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,880
here's some advice if you're ever going

654
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,960
to do any Rat purchasing in your future

655
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,200
you definitely want to go new on the

656
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,600
rat this is the one time you can't go

657
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,600
rescue you got to go new pay the extra

658
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,799
$3 get a brand new rat cuz we bought a

659
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,679
used elderly senior citizen rat and rats

660
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,799
only Liv two to three years anyways so

661
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,039
this thing lived 3 months and it died it

662
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,080
died in my wife's hands like she was in

663
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,640
the living room I was in the kitchen

664
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,760
making grilled cheese having the time of

665
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,799
my

666
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,440
life when from the other room I just

667
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,679
heard deep sadness that I'd never heard

668
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,679
before like real guttural

669
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,279
like I was like she needs to go to

670
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,159
cuddles something's going on and I was

671
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,799
like maybe she's watching a sad movie or

672
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,919
something so I walked into the room and

673
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,080
she was just holding a dead rat in her

674
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,039
hands and I felt really bad cuz that was

675
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,480
her and her friend but at the same time

676
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,520
I was like we need to get that dead rat

677
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,679
out of your hands as soon as possible

678
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,880
cuz I'm pretty sure that's what took

679
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,320
Europe out I read about

680
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,159
that yeah that did not end well for them

681
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,640
and it should not be in our living room

682
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,640
so we took the rat and we put it in a

683
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
shoe box and double bagged it and some

684
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,679
Target bags to put on the deck I was

685
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,200
like what do you want to do with the rat

686
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
and she's like I would like to bury it

687
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,760
but it was February in Minnesota so I

688
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,240
was like have fun with that I was like

689
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,880
what are other options and she's like

690
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,559
maybe we could cremate the rat I was

691
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,919
like okay uh I've never done that I just

692
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,240
made the grilled cheese we could try

693
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,600
it and she was like no professionally I

694
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,760
was like that makes more sense that

695
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,520
makes way more sense we should pay

696
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,080
somebody to do this and we looked into

697
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,679
it there's places that are rack

698
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,520
cremation places I'm pretty sure they

699
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,679
same places that sell doggles

700
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
uh but we looked into it and it was

701
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,480
going to cost $100 to cremate the rat

702
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,200
which exceeded our rat cremation budget

703
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
by

704
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,480
$100 so we couldn't do that so we just

705
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,880
had a dead rat on our deck for a couple

706
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,360
days which was kind of like a visitation

707
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,120
for the neighborhood animals to say

708
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,360
their goodbye like the dogs and cats and

709
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,240
my wife came home and we're like we need

710
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,000
to figure out what we're going to do

711
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,880
with this guy so what we decided to do

712
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,039
was just drive around the city until we

713
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,520
found the most beautiful spot that had a

714
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,080
garbage

715
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,559
can and we we said some beautiful words

716
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,320
and we laid Lex Luther to rest so he was

717
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,120
by a really pretty Lake for at least a

718
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,039
day and then he was CED off to a giant

719
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,039
landfill and then we thought about it

720
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,720
like that's where he would have wanted

721
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:02,520
to be the whole damn time

722
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,520
it's rattle of
