00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,320
all this but I'm

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,000
single thank

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,560
you it's weird too like I was in an open

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,519
relationship and we broke up right and

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,279
like that's super awkward cuz when you

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,320
break up with an open

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,120
relationship it just feels like you got

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,559
into a more open

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,360
relationship it's like sit down honey I

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,360
think it's time we see even more other

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,760
people and the moment I became single

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,239
all my friends had all kinds of tips and

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,239
advice for me right and it's always the

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,719
people in the worst relationships that

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,960
have the most advice like I'm on the

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,480

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,119

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,200

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,000
the only joy I get out of dating is by

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,920
making the date as awkward for her as

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,480
