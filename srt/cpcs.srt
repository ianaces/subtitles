raised to be a

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,000
burger that is why that cow existed was

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,560
the need for

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,960
Burger I don't want a cow with hopes and

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,119

00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,439
here screaming from the cosmos was a

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,119
magical time I was just coming off Last

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,719
Comic Standing

34
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,880
which was probably one of the bigger

35
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,439
points of my career so it was definitely

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,479
you know screaming from the cosmos is

37
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,719
definitely an encapsulation

38
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,479
of you know that time period ax body

39
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,240
spray is a regression

40
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,680
as a society and everyone knows somebody

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,399
that uses it you do right before you

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,399
walked in here tonight they're like hold

43
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,110

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,920
jeans

63
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,920
um I just see a kid having a lot of fun

64
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,959
is what I see when I see screen I see a

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,040
guy that literally in the middle of a

66
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,720
giant cluster [ __ ] of success where he

67
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,480
didn't really know what was going on

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,519
kind of encapsulated a moment of it

69
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,760
sweet jacket though that was nice I

70
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
still

71
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,319
lost and alone's the new one uh it

72
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,159
was kind of my answer to ugly and angry

73
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,120
which was my album

74
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,000
previous

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,400
um you know it's just it's a weird

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
managerie of of jokes uh some really

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,959
funny stories in there and the great

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,640
thing about lost lost and alone is

79
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,200
there's you know a good chunk of it is

80
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,239
just happened at the show it's not even

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,400
really you know it's called the girl in

82
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,200
the cute noise and you know it's just

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,200
something that happened and then it was

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,799
magical enough that we kept it one take

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,959
one take one take Chris that's right man

86
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,959
oh man that's got to be a lot of

87
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,760
pressure though do I mean doing an album

88
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,320
like that cuz I mean I I would want like

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,840
10 takes of not screwing it up well you

90
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,919
know uh I don't you know I don't record

91
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,840

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,440
the time by the time I get to record an

93
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,680
album I'm so tired of that material

94
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,960
anyway it's almost like a giant goodbye

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,960
party and if you're going to bring up

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,280
politics at your friend's party you

97
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,320
should do everyone else at that party a

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,960
favor and instead of bringing up

99
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,759
politics just pull out your dick and

100
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,759
shove it in the

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,039
jello because you will get the same

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,600
reaction that you would have gotten had

103
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,240
you broughten up the election

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,199
