00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,840
month cut it out she goes what other

674
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,480
wife has to tell her husband to stop

675
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,840
[ __ ] dancing and I was like Mrs

Patrick

677
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,159
swayy you don't [ __ ] with this this [ __ ]

678
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,159
is

679
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,440
crazy we went on a vacation recently

680
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,440
where we went snorkling and she was like

681
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,919
let's go scuba diving I was like let's

682
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,159
not she's like why not I like I don't

683
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,240
think I should be in charge of my own

684
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,440
air that's

685
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,720
why and then she was like oh yeah that's

686
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
a good

687
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,880
idea I could do it but I shouldn't

688
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,440
because you have to mix your air and I

689
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,039
wouldn't have a chance like 5 seconds in

690
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,399
I'd be like too

691
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,760
much then your eye pops out of your head

692
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,919
and that would suck cuz a mask would

693
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,200
catch your eye and your other eye be

694
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,720
like what the [ __ ] is that my

695
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,200
eye I'm like holy crap that is my eye so

696
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,640
you go to take your mask off you get

697
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,440
your eye but the water swishes in it

698
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,200
sucks it out then a big sea leads it

699
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,320
right in front of you cuz he thinks it's

700
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,600
like a frozen snow PE he's like [ __ ]

701
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,679
dibs then you got to cut open his belly

702
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,200
and crawl in there but there's like an

703
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,840
old man with a puppet hanging out right

704
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,519
the puppet's like I want to be a boy

705
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,519

nice three CDs only

810
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:10,240

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,560
think you're probably a better driver

823
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,760
when you're 16 than when you get bad

824
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,079

tell you here's the deal because like I

848
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,040
wasn't thriving in the workplace before

849
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,560
like you've seen how I've stuck to

850
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,960
nothing like you've seen how I can't

851
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,200
focus on one little goddamn thing like I

852
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,599
used to get written up a lot that was

853
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,119
kind of like my thing at work that was

854
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,280
kind of like what I was known for have

855
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,599
to sign something at the end of a

856
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,720
meeting you ever have to do that at work

857
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,319
that's always fun my biggest regret is

858
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,839
all the bad jobs that I ever got fired

859
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:01,240
from my biggest regret is that I never

860
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,760
caused a scene and if you get fired

861
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,560
especially from a shitty job you should

862
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,920
go off right act like an idiot what do

863
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,920
you care Burger King doesn't talk to

864
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Wendy's so I have a plan if I ever have

865
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,440
to get another job and I know I'm going

866
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,680
to get fired that day that day I'm going

867
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,960
to go to work with like a pocket full of

868
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,640
glitter and when my boss fires me I'm

869
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,280
going to be like oh sorry it didn't work

870
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,160

1162
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,160
there I did an interview for a magazine

1163
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:47,280
about comedy at the end of the interview

1164
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,640
the guy asked me this he goes one more

1165
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,280
question goes how come black Comics are

1166
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,880
allowed to use the nword on stage but

1167
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,359
white Comics can and I was like probably

1168
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,920
cuz we haven't always used it properly

1169
00:49:54,359 --> 00:50:00,079
in the past

1170
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,079
we got a little bossy with

1171
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,040
it our N word privileges have been

1172
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,240
rebok I don't think we're getting him

1173
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,599
back

1174
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,200
either my grandpa thinks he's got him

1175
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,280
back

1176
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,520
already he sounds like Tupac in his

1177
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,920
house like I don't say the N word but I

1178
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,920
do sing it a lot cuz it's a lot of the

1179
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,839
cool music I like like you guys should

1180
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,359
hear me in my tourus with the windows up

1181
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:29,720
play to some weird moments though one

1182
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,559
time I had a black friend in my car and

1183
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,880
we're singing a Dre song together and

1184
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,400
all a sudden I realized that the N word

1185
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,559
was coming up and I was like holy [ __ ]

1186
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,559
yeah there's nothing in the album that

1187
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:40,559
tells you how to deal with that

1188
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,040
situation I was like man can I say it in

1189
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,200
front of him and I could see him looking

1190
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,200
at me too like what you going to do

1191
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:53,960
player so I just changed the word hoping

1192
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,040
he wouldn't notice I was like

1193
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,400
Gryffindor then I threw glitter in his

1194
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:01,720
