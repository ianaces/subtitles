41
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,200

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
doggy ate it daddy that doggy right

186
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,200
there and she's narking off the little

187
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,839
dog like he cannot disappear into the

188
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,440
crowd at this point there he is the

189
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,440
little [ __ ]

190
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,560
eater and I'm laughing so hard and I'm

191
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,640
thinking man like I love comedy I study

192
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,320
comedy I perform comedy every night I

193
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,600
will never be as funny as that little

194
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,079
dog like that dog has bested

195
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,640
me and now I'm laughing so hard that my

196
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,480
face is glowing red I've got tears

197
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,480
flowing down my

198
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,640
cheeks and at this point a woman nearby

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,120
decides that she doesn't approve of this

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,240
kind of fatherdaughter

201
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,160
bonding and she leans over to us and she

202
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,720
says um excuse me but

203
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,320
that's

204
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,920
disgusting and I said no no not really

205
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,440
cuz if you think about

206
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,000
it that little dog totally within the

207
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,000
5-second

208
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,160
rule then I thought man that was pretty

209
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,320
funny maybe I could open for that little

210
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,279
dog in

211
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,279
Vegas take our ax on the road

212
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,160
marijuana

213
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:10,320
huh yeah woo I don't I don't smoke it

214
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,720
myself uh and a lot of people don't

215
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,360
believe me when I say that they think

216
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm playing games they're like oh cuz

217
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,160
you eat it right uh no I just have

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,720
sensitive

219
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:26,600
eyes I just look like this and I'm often

220
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,800
hungry and a little bit

221
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,160
slow you guys smoke weed to get like me

222
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,680
is what I'm saying I'm already here but

223
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,959
I'm still totally in favor of legalizing

224
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,600
it yeah I feel very strongly about this

225
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,360
and I don't see why whether or not I

226
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,399
smoke it should have anything to do with

227
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,200
my attitude about legalizing it like

228
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,120
that seems ridiculous to me I get

229
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,639
frustrated when I talk to older people

230
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,079
and they're like well I don't smoke it I

231
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,959
don't see why anyone else needs to

232
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
either and I'm like yeah well you don't

233
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,639
listen to very good music or have sex

234
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,839
with Attractive people either old man

235
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,560
how about I [ __ ] decide for

236
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,079
me would that be all right and my thing

237
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,880
is I just don't see much of an argument

238
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,240
against it I see it as a fairly

239
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,040
innocuous drug uh and if you ask people

240
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,320
well what's wrong with it like they

241
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,519
still are throwing the same lamest thing

242
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
at you that they've been throwing around

243
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,079
since I was a kid it causes

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,920
paranoia that's the one like

245
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,399
psychological side effect they can throw

246
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,639
at you smoking marijuana causes

247
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,480
paranoia well [ __ ] I bet that one's true

248
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,120
I bet smoking pot does make you par

249
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,720
paranoid I have a little theory about it

250
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,360
though I think it might be because we

251
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,360
keep [ __ ] arresting people for

252
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,839
it does it seem like they could be

253
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,320
related I'm just saying legalize that

254
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,760
[ __ ] and that symptom might go

255
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,040
away I mean [ __ ] masturbation will make

256
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,720
you paranoid if you live with your

257
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,120
parents

258
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,480
sir I'm conflicted about the movement to

259
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,240
legalize it though like I'm glad I'm

260
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,279
glad and also surprised I'm I'm glad to

261
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,639
see it becoming legal in some states and

262
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,959
then just baffled that they're getting

263
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,040
to it before us like other states are

264
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:17,360
beating California at gay marriage and

265
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,040
legalizing weed who the [ __ ] are we now

266
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,560
like I thought that was our

267
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:28,160
[ __ ] how did we fall behind in gay and

268
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:30,600
weed like I thought we had that down

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,920
bat it's funny traveling the country CU

270
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,160
a lot of people think that weed's

271
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,959
already legal here they're like oh it's

272
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,920
pretty much legal in California and I'm

273
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,480
like no no it's not it's through these

274
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,720
dispensaries and you got to have a

275
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,800
legitimate medical issue like scoliosis

276
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,800
or cataracts or

277
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,680
freckles and I love the dispensaries I

278
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,920
have one right by my house I walk past

279
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,160
it every day and they're so funny

280
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,880
because they try to look like legitimate

281
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:05,440
pharmacies uh this one says all about

282
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,839
wellness and yeah they're nice people uh

283
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,320
but they have it they have it

284
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,880
written with the little American Medical

285
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,560
Association sign I'm like oh that's very

286
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,720
nice but they wrote it in that like

287
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Thrasher skater font with the lightning

288
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,279
and everything else like wait a minute

289
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,160
that doesn't say all about Wellness that

290
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:29,480
says all about

291
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,519
Wellness might as well add [ __ ]

292
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,240
I walk by at Christmas and they've got a

293
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,440
wreath on the door that's made out of

294
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,600
marijuana

295
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,040
leaves and I'm like hey you know what

296
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,639
other farmes don't treat their product

297
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,279
like that like I've never walked into

298
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,560
Safeway and heard oh you're standing

299
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,959

now I've been doing a lot of writing

302
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,519
lately I'm uh working on a country

303
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,440
western song I haven't gotten very far I

304
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,040

309
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,199

310
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,279
response uh don't worry about me I'll be

311
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,120
okay appreciate it I just think it's

312
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,880
underappreciated art form thought I'd

313
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,880
take a stab at

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,759
it I uh I've come up with one I really

315
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:35,800
like it's uh goodby why you can have my

316
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,800
records but I'm taking all my

317
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,880
pills

318
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,120
kisses I do I do get a little depressed

319
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,440
sometimes I got depressed buying life

320
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,000
insurance I'm a father now I got to have

321
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,079
life insurance it's a responsible thing

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,800
to do but it's depressing being

323
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,880
workingclass poor and then having this

324
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,759
like million-dollar policy when your

325
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,920
three and a half-year-old says to you

326
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,959
Daddy I hope you never die

327
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,959
your first thought shouldn't be ah you

328
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,560
sure cuz you know you could go to

329
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,440
college I want to talk to you guys about

330
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,920
this uh this tattoo that's been going

331
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,600
around on the internet I don't know if

332
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,360
you guys have seen it but this dude

333
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,360
decided to get this tattoo on his bicep

334
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:27,240
that says Thou shalt not lie with a

335
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,600
man as one lies with a woman it is an

336
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,199
Abomination which I think means snowman

337
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,240
really dig

338
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,480
it I don't know I didn't finish High

339
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,720
School uh under that is the attribution

340
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,680
Leviticus this comes out of

341
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,199
Leviticus that's important because this

342
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,000
dude was so excited when he found that

343
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,720
quote To Get Inked Up on his arm that he

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,279
didn't even flip the page CU on the next

345
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,759
page of Leviticus it says don't get a

346
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,920
tattoo you

347
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,079
douchebag I'm paraphrasing but that

348
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,519
shit's in there you can look it up but

349
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,120
what's really funny about it to me is

350
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,399
just the wording Thou shalt not lie with

351
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,199
a man as one lies with a woman I don't

352
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,399
think that says don't be gay that's just

353
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:12,920
advice on positions isn't

354
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,040
it good advice the Bible's like oh you

355
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,560
know you [ __ ] the lady you probably

356
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,880
want to try [ __ ] a dude sometime why

357
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,600
wouldn't you uh but listen listen we

358
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,560
made the anatomy a little bit different

359
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,120
adjust the Bible's trying to help you

360
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,839
out it's like don't just jump right into

361
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,480
missionary position you will end up

362
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:37,279
frustrated and possibly even injured you

363
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,279
got to get the legs up a little higher

364
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,079
uh sorry I didn't mean to get too

366
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,440

the time going uh dude we can do

368
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,120

so I put that in the joke but uh

372
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,360
obviously that's not how this guy meant

373
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,480
it I mean this guy had a chance to say

374
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,399
something from inside himself and to

375
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,120
externalize it to put it on himself in a

376
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,640
way that's permanent given his religious

377
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,760
beliefs probably something he even

378
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,919
thinks he's going to take with him to

379
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,400
the next life and what did he have to

380
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,880
express from the depths of his soul what

381
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,559
was the sentiment that he had to share

382
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,000

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,039

perplexing type of

interracial

668
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,639
Bliss president

obesy got two

670
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,519
terms who thought and I think it's time

671
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,519
we change the name of the White

672
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:58,080
House that's right the streak is over

673
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,120
now I'm not suggesting we call it the

674
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,120
Chocolate

675
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,039

676
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,519

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,200
punch he got a little bit of everything

679
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,799
in so the name should reflect his

680
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,159
multiracial ethet

681
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:26,799
background so that's why I'm proposing

682
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,799
we call it the halfway house

683
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,919
he may get commemorated on some money

684
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,080

00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:46,039

representative cuz the penny has a

693
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,480
parallel existence to African Americans

694
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:12,000

695
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,240

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,879
chocolate moving out the dark element

724
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,879
for the safe lighter and

725
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,359
whiter

726
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,079
chocolate how can chocolate be white and

727
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,079

728
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,720
sense making everything white white

activity

very

749
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,599
controversial recently had uh Paula Dean

00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,599
a time to lie that was

753
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:03,000

you say it and who says it right you can

760
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,599
say [ __ ] but you can't say [ __ ] and I

761
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,400
ain't never understood that

762
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,640
science it's very impractical if you ask

763
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,920
me like if I'm hanging out somewhere and

764
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,240
all of a sudden I hear somebody go get

765
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,680
that [ __ ]

766
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,359
at that moment I ain't thinking about

767
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,800
who said it I ain't thinking about how

768
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,760
they said it I'm just thinking I want to

769
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,760
be the [ __ ] they about to

770
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,160
get so I'm a moon walk out of that

771
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,560
situation I ain't going to take off my

772
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,560
ipod like hey can you repeat

773
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,480
that I need to check the

774
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,520
phonetics black people for years have

775
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,839
tried to count punch the N

776
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,319
word calling white people

777
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:06,680
crackers and you can't assault somebody

778
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,119
with a snack

779
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,240
term that [ __ ] just rolls off white

780
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,359
people

781
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,440
back epic fail black

782
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,359
people try harder next

783
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,359
time sugar cookie

784
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,359
sorry that's like somebody calling me a

785
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,200
Kit Kat how mad am I going for [ __ ]

786
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:33,880
big why yes I am sweet and crispy I

787
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,880
appreciate

788
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,000
that I do a lot of jokes about race but

789
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,800
it's just to make fun of the absurdity

790
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,240
of it all that we treat each other

791
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,520
different on on color you know as just

792
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,200
ridiculous cuz I can never judge someone

793
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,880
by the color of their skin that's stupid

794
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,520
instead I choose to judge someone by the

795
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,599
color of their

796
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,680
teeth cuz that's when [ __ ] color

797
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:00,640
matters if it ain't white it ain't right

798
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,680
white power for

799
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:08,800
real [ __ ] orange and green and

800
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:11,240
yellow purple hearts blue

801
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,480
moons I've been thinking about starting

802
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,079

809
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,599

that stuff cuz it's

856
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,920
embarrassing but eventually I bolster up

857
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,200
my nerve and I cross the park to little

858
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,960
corner store by our house where I can

859
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,880
buy that stuff and as I'm approaching

860
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,240
the door I'm saying cute girls don't be

861
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,560
here cute girls don't be here cuz

862
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,839
there's three really cute girls that

863
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,280
work there and I didn't want to buy

864
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,440
feminine hygiene products from those

865
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,359
cute girls and I get to the door and I

866
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,280
hear Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden

867
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,200
blasting and I go yes cuz that meant

868
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,760
that heavy metal guy was there alone

869
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,280
that day and I open the door and I go

870
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,000
over and I get her the stuff that she

871
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,319
asked for and then I also I guess as

872
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,599
camouflage grabbed a candy bar and a

873
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:29,240
coke that I didn't even want thinking

874
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,160
[ __ ] he'll never notice him sandwich

875
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,520
between these sugary

876
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,280
treats and I go up and I set it all on

877
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,119
the counter and dude Rings it up but he

878
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,280
doesn't even give a [ __ ] he just knocks

879
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,280
it all into the little bag and tells me

880
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,560
how much money I owe him and I thought

881
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,480
oh great this is perfect thank you heavy

882
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,040
metal dude and I pay him and he doesn't

883
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,520
say a word to me until I'm walking out

884
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,119
the door at which point he says so you

885
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,119
bleeding

886
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,319
Keith to which I would replied like a

887
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,839
stuck pig I am and I ran

888
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,599
home where my wife saw the chocolate bar

889
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:06,800
in the Coke and thought you really do

890
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,800
get

891
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,760
it and she loves

892
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,240
me my dad was really bad at talking to

893
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,920
us about sex he just was terrible at it

894
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,800
and one day me and my little brother

895
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,400
were in the house alone with my dad and

896
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,640
my little brother comes walking out with

897
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,680
a box of maxi pads and he says hey Dad

898
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,319

was satisfied I was like all right dodge

904
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,000
a bullet this time and then he goes out

905
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:49,359
to skateboard and I guess he ate

906
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,839
[ __ ] cuz I see him leaving again a few

907
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,760
minutes later with the board under his

908
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:56,599
arm only now he's got maxi pads stuck

909
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,440

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,800
I met uh I met Keith uh when I sold him

931
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,400
some

932
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,640
tampons and no I'm not heavy metal guy

933
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:12,079
all right didn't dress the part hi I uh

934
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,839
I flew up here for this everybody yeah

935
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:17,319
right put an effort I uh at the airport

936
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,000
in La they pulled me aside and they

937
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:21,720
peeled apart my luggage in front of

938
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,200
everybody didn't like it I think if they

939
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,480
peel apart your [ __ ] and they don't find

940
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,880
anything you should win a

941
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,359
prize right you should get to claim

942
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,920
something that was confiscated from

943
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,640
somebody

944
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,640
else they're not smoking

945
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,760
it I think that they should put a bucket

946
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,920
outside airport security so when you're

947
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,920
going to go through and you don't want

948
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,319
to throw away your perfectly good uh

949
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,480
lighter or bottle of water or shaving

950
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,280
cream or shampoo you can put it in the

951
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,319
bucket and then when somebody coming off

952
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,359
of one of the planes needs a lighter or

953
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:56,160
bottle of water some shaving cream it's

954
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:59,240
free in the bucket it's a good idea huh

955
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,000
yeah uh that would cost nothing I'll buy

956
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,079
the

957
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
bucket I also think they should put a

958
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:06,440
doctor next to the X-ray machine so when

959
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,280
you go through he can tell you if you

960
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,119
have

961
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,960
tumors you know what I mean as long as

962
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,760

thick I know the obvious stuff right I

1076
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
know George Washington invented the $1

1077
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:55,040
bail and then uh Ben Franklin tied a key

1078
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,040
to a kite and freed the slaves with it

1079
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,599
and then we got into a World War to save

1080
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:05,880
Private

1085
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,359

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,559
tape I don't know why they're using

1087
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:28,559
muskets if they had cameras that good

1088
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,520
it's hard to watch TV when you live in

1089
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:42,559
LA CU you you get jealous of the people

1090
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,480
on TV you get mad at them so now I tend

1091
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:48,160
to watch shows where I'm not jealous of

1092
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:50,119
the stars of the show like

1093
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,000
hoarders you guys watch

1094
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:56,960
hoarders I love hoarders hoarders makes

1095
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,839
me feel like I got my life together

1096
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,839
I can walk through my

1097
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,119

to quit her job and start a

1277
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:55,319
band baby

1278
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,160
ah sometimes I think of jokes there

1279
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:07,799
aren't as much jokes per se as they are

1280
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,359
theories that I have about some [ __ ]

1281
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:13,359
just uh just some truth I think I

1282
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:15,760
discovered and uh let's do some of

1283
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,960
those I think that the drunkness that I

1284
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,440
experience from alcohol or the high that

1285
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:24,680
marijuana creates is actually the spirit

1286
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,920
form of my brain cells dying and going

1287
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,920
to heaven

1288
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:35,520
Che on

1289
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:37,680
it I think seedless watermelons don't

1290
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,920
taste as good because they got no reason

1291
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,920
to

1292
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:52,280
live I think if video cameras recorded

1293
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:52,280
smell porn would not be as popular

1294
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:04,400
I think based on how they kiss Eskimo

1295
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,400
[ __ ] must be terrible

1296
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,760
one way to describe the other night is I

1297
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,119
had a

1298
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:36,960
threesome another way to describe that

1299
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,960
night is I jerked off in front of two

1300
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:41,119
mirrors

1301
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,760
framing if you see a guy smelling his

1302
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:52,520
finger he looks like a loser right but

1303
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,960
if he's smelling two fingers he kind of

1304
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,960
looks like a winner

1305
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,240
saying all right this one this one's

1306
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,720
kind of

1307
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:19,200
heavy I think that your personality was

1308
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:21,480
created by how good the sex that made

1309
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,079
you

1310
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:26,760
was some heavy [ __ ]

1311
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,880
right like if you're fun cool outgoing

1312
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,319
kind of person it's cuz the sex that

1313
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,480
made you was fun and cool and

1314
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:37,319
outgoing and if you're an [ __ ] it's

1315
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,319
cuz you're mom wasn't awake

1316
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,520
I like it when athletes make bad

1317
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:04,279
decisions cuz it makes me feel like they

1318
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:06,480
don't have the whole world figured out

1319
01:04:04,279 --> 01:04:08,200
you know makes me feel better by myself

1320
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,640
when when uh people who are perfect

1321
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:12,880
screw

1322
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:16,039
up like um uh you know that like certain

1323
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,559
ones I can understand certain ones like

1324
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:21,000
um like uh Tiger Woods I'm not mad at

1325
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,279
Tiger I mean he told his wife he was

1326
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,720
going out for 18

1327
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:27,720
holes all right let's edit that one out

1328
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,799
I'm not mad you know who my favorite my

1329
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,599
favorite athlete screw up is is um is

1330
01:04:33,799 --> 01:04:36,839
Michael

1331
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:40,079
Phelps I love Michael Phelps he's my

1332
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:42,680
favorite because he's a stoner and a

1333
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,720
champion you feel

1334
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:48,760
me I I was mad at Michael Phelps when he

1335
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:50,240
apologized for smoking that weed if

1336
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,920
anybody could have gotten away with it

1337
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:55,279
it's the dude who just won more gold

1338
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,400
medals than anybody ever right I think

1339
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:58,400
he earned himself a bong

1340
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,400
hit if he would have just stood up for

1341
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:05,640
himself he could have proved that weed

1342
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,079
ain't so bad yeah he could have proved

1343
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,599
that weed doesn't stand between you and

1344
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:11,440
more gold medals than anyone

1345
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,799

I want to make an alarm clock that

1397
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:53,680
instead of waking you up with a sound it

1398
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:56,880
wakes you up with the smell of bacon

1399
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,480
cooking right how great would that be

1400
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,000
6:00 a.m. instead

1401
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:03,520

1403
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,559
ban it's a better way to wake up and

1404
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,760
just in case the bacon would work its

1405
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,319
way into your dream you ever do that

1406
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,920
instead of waking up to the song on the

1407
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:18,880
radio you just start dancing to it in

1408
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:20,880
your dream and then you sleep through

1409
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,560
work right so just in case you just

1410
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:27,440
dream you're eating a big pile of bacon

1411
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,440
the next smell after the snooze is [ __ ]

1412
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,640

1413
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:33,400

published a study a little while ago

1548
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:07,639
marijuana alleviates the symptoms and

1549
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:10,480
the onset of Alzheimer's disease it's

1550
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:12,639
true how it works is you get so used to

1551
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:15,560
forgetting

1552
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:17,719
[ __ ] you develop a

1553
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,920
system right then the Alzheimer's kicks

1554
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,920

01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,800
random middle-aged white dude one time

1764
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,600
down in Sacramento down in El Grove and

1765
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,040
uh round around the third hole time to

1766
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,600
dial the swing in a little bit right so

1767
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,080
I pulled out a fat hoop took a couple

1768
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,199

crack

1772
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:06,840
no and might I answer I find your

1773
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,840
presumptuousness somewhat

1774
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,840
off-putting and secondly who the [ __ ]

1775
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:17,480
smokes crack on the golf course what the

1776
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:17,480
[ __ ] that doesn't help your swing

1777
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:31,480
right drug for the right activity that's

1778
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,280
my point weed and golf makes sense booze

1779
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:35,960
and golf make a little bit of sense

1780
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,239
crack and golf don't make a liquor sense

1781
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,480
right you don't do crank and go to the

1782
01:23:37,239 --> 01:23:39,480
chess

1783
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,560
tournament you don't eat a bunch of

1784
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:47,199

1789
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:04,679

1790
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,120

1794
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:16,760
uh that's how mushrooms

1795
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:18,239

1799
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:27,719
America

1800
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,400
couple years ago uh Damon sire former

1801
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:31,280
point guard for the Spurs for the

1802
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,840
Trailblazers University of Arizona

1803
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,400
Wildcats point guard by the way I found

1804
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,920
that ironic because we smoked a joint

1805
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,920
and he didn't pass it one [ __ ]

1806
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:44,000
time right the point guard supposed to

1807
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,440
think pass first you feel me right we

1808
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,080
had to put a full court press on his ass

1809
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,280
and force a turnover I locked him

1810
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,679
down he got arrested at Tucson

glad that you asked me because we you've

1865
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:59,639
been friends for a while and uh I think

you've earned it um it's very simple

1867
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:06,480
very easy easy to make the first

1868
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,920
ingredient as always is love and I know

1869
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,600
that sounds corny man but I think it

1870
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,400
needs to be said because people always

1871
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,679
forget to put it in there right so it's

1872
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:17,840
love and then it's two cups of apples I

1873
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:20,159
recommend a cross between a pink lady

1874
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,600
and a Fuji Fuji's a Japanese Apple you

1875
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:24,239

1876
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,360
kazakistan and they came all the way

1877
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,840
around the world and there's so many

1878
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,000
different varieties now so it's a cross

1879
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,199

1880
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,040
