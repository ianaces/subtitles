if it's not throw Cleveland in there so

220
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,759
I'm assuming at the time you were making

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,520
some big bank then well I was 24 years

222
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,199
old and uh I don't know $50,000 a year

223
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,560
on my way to make a lot is that a lot of

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,360
money I don't know but it was good I

225
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,360
know it was good why did you decide to

226
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,759
pursue a career in standup comedy oh I

227
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,199
wanted to be a comedian since I was 6

228
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,879
years old I'm in the business because of

229
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,120
Red Skelton okay Milton Barrow uh and

230
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,879
also uh some other names too some Comics

231
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,400
don't know moms mayy oh yes judge P me

232
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,000
Richard PR you know I know they all know

233
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,760
Richard PR but that's why I'm in the

234
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,640
business yes Danny K even was funny to

235
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,200
me when I was a kid yeah so uh that's

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,519
why I'm in the business so even when

237
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,039
you're doing other stuff your goal was

238
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,560
always to be a stand up comedian always

239
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,080
since I was 6 years old I wanted to get

240
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,240
a financial cion because I heard these

241
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,040
other older comedians saying that how

242
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,880
tough it was and I think it was tough in

243
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,399
their day and now it's gotten tough

244
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,160
again right now for some young Comics

245
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,040
starting but I wanted to get a few

246
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,480
degrees I got three degrees and I wanted

247
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,560
to make a lot of money get myself a

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,600
financial cushion and I saved up what

249
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,680
$300 or $400 I said that's

250
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,200
enough then I moved to Los Angeles and

251
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,360
immediately I started uh when I quit

252
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,720
advertising I wrote the red fox show for

253
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,720
a year and then I started doing my own

254
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,279

this a little bit because I really do

350
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,839

359
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,560

don't know why but it slows you down so

372
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,800
maybe you got to turn off make a det2 or

373
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,839

374
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,279

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,440
through hardship out there and and life

379
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,079

them they can't pay the rent how did

381
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,600

383
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,240
them well I'm saying all of those are

384
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,120
roadblocks and uh and and life nobody

385
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,519

386
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,680
and these things are part of life you

387
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,880

396
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,800
taught me that I got to continue living

397
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,800

476
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,360
I'm telling you I'm a little upset today

477
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,759
you are because your name is not in

478
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,480
Minneapolis St Paul can you believe that

479
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,480
I know it's unbelievable and the people

480
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,880
that they pick to be sexy it sounds like

481
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,000
it's their friends and the friends that

482
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,120
they'd like to have I know that's right

483
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
and I think everyone out there want to

484
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
be my friend yeah Brit here is a staff

485
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,480
writer and uh Claude is a managing

486
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,040
editor and it looks like it's just their

487
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,600
list because it says our first ever

488
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,199
selection so it doesn't really mean that

489
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,000
it's a true representative it's just

490
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,480
these two people that don't know anybody

491
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,120
that's my first demand I want an apology

492
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
for both these writers the editor and

493
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,280
the publisher of the magazine I think

495
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,679

that's coming out that's very popular in

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,159
the community now my opinion on De

648
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,320
Comedy Jam is that there's a market for

649
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,039
everything I'm out of the marketing

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,200

651
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,679

652
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,120
are people that enjoy this show I enjoy
