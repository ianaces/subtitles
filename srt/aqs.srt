12 minutes with you lovely people

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,760
tonight quite frankly

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,000
so I met this guy

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
Stephen and I was like oh it's great to

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,640
meet you

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,440
Stephen so Stephen you ever just wake up

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,440
and wonder what's the

18
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:52,359
point you ever get anxiety

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,960
Stephen you ever worry that maybe

20
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,640
someday your anxiety is going to become

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,399
so powerful that it's going to manifest

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,760
itself in some extreme metaphysical

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,320
event like it's going to transport you

24
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,559
to the bottom of the deepest in the

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,079
middle of the ocean and you're going to

26
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,479
realize what's happening for a split

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,920
second before you're crushed by the

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,479
pressure in the Darkness at the bottom

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,640
of the

30
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,520
ocean that ever happen to you

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,880
Stephen you ever worry that maybe

32
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,439
someday your anxiety is going to become

33
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,280
so strong that it'll teleport you to the

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,000
dwarf planet formerly known as Pluto and

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,280
you look out at our galaxy unfolding in

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,920
front of you you'll see our sun just a

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,759
blue Speck in the distance as your blood

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,079
vessels freeze and your lungs collapse

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,240
and you're crushed by the pressure in

40
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,880
the darkness in the vacuum of space you

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,479
can relate to that right stepen

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,799
it's just regular human [ __ ] you

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,159
know you ever worry that maybe someday

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
you're going to wake up but instead of

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,759
being your bed you're going to be in a

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,320
tiny hole in the center of the earth and

47
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,520
it's pitch black and 150° you can just

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,159
barely squirm for an inch before you

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,520
feel a Tremor and you're crushed by the

50
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,560
pressure in the darkness in the center

51
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,799
of the

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,560
earth only instead of like I don't

53
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,560

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,920
