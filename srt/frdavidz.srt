you've been producer man some great

211
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,120
great success what something I never

212
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,960
understood what exactly does a producer

213
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,440
do uh producer is different with

214
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,319
everybody I think I mean there's some

215
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,680
producers that are writers and there's

216
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,080
some producers that are puers and

217
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,720
they're you know players and uh some

218
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,159
people just hold people's hands and some

219
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
people just say that's the good one uh

220
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,720
it's kind of different with everybody

221
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,120
really yeah so it's a unique sort of

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,560
just like get guitar players not you

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
know it's all different every person's a

224
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,440
different personality how dides someone

225
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,479
become a producer how did you get into

226
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,479
the producing game uh it was an accident

227
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,399
with me I uh I didn't want to do it I uh

228
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
it was a mistake I was a shoe salesman

229
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,640
and my wife said want you to do

230
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,320
something interesting so I started to be

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
record producer really yeah that's all

232
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,920
happened that's all happened huh that's

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
same thing with me something like that

234
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,480
happened to me I was working at the

235
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,480
fantasy house oh shut up now am

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,200
man please now but so you got on to now

237
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,959
you first the old Prince get his record

238
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:09,480
deal back in 7877 well yeah I mean uh uh

239
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,120
we did a demo tape and on the basis of

240
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,680
that Warren brothers signed him they I

241
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,240
remember they took him out to LA and we

242
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,000
went out there and they didn't believe

243
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,399
that he played everything I guess they

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,440
wanted to see it for themselves so he

245
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,880
kind of did an audition and they had all

246
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,760
these five or six producers there from

247
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Warner Brothers ass sciti you know which

248
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,600
one which one's going to do it and they

249
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,680
like man he can do it himself we don't

250
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,079
need that so he's a great talent of

251
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,279
course you see him grow over the years

252
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:36,399
oh yeah I ask you a quick question we're

253
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,519
going to get on to but when you think

254
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,560
about the remember you saw the article

255
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,360
on the City Pages about how he's changed

256
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,160
since the great success has happened

257
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
he's CH no he hasn't changed at all you

258
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,600
don't you don't agree with that argument

259
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,120
that he's he's living in this Castle or

260
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,839
this isolation Elvis thing I don't think

261
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,920
he's changed since I've since the

262
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,760
beginning you know I don't know about

263
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,640
living in isolation if he is then he

264
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,760
always has okay but I don't think he's

265
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,720
changed okay the same person now you

266
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,959
work with so people we saw the Fine

267
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,320
Young Cannibals uh Jesse Johnson yeah

268
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,720
all these different artists who did you

269
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,160
enjoy working with the most oh there's a

270
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,560
there's a few that I really like Prince

271
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,040
Of course I love the he was he's fun all

272
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,000
the time find young cannibals are fun I

273
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,519
mean most most people I work with I do

274
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,160
it cuz I I know I'm going to have fun

275
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,440
with them that's the reason I do it to

276
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,880
have fun when you having fun like when

277
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,120
you produce a record you look at it's on

278
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,800
tape do you know it's going to be hit no

279
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,760
you know it's good you do it for what's

280
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,240
what you love and you hope it's going to

281
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,560
be a hit but you never know it's all

282
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,000
kind of in the air sometimes really like

283
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,000
like when you did funky town which was

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
how I mean we're talking millions of an

285
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
international smash that was really

286
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
illogical because there was no hit out

287
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,399
of Minneapolis ever before that except

288
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,920
for maybe you know a different era but

289
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,639
you know we we always hoped that we

290
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,920
could make hit records in Minneapolis

291
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,160
and um when that one that one was the

292
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,040
first one really that was such a big hit

293
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,040
and it just shocked me I had no idea I

294
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,880
didn't even know it was a hit until a

295
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,120
year later because we never even heard

296
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,320
it on the radio here right because mini

297
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,440
off isn't Progressive well yeah it was

298
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,760
kind of stifled and I think that's kind

299
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,399
of probably the reason that uh the music

300
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,120
scene flourished here is because one of

301
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,600
the reasons is that we didn't get to

302
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,200
hear all this stuff on the radio so we

303
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,880
got frustrated and started making our

304
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,000
own music it's kind of what happened now

305
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,399
that you have influence how come we're

306
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
not getting low even now it's still

307
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,839
tough for new artists get stuff on the

308
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,560
radio here in the Twin Cities H I don't

309
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,000
know I it's programmers you know mhm

310
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,639
it's it's what they think the people

311
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,560
will like and and they look at the

312
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,279
demographics and say well there's only

313
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,800
2% of these kind of people so we don't

314
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,680
need to play that kind of music and that

315
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,880
you know might they're discounting the

316
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,320
fact that maybe everybody likes a little

317
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,440
everything MH you know in Europe it's

318
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,160
different cuz they they just play good

319
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,519
music they'll play a good country song

320
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,480
they'll play a good R&D song they'll

321
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,000
play a good rap song you know just back

322
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,440
to back just because it's good not

323
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,720
because it's a certain style so I think

324
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,360
that's kind of healthy mhm the L more

325
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,839
diversity yeah and here things like like

326
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,079
you know it's an R&B station or it's a

327
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,240
pop station it's a country station

328
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,200
everybody's in a slot right yeah that's

329
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,279
not very fair yeah that's true that's

330
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,079
true we now talk about the uh the Fine

331
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,279
Young Cannibals that was a tremendous

332
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,920
hit she drives me crazy I heard it had a

333
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,639
different title initially yeah it was uh

334
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,920
she's my baby she's my baby mhm who

335
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,560
changed it you changed it no they

336
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,959
changed it they changed yeah they did

337
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,279
they wanted something a little catchier

338
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,560
uhhuh some somebody could identify with

339
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
and I think we all have people that

340
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,240
drive us

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,720
crazy so uh you know and female people

342
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,720
too so uh that applied everybody

343
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,720
understood so I think it worked so when

344
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,279
you made that song you had like no

345
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,360
inclination this is this this really has

346
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,040
that touch well actually they were they

347
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,760
threw it away they didn't want to do it

348
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,800
really when they sent me all the songs

349
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,279
um I said well I'll do that song but I

350
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,560
don't to do the other ones because they

351
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,360
weren't ready and they went well that

352
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
one we didn't want to do that one I went

353
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,800
oh man that's the only one I like right

354
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,320
now but you know all the other ones

355
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,360
developed as we you know did the record

356
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,279
but I kind of pull that one over the

357
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
trash can which is kind of interesting

358
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,040
mhm I don't think artists know what

359
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,600
sometimes what songs they write they

360
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,760
write so many songs that they don't know

361
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,760
which ones are the good ones sometimes

362
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,160
they're too close to it mhm so I think

363
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,240
that's one thing a producer should do is

364
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,519
be able to pick the the hit so if I'm an

365
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,600
artist not coming to you I got to trust

366
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,720
your judgment on what's good and what's

367
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,079
not good you you decide yep and you're

368
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,839
the boss huh how in fact you've worked

369
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,279
with something I want to ask you about

370
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,079
is do you ever see artists like from the

371
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,560
old days say like James Brown and say or

372
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,959
Al Green or something if I could take

373
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,199
him out and put some Modern beats on it

374
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,880
and and uh and do something with him you

375
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,120
yeah I do that's that would be really

376
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,880
fun to do sometimes um uh I'd like to

377
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,760
experiment with that but it's hard to

378
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,839
get to people once they' been

379
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,320
established for so long and you know

380
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,440
they don't want to change I I've done a

381
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,320
couple experiments kind of like a mad

382
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,800
scientist where I took uh some

383
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,680
established artists and they wanted

384
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,040
something new but yet when it came down

385
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,759
to it they they have a hard time going

386
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,399
well that's not the way we always did it

387
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,160
so you know we can't do it that way so

388
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,920
it's a little harder I like new artists

389
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,920
because they'll Bend you know they'll do

390
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,440
anything I say if I say put the guitars

391
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,920
underwater and play a solo and they

392
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
won't go watch they'll they'll go won't

393
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,560
I be electrocuted I say no don't trust

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,880
me so it'll work and that kind of stuff

395
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,560
you know they'll believe me and and I

396
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
like that cuz it works sometimes what's

397
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,920
your proudest moment as a producer what

398
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,759
out of all the stuff you work on what

399
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,360
are you most proud of oh I don't know

400
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,839

know I I guess I'm proba I'm proud

405
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,839
actually of a lot of the things that

406
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,639
didn't sell because I do it because I

407
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,920
believe in it and there's some groups

408
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,800
and artist that you know maybe didn't

409
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,079
get so big as far as sales but I still

410
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,759
think they're great musicians great

411
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,720
songwriters I was thought there's so

412
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,759
many people maybe in their basement that

413
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,519
have as much talent as the people on top

414
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,600
but they might never get a chance to see

415
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,880
it you we got to wrap up here real quick

416
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,560
speaking to people in the basement what

417
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,040
advice would you give someone who wants

418
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,000
to go on and be successful producing

419
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,000
that's it really punch what if someone

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,160
want that says uh I'm I'm bad and I want

421
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,600
