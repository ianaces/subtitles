00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,360
in order to make a tire change as

66
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,959

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,199
is an 1860 Army Colt they consider this

112
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,919
the pistol that won the West first of

113
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,840
all to load it you have to put it on

114
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,000
half Dock and pour each cylinder with 30

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,160
grains of powder

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,560
then you put a lead ball on it and smash

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,680
the lead ball down

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,560
inside then you have to put a little bit

119
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,560
of grease on each cylinder so it doesn't

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,240
chain fire a chain fire is when they all

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,759
go off at once and that's a lot of fun

122
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,600
if you know what I mean then you put a

123
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,919
cap over each one of these little holes

124
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,479
down here and when you pull the hammer

125
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,680
