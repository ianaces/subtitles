specifically you are actually here you

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,879
just sound very strange in person this

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,920
is um so normally obviously we start off

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,440
you know I give a year I give an album I

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,000
give an artist um I wanted to just talk

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,879
with you about your influences and also

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,280
I mean here's the thing you've been

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,559
involved with so many of the albums

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,480
we've talked about on the show already

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,960
uh any of these that you want that you

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
you're up for talking about I'd love to

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,359
talk to you about too well um the only

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,680
one that I I mean I I've played with a

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,479
bunch of people but the the one that I

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,600
can talk about with some knowledge is

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,320
the uh one that I had most to do with

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,040
which is a great gift idea the the one

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,119
credibility gap album that I thought

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,520
really represented uh that group at its

28
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:22,360
best um but the you you also asked me to

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,759
talk about uh if I if I had an album or

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,640
two that had influenced me yes and uh

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,560
the answer to that is a definite neon uh

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,320
capital letter yes uh specifically Stan

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,159
freeberg presents the United States of

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,479
America oh good good uh that is it is

35
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,000
easily one of my favorites that we've

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,280
been introduced to that I've been

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,439
introduced to through the show uh you

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,920
know I had a collection before we

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,200
started the show but as you can guess

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,719
you know you know a couple hundred

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,240
episodes later I've been exposed to a

42
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:54,000
lot of new stuff and that is a very that

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,119
is still a beautiful album yeah I mean

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,360
you know there were as you know and as

45
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,039
I'm probably the the listeners to this

46
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,360
podcast know there were really two

47
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:07,159
different kinds of Comedy records in the

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,399
in the Heyday uh of that genre one was

49
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,879
recorded standup routines uh which were

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,400
recorded live usually with an audience

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,680
uh and the other were these produced

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,720
records uh that sort of started with the

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,480
uh from to my ear with the recordings of

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,160
the the Goon shows from Great Britain

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,959
that traveled over here uh and then

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,720
freeberg started making these parodies

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,800
of uh pop hits in the 50s with a big

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,800
band and and with full production and a

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,440
lot of sound effects and basically he

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,400
was a refugee from Old Radio he had he

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,360
had done the last Network radio comedy

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,640
show he replaced Jack

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,159
Benny and uh when he got kicked off of

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,040
radio the capital you know the CBS Radio

65
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:01,040
Studio was about uh uh I'm calculating

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,280
now about a eight blocks walk from the

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,159
capital record

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Studio he just moved his act over there

69
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,319
wow that's the thing I'm pardon me and I

70
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,879
you know I'm I'm actually this is this

71
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,000
is pertinent because I'm I'm right now

72
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,239
researching the perfect sample chapter

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,440
to write for the comedy on vinyl book

74
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,080
and sort of realizing what I what I just

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,200
got myself into by picking the sketch

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,120
comedy chapter because while freeberg

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
you wouldn't people don't instantly

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,480
associate with Sketch I mean most of

79
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,439
this album most of that album is a

80
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,840
sketch album even even with all the

81
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:39,040
music on it y yeah it's basically it was

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,640
uh the most grandiose imaginable project

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,959
it was a uh Prospect for a Broadway

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,560
musical uh done as a comedy album right

85
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,640
so there were sketches and there were

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,200
songs and and freeberg idea was okay now

87
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,280
let's move it to Broadway which uh

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,760
bought him about four or five years of

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,599
absolute misery uh but I mean this was a

90
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,879
record that the minut it came out having

91
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,519
been a fan of freeberg

92
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:11,680
anyway I this was just such a revelation

93
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,480
and I and uh many of my friends uh you

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,079
know quickly memorized all of the all of

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,160
the songs on the record and would just

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,959
you know sing them to each other and

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,280
bother everybody else with it's you know

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,280
and I don't know if in 50 years if

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,479
anybody everybody's so many different

100
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,840
acts have tried to do let's do funny

101
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,680
American history because why wouldn't

102
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,479
you it's an Amer thing to do uh but it's

103
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,240
I don't know that it's been done as for

104
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,479
lack of better word as tight as this

105
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,080
album well you know freeberg came at it

106
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,039
I think with a a

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,919
distinctly to my ear and I I got to know

108
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:51,280
him uh later in several different guyses

109
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:56,360
I mean I was

110
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,000
uh I I I spent a month um doing a piece

111
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,160
for the New York Times magazine about

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,240
him which never ran wow

113
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:08,720
but we we spent a lot of time together

114
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:13,320
and then years later uh he got around to

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,919
doing the long delayed part two yes and

116
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,880
uh do Butler had his one of his great

117
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,360
members of his cast had had passed away

118
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,039
and of all things he called me to do a

119
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,639
couple of Parts on that record so I saw

120
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:30,520
how he worked uh with his uh ex-wife who

121
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,280
was his his late wife who was producer

122
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,759
and

123
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,880
collaborator um and so I I think going

124
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:41,919
back to the the first record um that he

125
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,120
approached doing comedy about American

126
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,080
history with something that most people

127
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,199
don't bring to it which is a great sense

128
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,160
of of absurdity and silliness and very

129
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,759
little ideology right yeah so it had a

130
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,600
broad appeal because you didn't have to

131
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,639
buy into a certain construct to enjoy it

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,560
it was just taking it was just taking

133
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,520
taking people off their off their

134
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,000
pedestals a bit and saying well these

135
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
really were real people and they

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,919
probably acted just like us but they did

137
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,280
this other stuff too and which is more a

138
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,599
comedic than a satirical uh approach and

139
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I I I've always sort of thought that

140
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,840
that's the perfect perspective to take I

141
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,680
mean I understand that you know if

142
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,880
you're a saturnist you you're you're by

143
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,960
Nature going to skew things and uh

144
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
although I mean I don't know maybe

145
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,919
that's not true maybe that's that's an

146
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,240
inaccurate way to to describe it no I

147
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,639
think I think a sauris brings a ique uh

148
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,080
and I don't think Stan brought a

149
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,319
critique I think he just brought a

150
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:44,080
a in a way he was the successor to Jack

151
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:47,800
Benny uh in more than time slot because

152
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,840
his comedy was based more on just let's

153
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,639
just make the assumption that these are

154
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,400
people like us with all of our flaws and

155
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,240
go from there as opposed to oh these are

156
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,039
a different breed you know these are

157
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,520
heroic and uh

158
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,319
people you know who don't scratch

159
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,360
and you know pick their noses and all

160
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,879
that stuff and I think he just brought

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,759
that which is a which is I say basically

162
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:16,080
a comedic view of history or of of you

163
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,319
know current events or anything I mean

164
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,080
um I I don't think one is better than

165
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,240
the other but I thought that that that

166
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,680
that marked Stan's approach to it which

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,680
was you know let's just imagine what

168
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,080
these people were really like uh take

169
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,440
the wigs off and see who they really

170
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:37,039
were yeah uh I thought that was you know

171
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,879
uh certainly he had he he was not blind

172
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
to certain realities I mean take an

173
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,879
Indian to lunch is one of the best

174
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,840
skewering of uh the American approach to

175
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
the native population that anybody's

176
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,159
ever done and it's two and a half

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,800
minutes and it's you can hum it yeah so

178
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,199
yeah what's wrong with

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,440
that yeah and I I guess if it's not

180
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,039
specific like you say it's it's not Saar

181
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,280
because as you say it doesn't but but

182
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,599
it's

183
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:07,120
it it has those ele it's it doesn't saiz

184
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:10,120
anybody in particular but it does take

185
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,639
that it's it's it's a weird line to walk

186
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,319
where where like you say you're making

187
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,159
everybody human and then that's where

188
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,000
the comedy comes from but also you get

189
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,319
to still pick apart some of the biggest

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,680
hypocrisy in all of American History

191
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,199
it's just very dense that way yeah yeah

192
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:30,080
and it you know it it's

193
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,200
it it it gives the Indians the

194
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,000
honor and the privilege of being human

195
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,640
too right which was the radical thing to

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,479
do at the time you know when they were

197
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,159
the Savages and the Redman so uh you

198
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,680
know he he was a very surprising guy I

199
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:49,320
mean because of his role in in making

200
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,560
fun of pop music and and then making fun

201
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,240
of American History um people who were

202
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
his big fans really thought he was a

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,519
much more radical person than he was you

204
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,560
know he was a very devout religious

205
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,519
person I think his dad had been a

206
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:09,079
minister wow so he came from a whole

207
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,320
different angle uh but he had this um

208
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:15,920
you know I guess what what influenced me

209
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,399
the most was that he harnessed really uh

210
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,440
serious musical talent to his

211
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,959
comedy yeah no I mean that is that is

212
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
the one thing where where I've always

213
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,760
every time we we talk about freeberg

214
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,480
work whether it's that album or whether

215
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,880
it's a child's Garden of freeberg which

216
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,279
we just did recent

217
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,560
um I I've always you would know better

218
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,519
now that I mean you did a piece uh is by

219
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,800
the way is that piece available anywhere

220
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,120
no oh my God I I don't I don't even know

221
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,640
if I have it oh my goodness they had

222
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,120
assigned a piece uh you know this was he

223
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,519
was just leaving he had left comedy he

224
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,399
he had left recording uh side of comedy

225
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,920
and had gone into advertising for pretty

226
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,880
much full bore and pretty much invented

227
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,920
uh humorous advertising right uh and and

228
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,040
was making a lot of money and was you

229
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,200
know revolutionizing the advertising

230
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,680
business uh taking the the the the piss

231
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,560
out of uh clients uh as they're called

232
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,800
making fun of them and enriching them uh

233
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,320
because it made people like the the

234
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,040
client and therefore the product that

235
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,040
was his theory um and the New York Times

236
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,040
assigned a piece about freeberg and

237
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,160
making that transition and they had

238
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,480
assigned it to A A A friend of mine a

239
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,200
freelance writer named Michael Leiden

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,680
and Michael uh it turns out was busy

241
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,680
taking

242
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,519
LSD mesino County at the time and

243
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,279
couldn't be bothered and so he called me

244
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,839
and said you know would you like this

245
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,360
assignment and I said

246
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,880
sure uh because I was doing freelance

247
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,240
writing in those days so I I picked it

248
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,000
up and and spent all this time with free

249
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:01,000
and sent the piece in and I was

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,079
really I was coming at it from a um an

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
irritating kid point of view which was

252
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,440
you know sort of disappointed that

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,760
freeberg had U left the world of comedy

254
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,760
and and satirical comedy behind sure um

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,880
and and so I was you know sort of homing

256
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,200
in on that but not unpleasantly I mean

257
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,360
we really did spend a lot of time

258
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,560
together and the piece goes into the New

259
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,720
York Times magazine and the rejection

260
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,519
says this piece assumes that people know

261
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,360
who freeberg is and I thought well why

262
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,600
did you assign it didn't know who he was

263
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
you know you assigned it with this angle

264
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,480
of you know why did he go from Comedy to

265
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,040
advertising right and you're there's

266
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,560
there's an assumption there that the

267
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,240
that the pronoun is represented by

268
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,320
somebody that people know yeah wow so

269
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,959
yeah oh my god well and I guess and I

270
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,240
apologize so I I I uh I kind of drifted

271
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,680
there but my the purpose of asking you

272
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,279
does that exist is a I want to read it

273
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,160
but since it doesn't probably exist well

274
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,279
that sucks but it sounds like an amazing

275
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,600
experience what is your perspective on

276
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,760
on the way and the reason for him

277
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,920
tearing apart pop comedy the way he did

278
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,480
cuz there's nobody possibly more

279
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,639
potentially Adept at doing it but it

280
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,199
sometimes it reads is like I can't tell

281
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,839
if there is some bitterness there or if

282
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,360
it's out of pure love or if there's a

283
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,120
mix he hated rock and roll absolutely

284
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,360
did okay he hated rock and roll he came

285
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,600
out of you know the earlier kind of

286
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,720
music and thought that rock and roll was

287
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,800
he he viewed rock and roll the way most

288
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,000
people who were fans of of rock music

289
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,720
now view

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,959
hipop just put it that way um so he came

291
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,880
at it with you know the view that this

292
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,040
was barely music it was radically

293
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,639
oversimplified and and and pathetically

294
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,560
under under talented and um that he he

295
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,760
did have a critique yeah that was the

296
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,399
thing with with the music paries he did

297
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,279
have a very strong critique um and and

298
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,839
um that could to Rock Fans read his

299
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,440
bitterness um but he he didn't limit it

300
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,959
to rock and roll I mean he he did a

301
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,279
wicked parody of Harry bellante

302
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:15,040
pseudo Caribbean Banana Boat Song you

303
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:20,320
know which was basically kind of tinpan

304
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,639
Caribbean alley um and he he also tore a

305
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,240
new one for uh a guy who was making a

306
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:30,639
huge number of uh hit records in in the

307
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:37,079
mid-50s Mitch Miller with these horrible

308
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:42,519
uh Reverb drenched uh Unison singing uh

309
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:44,240
male choirs um and uh the one that he

310
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,079
picked was the Yellow Rose of Texas and

311
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,880
just you know right ripped RI ripped it

312
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:50,720
up one way and down the other so it

313
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,680
wasn't just rock and roll he just was

314
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,199
was hating what was on the or was uh

315
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,079
picking apart what was on the Hit Parade

316
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,720
but he did have a special animus for

317
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,680
rock and roll that's what's just so

318
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,120
crazy to me is that he's clearly was

319
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,839
clearly a brilliant comedian and clearly

320
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,160
had this sharp eye towards what a very

321
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,959
like not single-minded but very focused

322
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,199
when he put together something but also

323
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,160
he's got this just grumpy old man

324
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,880
aesthetic to him that just blows my mind

325
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,000
compared with that he he he wasn't he

326
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
was he was a a traditionalist you know

327
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,800
in a lot of ways especially and and

328
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,680
musically too but you know the thing

329
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,600
that pervades the the lp the the United

330
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,279
States of America volume one as it was

331
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,560
called even when it came out right uh is

332
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:41,800
the perfectionism he was a total [ __ ]

333
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:46,680
perfectionist yeah and I the conclusion

334
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:49,720
I came to when I wrote the piece um just

335
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,279
I remember was that that's what drove

336
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,560
him you know he he had had a little

337
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,560
fling with television that I think a

338
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,839
couple I think ABC gave him a show uh

339
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,079
for a little bit um

340
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,800
but the only place where he could get

341
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,519
the budget that would allow him to do

342
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,560
things on the with the Perfection that

343
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,920
he craved was advertising yeah he went

344
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,160
there for the

345
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,320
perfectionism man that's oh that's CRA

346
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,720
you know and it's so F that's the other

347
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,480
thing too about this album I just I just

348
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,880
grabbed the the lp just to take a look

349
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,360
at it just to see uh I guess just to

350
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,519
make myself sad because I'm not sure how

351
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,160
many of these people are still around

352
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:34,079
frankly who are who are on the album um

353
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,800
but the just the sheer production value

354
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,720
on this like in terms of sound effects

355
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,279
too which is one of just it's just one

356
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,920
of my favorite things about sketch or or

357
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:43,920
great comedy albums it's just so

358
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,319
beautifully put together so not and I

359
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,639
again I don't know how much of that was

360
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,880
him but again I'm sure at the end of the

361
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,600
day the final say was you know that Echo

362
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,360
should be you know less Mitch Miller and

363
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,600
more me he was he was you know from

364
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,680
having been around and having watched

365
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,079
him do the the second record uh I think

366
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,199
there was not a choice that he was not

367
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,920
involved in yeah he he that's what he

368
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,680
loved you know was making all those

369
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,079
choices to to get to something that he'd

370
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,880
H in his head and he wanted to uh

371
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,440
replicate it out in the real world I

372
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,040
just love that this is a time period and

373
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm not trying to to be too heavily

374
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,440
nostalgic but this is a time period

375
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,680
where you had that as an option well you

376
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,560
know what I can write a thing and it'll

377
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,680
be an LP and this will be a thing that

378
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,279
maybe maybe as many people will buy as

379
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,560
bought the first family that' be great

380
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,480
but you know you can only hope

381
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,160
uh just that this was an option well you

382
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,319
know there are these little little

383
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,839
windows that open up from time to time I

384
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:42,240
mean uh

385
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:46,800
10 or so years later the window opened

386
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,199
up again uh forced open I guess one

387
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,319
could say by the fire sign theater sure

388
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,880
uh and and we walked through that window

389
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:55,880
uh or crawl through that window long

390
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,079
enough to do the record that we did The

391
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:04,000
credibility gap at at Warner uh and then

392
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:08,000
it closed right up again um so you

393
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,880
know you can't look at any Med my

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,559
feeling is you can't look at any Medium

395
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,000
as as your home because

396
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,360
of the uh

397
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,760
opportunities come and go the window

398
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,520
opens and closes for anything that's not

399
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,799
uh

400
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,400
resolutely um of the- moment commercial

401
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,679
uh and sometimes it

402
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,559
people in an industry like records or

403
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,840
later on Radio FM radio or later on

404
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,160
cable TV sometimes they're at a point

405
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,039
where they don't know what the formula

406
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,880
is and that's the magic moment and then

407
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,720
when they figure out the formula it's

408
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,640
goodbye right right uh was there was

409
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,960
there another album that you had in mind

410
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,480
besides this one because it did sound

411
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,000
like you said you you might have had

412
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,880
another one that influenced you kind of

413
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,520
heavily as well

414
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,760
well this this was the most influential

415
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,799
but I mean I mean I I I grew up on Bob

416
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:07,799
and Ray so anything that they put out on

417
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:11,080
record was was you know uh I I never

418
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:14,039
thought their records quite reached the

419
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Apex of of their work that the the daily

420
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:20,080
radio output did but I thought in I

421
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,440
think inside Bob and Ray was the one

422
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,840
that got the closest because it was

423
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,679
basically just a collection of great

424
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,039
radio sketches okay um you know and and

425
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:33,679
there again um to me

426
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:36,039
marked the the move forward from

427
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,480
freeberg in a way because freeberg was

428
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:42,120
still harking back to that world of of

429
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,559
Comedy audio comedy where maybe you even

430
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,440
had an audience but you certainly had a

431
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,840
big band had a lot of cast of characters

432
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,720
and and Bob and Ray moved it into a

433
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,240
little Studio where it was just them and

434
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,440
one one sound effects guy uh and they

435
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,039
were the world uh of all these

436
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,799
characters and that you know that sort

437
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,080
of the more modern approach to doing uh

438
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:05,440
audio audio comedy um yeah they they

439
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,760
influenced me totally yeah you know I

440
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,200
mean I guess the more I think about

441
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,760
because I think the one album of theirs

442
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,280
we did Phil Proctor picked uh the two

443
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,520
and only uh which is a great album but

444
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,960
it's also I think it's if I'm not

445
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,080
mistaken it's their Broadway show it's a

446
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,320
live stage so it's a different

447
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,000
experience than what you're talking

448
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,520
about which is sounds like just 100% the

449
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,840
precursor to what podcasts have now

450
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,480
taken for granted as if you want to do

451
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,240
comedy it's two people in a room y but

452
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,360
almost never sound effects so I mean

453
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,840
they at least had that over on yeah yeah

454
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,679
they had sound effects they had you know

455
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,120
they had a a great engineer who was a

456
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,960
sound effects man and also was the their

457
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,799
music guy you know found all the all the

458
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,039
great theme music for everything they

459
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:51,000
did um and that was you know they really

460
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,720
did invent that uh uh starting out in in

461
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,840
on the radio in Boston in the middle of

462
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,400
the afternoon entertaining Boston

463
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,240
Housewives and then and then moving to

464
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,640
New York and

465
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,679
and the two and only is great because

466
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,679
you get to hear how well they could work

467
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,159
at audience right um You Know It All

468
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,120
Those

469
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:17,440
Years closeted in in radio Studios of

470
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,039
various sizes of smallness um did not

471
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,840
mean that they could not work an

472
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,159
audience and they that that that album

473
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,960
shows that they could but I mean what

474
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,240
what their bread and butter was was

475
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,960
sitting across from mics in in a room

476
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,679
and and I think inside Bob and raised

477
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,960
the name of the record very obscure

478
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,760
record but that's the one that I I

479
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,559
really loved did I mean I the Assumption

480
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,840
might be since you've done so much

481
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,480
musical comedy that freeberg was the

482
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,400
bigger influence but did you ever

483
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,400
listening to B I mean did listening I

484
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,840
I'll just say this uh just get it out of

485
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,320
the way watching watching you and all of

486
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
the folks that you're associated with

487
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,080
made me think when early on that I could

488
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,760
do improv like everybody else about 15

489
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,559
20 years ago we all thought we could do

490
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,240
improv from watching you you guys did

491
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,000
you from listening to like a bob and Ray

492
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
did you're like oh crap I can do this

493
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,799
was there was there ever a moment of

494
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,559
that oh God yeah I mean that was what I

495
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,320
wanted to do um and when I got with this

496
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,240
group which was originally on the radio

497
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,120
in Los Angeles called The credibility

498
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,960
gap um we were doing three 10minute

499
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,640
shows a day and I thought I this is 10

500
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,679
years after I'd been you know listening

501
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,760
to Bob and Ray thinking God I wish I

502
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:31,240
could do that now I was doing that um by

503
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,760
the way of improv you know

504
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,720
um neither

505
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,440
Christopher well I I can't I'm I'm G to

506
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,880
maybe say more than I know but I don't I

507
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,520
think I think this is true uh neither

508
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:51,520
Christopher nor Michael Nor I had uh

509
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,919
studied improv uh taken an improv class

510
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,919
uh been in an improv group uh fancied

511
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,840
ourselves as improv artists uh spinal

512
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:05,039
tap came came not from a desire to do an

513
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,360
impro movie MH but from a sense that the

514
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,720
only way to make this movie look as if

515
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,440
it's a documentary for Real uh was to do

516
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,520
it uh improvisational yeah

517
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,880
improvisational style well to sorry it

518
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,360
was a choice that came out of what we

519
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
wanted the movie to look like not what

520
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,279
we wanted to do if it had been a movie

521
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,640
that had come out of the Second City and

522
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:28,520
this is in no way to crap on them or or

523
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,120
what they do and how they teach people

524
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,799
it would feel it wouldn't feel so

525
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,360
natural I mean there might even be an

526
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,720
element and I don't know I'd have to re

527
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,200
it's been a while since I've seen it but

528
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,440
there might be an element of it feeling

529
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,120
very simple I mean again even even the

530
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,600
the type of improv you're doing I could

531
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,480
be wrong but it doesn't feel like well

532
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,360
here's the game here's the setup here's

533
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,760
the this this to this there was not

534
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,200
there was you know what what we because

535
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,400
we as I say we we hadn't I had been a

536
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,440
fan of the of of several improv groups

537
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,559
had seen a lot of their work and knew a

538
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,880
little bit about how they work um but

539
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,120
what we were just we were we had tried

540
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,640
writing a script and uh realized that

541
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:17,400
was not the way to do this movie um and

542
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,640
so the we wrote uh an outline of what

543
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,120
happened in each scene and so and and

544
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,520
this has been sort of the through line

545
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,080
for Christopher's improvisational movies

546
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,559
ever since right the job of the

547
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,279
performers is just to tell the story of

548
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,000
that

549
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:37,159
scene period MH uh you know and so be

550
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,400
that person in that scene telling this

551
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,559
story and uh it's not about games and

552
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,960
it's not I mean the one thing that I

553
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:51,320
think we all uh took from um what we

554
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,039
know about improvisational theory is

555
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,679
it's more about listening than talking

556
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:59,360
yeah uh and and that but that's true of

557
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,200
that should be true of acting anyway

558
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:07,039
should be all acting um so you know

559
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,480
anyway we've wandered off of com well we

560
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,640
can get back very quickly because this

561
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,880
is making me think of in Terms if if if

562
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,799
I was to look at if somebody were to

563
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,159
tell me at this point oh credibil most

564
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,000
of the guys from The credibility gap are

565
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,400
going to make a movie about rock and

566
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,400
roll and at the same time if you just

567
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,240
said the guys from National Lampoon are

568
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,520
going to make a movie about

569
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,640
college the immediate thing I think of

570
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,000
is is x-rated it really does doesn't

571
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,679
feel like like you guys must have had to

572
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,120
tone yourselves down to because it's so

573
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,960
like just listening just if I think

574
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,679
about a great gift idea um and actually

575
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,159
side note I actually really like floats

576
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,480
I but butk I really do enjoy it but if

577
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,399
we're going to talk about a a great gift

578
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,600
idea there's some really harsh stuff in

579
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:53,880
there that you maybe just couldn't maybe

580
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,720
wouldn't translate to a film I don't

581
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,200
know but you know well did you ever hear

582
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,159
uh um Bronze Age of radio

583
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,640
yes I have but only the once and I you

584
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,039
know heard great about the harshest

585
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:11,960
thing you'll ever hear us do was on

586
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:14,080
Bronze Age of radio um and um it was

587
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:19,200
sort of indicative of of what we got

588
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,600
away with um in in that era which was

589
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,640
there was uh somebody you know

590
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,640
everything we did was was based on a

591
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,440
news story that was what it all was

592
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,559
generated by and there was some some

593
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,039
news story long forgotten about somebody

594
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,360
complaining about a commercial being

595
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:39,559
racist and okay our response was you

596
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,799
think that commercial was racist listen

597
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:46,600
to these and we just had a [ __ ] field

598
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,200
day with okay here are the most racist

599
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,720
commercials we can

600
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,120
imagine see what you think of these okay

601
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,320
yeah and they were done in this style

602
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,480
that and then because we were very

603
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,600
um interested in form

604
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,240
as well as in uh satirical content um so

605
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,399
there was a second level of the joke

606
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,000
which was there was a guy channel 13 in

607
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:16,039
Los Angeles uh used to show old movies

608
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,600
on Saturday and Sunday nights and um and

609
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,640
in between you know in the commercial

610
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,679
breaks rather than showing regular

611
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,120
commercials like you see on television

612
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,880
uh there were these weird different

613
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,279
commercials uh

614
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,279
I figured out I you know I I I always

615
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,240
follow my nose where this stuff happens

616
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:40,880
oh this looks weird why is that it was a

617
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,559
guy who I don't know if he was hired by

618
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,840
the station or if he bought the time and

619
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,960
then turned around and sold it to these

620
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,679
these advertisers but he went out with

621
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,679
his little little 16 super 16 camera and

622
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,880
shot these commercials for these various

623
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,240
retailers and then he narrated the

624
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,760
commercials himself with his big boys

625
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,200
name Fred May and and and the opening

626
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,880
sort of teaser line or the the end

627
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:13,000
tagline was done in very heavy slap Echo

628
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:16,520
by his wife Gloria oo I like the boots

629
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you know this stuff so and you'd see

630
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,520
four of them in a row that would be a

631
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,919
commercial break it's four Fred May

632
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,799
commercials in a row for different

633
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,679
little establishments so that was the

634
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:30,200
the form of the racist commercials was

635
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:32,120
for Fred May commercial for you know it

636
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,200
was and it was just the strangest but

637
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,159
you know outrageous and transgressive in

638
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,840
every way

639
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:41,000
imaginable so that there's

640
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,960
that well there's this that's another

641
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,039
thing too that being born of a certain

642
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,000
age I'll never be able to quite relate

643
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,760
to is that there's this moment again

644
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,080
around this period around the same time

645
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,559
National Lampoon's doing stuff where if

646
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,519
I listen to it if if if I'm I guess if

647
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm in a super sensitive mood I might I

648
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,480
might miss the satire if because again

649
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,919
because it's just so full bore it's just

650
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,000
full [ __ ] steam ahead on some of you

651
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:13,039
know a lot of it is just to make us

652
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,679
laugh sure and you know I I I don't know

653
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,000
if four people who listened to that

654
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,960
sketch when it was on the radio said to

655
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
their their their smoking companion wow

656
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,840
those are that's just like those

657
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,559
commercials on channel 13 right you know

658
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:32,080
but it it it gave us an organ izing

659
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,960
principle for doing this transgressive U

660
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:39,440
idea and that's you know in a way um it

661
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,640
it's it becomes irrelevant whether

662
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,240
anybody gets that level it's just that's

663
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,159
what we needed to kick us into into high

664
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,919
gear and and and get us to do the piece

665
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:54,399
and um you know when you're doing uh two

666
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:56,840
a show or two a day um that's what you

667
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,640
need is just right you know oh how would

668
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,320
we do this oh I got it we'll do it this

669
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,919
way and then you go how do you do

670
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,480
something though that is potentially so

671
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,679
high-minded as hey guess what guys we're

672
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,640
going to take down racism but at the

673
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,399
same time is just it's just a big [ __ ]

674
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,600
about for a while too like there's a

675
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,320
real it's a it's a tough line to walk

676
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,559
isn't it it is it is and it and you know

677
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,360
you have to you have to trust yourself

678
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,559
that um and your audience that they know

679
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,880
where you're coming from you you can't

680
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,720
be too dainty about saying now remember

681
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,360
please we're not really the

682
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:37,159
right uh so um but you know that's

683
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,600
that's that's what I guess what we

684
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,480
carried I and the people I work I've

685
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,960
been working with uh all the way through

686
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,679
I mean the the head of marketing this is

687
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,679
again veering off for a moment the head

688
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,600
of marketing at the alleged Film Studio

689
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,480
that released spinal tap said to us like

690
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,840
two weeks before the movie came out guys

691
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,519
don't you think you have to like in the

692
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,840
first 30 seconds of the movie wink to

693
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:01,880
let people know you're kidding oh my God

694
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,919
yeah literally yeah all four of us we

695
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,760
all four said Unison no we don't thanks

696
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,559
U Christ so that's but that's the same

697
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,880
thing you know no we're not the racist

698
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:16,039
so you know um you have to trust the

699
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:18,159
audience that they and I don't know I

700
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:23,440
don't know if the

701
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,320
if if uh one could do that well it was a

702
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,679
product of its time and and you can't

703
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,519
ever say okay well we couldn't do that

704
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,000
now

705
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,960
one might never get the impulse to do

706
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,360
that now but um whether you can trust

707
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,519
the audience in the same way I mean I I

708
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,200
assume you do I still make comedy every

709
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,240
week and I assume that the audience gets

710
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,960
it and uh I I'll I'll transgress from

711
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,840
time to time myself but um you

712
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,159
know in in in that era if you were

713
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,360
making fun of a racist you could have

714
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,039
him talk like a racist yeah and you

715
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,159
can't do that

716
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:02,159
anymore yeah it's

717
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,440
on the other hand I got fired from uh a

718
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,519
radio station in Los Angeles in 1975 for

719
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,480
saying the word penis on the air uh are

720
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:14,639
you for what really yeah yeah and it's a

721
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,320
long story why it was it was it was as a

722
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,919
part of a joke as a part of a s parody

723
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,679
of of something that was very popular on

724
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,080
the radio in those days and the general

725
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,039
manager of the station actually said

726
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,480
when he fired me listen I could have

727
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,080
understand if you had said [ __ ] or [ __ ]

728
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,600
but penis

729
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,080
now of course Howard Stern gets half a

730
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,240
billion dollars for saying penis every

731
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,360
day but you can't have a racist talk

732
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,080
like a racist wow that is uh there's a

733
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,000
lot going on there too much to delve

734
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,200
into I guess well it's it's my law of of

735
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,039
conservation of taboo uhuh there's a

736
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,440
there's a standard amount of Taboo in a

737
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,760
society but it moves over time to

738
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,679
different attaches to different things I

739
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,799
guess it's true

740
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,440
I it's up to tolerance it's up to you

741
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,279
know media it's up to uh personal

742
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,960
preference I suppose but yeah that's wow

743
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,960
um and it's also up to Mark Ferman of

744
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,760
course yeah

745
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,039
naturally do you okay so I I do want to

746
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,960
ask you about something this actually I

747
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,080
was just thinking about this H I don't

748
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,080
know why the other day I was just

749
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,200
thinking about how people are

750
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,440
complaining about Jimmy Fallon's Tonight

751
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,840
Show and I understand everybody's

752
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,480
complaints but then I immediately got to

753
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:29,200
thinking about your Johnny Carson on on

754
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,880
on a great gift idea which is you know

755
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,919
if you want to talk about scathing it's

756
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,399
pretty wonderful it's I mean if I'm not

757
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,000
M mistaken it's the whole half of the

758
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,840
album right uh or just about it's 13

759
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,679
minutes there we go okay that's right

760
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,440
okay very long though and but uh

761
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,519
obviously infinitely listenable but

762
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,559
there's this you're I mean you had this

763
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,000
opportunity to [ __ ] on an American icon

764
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,159
and I'm and I'm obviously but I want to

765
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,279
know what the impetus behind it

766
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,559
was um

767
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,120
besides the fact that I think most

768
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,399
people know that Johnny Carson was

769
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,960
secretly a lot like that behind the

770
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,679
scenes maybe more than what you're

771
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,120
actually portraying but well yeah much

772
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:16,519
more a much meaner person from

773
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,720
everything we can find out now yeah um

774
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,399
it had it had um like most of the

775
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,080
sketches on that record started out as a

776
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,200
sketch on a radio show which meant there

777
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,639
was some news story behind it I think it

778
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:31,039
had something to do uh Rickles was the

779
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:33,320
guest on in that sketch um a man whom

780
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,120
I've come to like and admire greatly by

781
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:39,159
the way in the in recent years Mr

782
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,200
Rickles but um I think it had something

783
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,200
to do with

784
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,679
somebody evincing surprise that Rickles

785
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,760
had uh attacked them when they were on

786
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
The Tonight Show or made fun of them

787
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,360
when they were on The Tonight Show or

788
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,360
something and so we just thought what

789
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,799
what what do you expect and it was just

790
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,600
okay um but I I don't know if that was

791
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,639
the I it definitely involved something

792
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,720
to do with Rickles in The Tonight Show

793
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:07,519
those choices were made for us and then

794
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,240
we just went okay so uh let's let's do

795
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,240
one where you know there's a guest on

796
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,960
from this uh gay organization and then

797
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:20,159
brickles and you know and we know what's

798
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,520
going to happen um and I think that was

799
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,280
it I think it was a a person from G I

800
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,359
don't know anyway that's what made us do

801
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,480
it um and then there was all of the

802
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:36,280
sort of builtup sense of of Carson as

803
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,159
this very Middle Road kind of I mean by

804
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,839
that time he had a clothing line like

805
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,639
anybody wanted to dress like that um and

806
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,440
he had this you know

807
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:50,280
survi uh uh sidekick who you know who

808
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,480
laughed too hard at everything he said

809
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,480
Ed

810
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:02,680
McMahon um and that very kind of

811
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,720
Clubby scene Showbiz scene that that

812
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:09,200
show

813
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:13,280
embodied um it and you know as a as a

814
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,079
student of Comedy or lover of Comedy My

815
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,359
Kind of mildly suppressed outrage that

816
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,240
Johnny had just stolen most of his bits

817
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,560
from his

818
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,359
betters uh he'd stole from GLE and he

819
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,119
stole from Winters he stole from Steve

820
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,359
Allen uh all of his best known bits were

821
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:32,320
basically total lifts from um those

822
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:35,760
other guys right uh so it was just

823
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,119
seemed to me time yeah yeah and we done

824
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,400
it on the radio it was kind of good but

825
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,079
we thought man we could do a really

826
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,359
great version of this for the record and

827
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:48,400
uh we had a wonderful engineer at Warner

828
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,880
Don Landy

829
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,119
de uh brilliant guy and just a lovely

830
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,680
person to spend hours and hours in a in

831
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:02,520
a studio with um and I I gave him

832
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,440
certain technical challenges to uh uh

833
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,640
accomplish with that piece uh we

834
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,920
actually hired the guy who sweetened

835
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,440
most of the sitcoms really yeah so he

836
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,280
comes in with his laugh machine and we

837
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,760
get to watch that at work wow and um say

838
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,640
you know okay we want a little like a

839
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,960
naughty titter here he okay good and

840
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,359
then he covers up his little machine and

841
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,720
switches out his little little tape um

842
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,119
they're not really cassettes they're

843
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,920
they're cartridges of some sort little

844
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,720
mini cartridges and then he plays this

845
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,119
weird keyboard that he's got and as he

846
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,720
plays the

847
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,920
laugh he kind of half silently does the

848
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,960
laugh along with it so he's he's like

849
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,319
he's like a singing organist except on a

850
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,560
laugh it was [ __ ] amazing wow God

851
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:51,280
that's so and for the record it might

852
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,160
now be my favorite Carson once I was

853
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,040
finally introduced to it I it's just

854
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,319
there's some there is something about

855
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,400
your impression that's just I don't I

856
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:03,560
don't know what it is it just it's like

857
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,800
there's this extra filth to it maybe

858
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,800
maybe there's also this sense that there

859
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,280
was such a formula to it all sure to his

860
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:16,000
jokes uh that's you know in in the

861
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,680
monologue and in in his comebacks it all

862
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,119
has a a a grating sameness to it which

863
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,400
is one of the things we were pointing

864
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:29,240
out uh and uh uh so there's that and

865
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,040
then um

866
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:36,440
I don't

867
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,520
know if this fed into that because I'm I

868
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,720
I would have

869
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,119
to review the

870
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,960
chronology but we certainly had a a very

871
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,520
uh unpleasant experience with The

872
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,839
Tonight Show I was gonna ask okay yeah

873
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,160
um we

874
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,960
were this has to

875
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:03,400
be chronology yeah maybe maybe maybe

876
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:07,160
this happened before um we were doing uh

877
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,359
live show credibility gap and um a

878
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,599
talent uh coordinator from The Tonight

879
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,720

880
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,839

881
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,520
invited to see you know what in our live

882
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,240
act could work on The Tonight Show and

883
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,640
uh and we had a lot of different kinds

884
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,319
of sketches and he said and we one of

885
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:31,000
them was a fake daytime talk show called

886
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:31,000
the Danny Wade show where

887
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:42,640
uh the uh DC Comics had just uh uh come

888
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:45,200
out with u an anti-drug thing and so uh

889
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,119
the sketch was uh this horrible Bland

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,400
daytime talk show the Danny Wade show

903
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,240
through the day before for

904
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:22,240
camera we said okay and we get there and

905
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,760
he says now look it's just for camera it

906
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,280
doesn't it don't you know it doesn't

907
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,680
even have to be a performance you can go

908
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,160
through it like you know double triple

909
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,319
speed they just want to see who's you

910
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,480
know get get the shots

911
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:37,200
mhm okay so we just rattle through it

912
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,920
without any performance to it at

913
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,400
all and then he comes ashen-faced and

914
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,160
says

915
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:52,319
guys um I'm sorry but um Johnny was in

916
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:58,119
the control room uh during that and uh

917
00:39:52,319 --> 00:40:02,880
he he's he doesn't want that on the show

918
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,880
well wait a minute you said you said you

919
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:12,240
said boy oh boy yeah that and how I mean

920
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,680
okay I'm assuming this is your shot I

921
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,800
mean I know at The Tonight Show means at

922
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,560
the time this is your shot yep and it

923
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,960
just Falls the [ __ ] to the floor oh my

924
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,079
God yeah so that may have that may have

925
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,119
influ piece on the record yeah yeah well

926
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,440
no that's that's that's understandable

927
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,760
um Jes but the piece was written before

928
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,800
that yeah but it may have impelled us to

929
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,319
say you know if if if the and I don't

930
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,680
recall whether there was any discussion

931
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:39,119
about whether the whe here's Johnny

932
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,319
should be on the where's Johnny should

933
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,560
be on the record but if there was that

934
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:45,599
might have slightly put a finger on the

935
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,440
scale you know the assumption is when

936
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,000
you were writing the Carson thing that

937
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,200
you're writing this with no fear is that

938
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,240
absolutely the case because none of you

939
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,640
were you know a-listers you're you're

940
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,000
just you I mean you're doing radio doing

941
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,480
albums is it I mean is it just

942
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,440
completely no fear that you're writing

943
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,720
this

944
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,520
with yeah

945
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:13,119
yeah I sound a little ruul as I say

946
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:17,160
that yeah um

947
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,240
yeah but look I mean I I I I live that

948
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,359
thing to to this day I mean I've been

949
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:26,760
I've made fun of most of the people uh

950
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:29,560
uh in the New York Media news scene and

951
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,560
and then when I had a a serious

952
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:35,400
documentary few years back about the

953
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,920
flooding of New Orleans um I actually

954
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,880
allowed myself the privilege of being

955
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,040
shot that uh none of them would give it

956
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,520
the time of

957
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,599
day well I mean that's I was yeah for a

958
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,920
second I was going to say do you miss it

959
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,880
but obviously you don't obviously I mean

960
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,599
I know you're you're well known for

961
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,240
having principles and uh and and I love

962
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,760
that as a comedian and a Satur is that

963
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,359
you can still do that and still also be

964
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,880
funny it's it's hard well I mean

965
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,240
fortunately I have a day job sure so uh

966
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,720
that that cushions the impact of a lot

967
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,280
that that phone will stop ringing you're

968
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,240
a receptionist that's your day job right

969
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:13,400
if I'm not mistaken just doctor is not

970
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:19,400
in um but you know it it it's it's not

971
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:21,640
an easy line to walk um and um I guess I

972
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,359
mean look I had I had

973
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:29,480
uh at the age of 35 a taxable income of

974
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:34,280
zero MH uh um but I never had kids right

975
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:38,000
and it it does you know um if you're not

976
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,400
making the the decision for other people

977
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,359
you're just making the decision for

978
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,880
yourself it makes it a little easier if

979
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,800
if you're if you're having to uh take

980
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,240
that risk and it's uh your kids's

981
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,440
College uh on the

982
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,240
line uh things are change things are

983
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,599
different for sure uh you know I I I was

984
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,240
thinking about this and thinking about

985
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,440
just The credibility gap and the fact

986
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,480
that I mean uh you know in in in Reading

987
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,440
up a little bit more about your

988
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,359
influences realizing that uh you know uh

989
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,599
you know you you acknowledging uh fire

990
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,000
sign's impact and I didn't even realize

991
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,160
you had been in one of David osman's

992
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,400
albums I wish I I had I had no idea

993
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,240
there is this at at this period there's

994
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,400
a lot to do with either making fun of

995
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,880
oldtime radio or I mean you guys

996
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,960
specifically like to take apart old film

997
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,000
strips like picking on that kind of

998
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,680
stuff like there is this this that's

999
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,680
another thing about this era of Comedy

1000
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,280
where uh post-war America was

1001
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,599
just you know in your subconscious and

1002
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,520
you I guess you probably had no choice

1003
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,400
but to spew like that up onto like you

1004
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,720
know onto an album and make fun of that

1005
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,720
I I'm I I just I don't know I I'm I'm

1006
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,440
because I think we all take it for

1007
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,359
granted as this Nostalgia thing but I

1008
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,440
think it must have been something

1009
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:56,359
different for you as you're making it uh

1010
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,040
you're purging these things that were uh

1011
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:02,480
poisoning your brain as you were growing

1012
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:05,640
up MH you know um I mean look this is

1013
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,640
this this gets into uh more serious

1014
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,599
stuff but I mean this was an

1015
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,839
ERA uh

1016
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,559
where we

1017
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:19,760
were turning around and seeing

1018
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:25,760
everything that we had

1019
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:29,520
imbibed as uh growing up uh as

1020
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:34,079
being kind of brain poison yeah yeah and

1021
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,960
we're reacting against it uh and so um

1022
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,880
the image that that sort of stays with

1023
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:45,599
me from that is that people would go to

1024
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:49,920
midnight movies to uh laugh at the uh uh

1025
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:53,160
film shorts versions of uh

1026
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,720
Batman uh that had been made 10 15 years

1027
00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:00,079
earlier uh and laughing at it at the at

1028
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:04,040
the simple mindedness of it right uh cuz

1029
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,720
we were in the middle of a hideous

1030
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,920
complicated

1031
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,520
um

1032
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,079
war

1033
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,040
and

1034
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:19,200
something clicked for me the first time

1035
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,480
and this is now some years later the

1036
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:27,880
first time I heard a um a high official

1037
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,640
who was either in that cohort or just

1038
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,359
slightly older say with a straight face

1039
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:37,520
we know who the bad guys

1040
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,520
are and I realized okay that era is over

1041
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,760
we're back to taking this that that

1042
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:46,680
programming seriously right that are

1043
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,800
that once again it's proved that comedy

1044
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,800
and satire doesn't

1045
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:58,680
work uh yeah you're right that was dark

1046
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:00,440
that was Heavy uh yeah I boy and I guess

1047
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,280
the thing is the more I think about it I

1048
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,440
think about this era of making comedy um

1049
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,240
again working mostly without a net to

1050
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,400
use a [ __ ] overused phrase but I mean

1051
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,680
I'm I'm I'm of a generation of people

1052
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,359
who's wearing that garbage they grew up

1053
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,760
with on their shirts constantly and I

1054
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:18,480
count myself among them I'm not

1055
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,119
necessarily proud but I'm I you know I'm

1056
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,160
a zombie in some ways and I try to fight

1057
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,440
it but I do want to know like well you

1058
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,720
know and then the funny thing is at the

1059
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,480
same time like I'm now speaking to a man

1060
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,480
who whose voice I've been listening to

1061
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,240
for most of my life mhm and who's been

1062
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,520
involved with the best of and maybe I

1063
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,599
mean I understand your opinions about

1064
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,079
the later years but I mean uh you know

1065
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,520
the best of the comedy that I grew up

1066
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:43,760
with as a kid that also had this equally

1067
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,839
pop culture like I had a literally had a

1068
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,240
Teenage Mutant Ninja Simpson shirt don't

1069
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,960
ask me what that was that was a

1070
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:53,599
wonderful bootleg but you know uh there

1071
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,800
is this fight and I'm I and I I don't

1072
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,520
know what the moment's going to be for

1073
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,000
me shouldn't it have been 911 maybe but

1074
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,839
I don't know what the moment's supposed

1075
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,760
to be for this generation of comedians

1076
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:07,599
to do something

1077
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:10,520
new well you know I I I don't know um I

1078
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,520
think that

1079
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,440
uh the

1080
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,319
um the the

1081
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,200
um the thing to me that's that's always

1082
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:28,040
going to be new is um to

1083
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:32,000
just do without the formula you know I

1084
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:34,520
mean I look at uh the comedy movies that

1085
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,240
get cranked out now and it's it's no

1086
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,760
different in a way than than when I was

1087
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,040
coming up you know there's a formula and

1088
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,319
some of them succeed and some of them

1089
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,800
fail but that doesn't dissuade the uh

1090
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,839
people in charge from believing in the

1091
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,440
formula even though it's batting average

1092
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:53,680
would get you back kicked back down to

1093
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:58,440
the minors

1094
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:00,960
um and you know you

1095
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,400
it's always easier to sell something if

1096
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,200
it if it uh partakes of the formula I

1097
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,720
mean we got turned down by every major

1098
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,839
studio in Hollywood when we were trying

1099
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,319
to pitch spinal tap yeah um because it

1100
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:17,079
didn't wasn't the formula and and even

1101
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:21,240
down to when the movie was about to come

1102
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:24,240
out and um and and you know this is not

1103
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,880
to say that the formula is bad NE sure

1104
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,520
um

1105
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,440
the um first ad that the studio wanted

1106
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,680
to put out for spinal

1107
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:40,880
tap was basically a u to put it

1108
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:43,000
charitably an adaptation of the ad for

1109
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,960
airplane the ad for airplane had an

1110
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,599
airplane fuselage tied into a knot the

1111
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,240
wanted to do had the the neck of a

1112
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,599
guitar tied into a knot ah of course and

1113
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,920
said you can't do

1114
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:59,680
that um but they wanted to sell it as if

1115
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,359
was the the going commercial formula of

1116
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,240
the time even though it wasn't uh that's

1117
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,839
how hard it is even when you've gotten

1118
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,280
to make the thing that's not in the

1119
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:12,040
formula they want to try to convince the

1120
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:15,160
audience that it no it really is yeah um

1121
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,240
so it's that's ever new is just to go

1122
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,240
against that you

1123
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,440
know um I feel like I've gotten down us

1124
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,480
down to dark path so let's go back real

1125
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,240
quick to either either maybe another

1126
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,559
Comedy album that you loved a hell we

1127
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,680
can talk about freeberg again I don't

1128
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,480
care we can talk about what I I am just

1129
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,839
curious a bit more about your influences

1130
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:39,720
because you're one of the you know I'll

1131
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:43,000
give you the other one yeah um which is

1132
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,880
um which is amazing and I I amazed a

1133
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,920
friend of mine by playing a couple of

1134
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,280
tracks from it uh maybe six months ago

1135
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,760
and said guess when this was made he

1136
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:58,079
couldn't even get within a decade or two

1137
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,960
of imagining it was made in 19 59 and it

1138
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,359
was

1139
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,240
uh I forget what the original name of

1140
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,920
the record is um it's most of it has

1141
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,119
been gathered on the best of sellers um

1142
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,440
Peter Sellers but the original record is

1143
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,960
is called something else anyway there

1144
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,440
are are two pieces that stand out um

1145
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,710
that are just

1146
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,440
astonishing um and again

1147
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:27,119
[Music]

1148
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,720
um the production that's what my friend

1149
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,640
couldn't believe was was the lushness

1150
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:35,480
and the Grandeur of the production which

1151
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,799
was done by a certain Mr George

1152
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,280
Martin oh yes right I'd forgotten he did

1153
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:45,160
those albums before yeah okay yeah yeah

1154
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,720
that's one of the reasons that um and

1155
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,280
the the two

1156
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,280
pieces they're

1157
00:50:50,760 --> 00:51:02,160
um one was a supposed film tour of a um

1158
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:05,440
un relatively unimpressive neighborhood

1159
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,520
of South London called balum but it was

1160
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:12,319
done as if by

1161
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:16,240
Americans and Peter sers does this Great

1162
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:20,720
fake American narrator balham gateway to

1163
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:24,640
the South and um it's just this

1164
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,400
wonderful silly travelog of nowhere uh

1165
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,480
done in this uh Broad American fake

1166
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,480
American approach but with great music

1167
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,839
um great sound effects Peter does all

1168
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:39,359
the voices all the characters and um

1169
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:44,839
that's a and then

1170
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:47,319
B is a piece called so little time um he

1171
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:49,839
plays Nancy and I don't remember her

1172
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:51,119

BBC and she's interviewing a guy very

1175
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,799

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,599
kid who's been chosen to be a rock and

1185
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,400

fabulous and it's you know it's about

1189
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,319
that era of rock and roll where people

1190
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,720
would pluck you know so unlike today

1191
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:45,440
where people would pluck kids

1192
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,280
with mini min minim minimal talent and

1193
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,000

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,799
Unforgettable stuff I'm going to have to

1216
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,440

many notes and I'm half half proud of

1222
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:10,839
myself for not bringing up the stuff

1223
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,599
that you get have to talk about every

1224
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:14,640
time you're interviewed but I I am just

1225
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:16,240
looking here very quick you know I do

1226
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,000
want to ask you only because it's on my

1227
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,520
mind and I have been interviewing Phil

1228
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,480
Proctor basically one album by album by

1229
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,520
album for fire sign about the

1230
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,520
production um when did you first hear

1231
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:33,440
fire sign

1232
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:37,240
well um I heard before fire sign F

1233
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,880
me Peter had a a radio show on kpfk in

1234
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,319
Los Angeles the radio station of the

1235
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,480
trites and the

1236
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,000
stalinists depending depending on which

1237
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,799
year you were listening it was one one

1238
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,799
of the other um called Radio free Oz

1239
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:58,000
yeah with um Paul J

1240
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:59,960
Robbins and um so I'd listened to that

1241
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,280
this was what before I got back into a

1242
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,760
show business I was teaching school and

1243
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:08,760
I thought found it a fairly mesmerizing

1244
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:11,920
show um to to plant this in time they

1245
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,920
ended each show with a

1246
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:20,960
Raga tonight's Raga is tonight's raaga

1247
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,280
um and then

1248
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,640
um fairly soon after fire sign started

1249
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:30,880
doing a show on

1250
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:34,000
kpfk and fairly soon after The

1251
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:37,839
credibility gap started doing our show

1252
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,799
on krla we were on am they were on FM

1253
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:44,760
and I realized that our our Fates would

1254
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:49,599
be somehow intertwined when a

1255
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:52,839
u Christmas one year a uh guy from

1256
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:56,680
Chicago came out and wrote a

1257
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:58,960
review of our radio show very nice

1258
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,720

Nichols and Elaine May I've got a very

1282
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,400
strange wall of record

1283
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,480
stuff now Have you listened to their

1284
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,839
records lately oh uh it's been I would

1285
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,240
say maybe a year but not that long it's

1286
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:08,640
amazing how much of their material has

1287
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:12,000
to do with psychoanalysis oh yeah and

1288
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:15,000
how and how that dates no that is true I

1289
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,240
mean there's yeah and I say that as a

1290
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,480
fan but I went back and listen to it

1291
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,599
about a year ago and I just was stunned

1292
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,520
at oh my God this is all about life on a

1293
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:27,559
you know this is all about shrink World

1294
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:30,559
M I've also got my wall one piece I'm

1295
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:32,400
very proud of which is the only comedy

1296
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,880
bootleg this bootleg company ever did

1297
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,760
and it's a Groucho bootleg oh yeah it's

1298
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,720
it's the weirdest maybe kind of super

1299
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,680
ugly cover but it's the only comedy

1300
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:44,599
bootleg these guys ever did in the 70s

1301
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,039
and it's it's what's on it is Radio uh

1302
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,599
no it's it's actually I think it's

1303
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:50,319
mostly hijack clips from movies uh maybe

1304
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,280
one or two I don't think they did any I

1305
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,799
think yeah I think it's just mostly

1306
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,599
movies not the boring stuff um cuz

1307
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:57,160
there's just bits and pieces there are

1308
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,319
there are some compilation albums that

1309
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:02,240
you can get that's got stuff from uh um

1310
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,920
oh my God his talk his his game show

1311
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,799
which is now escaping thank you you bet

1312
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,680
your life so it's got weird random

1313
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:09,079
things it's they call it the Marx

1314
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,920
Brothers but it's mostly just Groucho

1315
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:14,160
being silly uh but it's a good one um

1316
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,319
well well that you know that was really

1317
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,839
interesting because people

1318
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:21,119
assumed that the Marx Brothers in the

1319
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:22,680
movies were basically I mean there were

1320
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,599
a lot of really good comedy writers who

1321
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,920
wrote those movies and so it was sort of

1322
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:31,520
a leap

1323
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:33,760
for uh you to see grouo in that in that

1324
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,079
late uh in his career later in his

1325
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,480
career game show context and realize um

1326
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,240
this is him ad

1327
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,240
living he's he's a funny he's a funny

1328
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,480
[ __ ] even without those those

1330
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,039
God I love and it's and there's always

1331
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,760
of course that just that little twinkle

1332
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,480
where you can tell he's a bit of a perve

1333
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,119
but not in a gross way like he's just

1334
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,280
he's a dirty old man but in the most

1335
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,880
delightful way possible yeah um well

1336
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,680
