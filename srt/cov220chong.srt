uhuh um okay so I wantan to I you know

38
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,360
what let's let's start here I don't know

39
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,759
I I know the only part I really know

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
about your history is you know that you

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,240
started out as a musician obviously

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,719
there's a lot more to your life than

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,280
that you started out as a musician and

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,560
eventually you meet cheich Marin and it

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,719
seems like that's history but what were

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,079
your comedy influences early on if you

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,960
were a musician

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,039
first well my earliest comedy influence

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,920
was red fox when I was really young we

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,040
used to go to this dump uh it was an AR

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,040
like an army base was a like a dump they

52
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,239
never had back in the 40s and 50s they

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,040
never really had uh kind of garbage

54
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,519
collection they just had a dump that you

55
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,920
would take and dump all your stuff there

56
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,599
and and we found you know did scavenge

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,280
around there and I found a red fox uh

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,840
party record they called the 78 yeah and

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,319
that was a that was my first taste of

60
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,480
recorded comedy and and we couldn't play

61
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,800
it in front of our parents but sure when

62
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,800
we played it it was it was very x-rated

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,200
and and and and so much fun and so red

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,319
pox was really was my earliest uh and

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:01,599
and plus uh like I grew up uh in the 40s

66
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:04,720
50s so we had radio uh you know the Amos

67
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,000
and Andy and Jack Benny and Bob Hope and

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,120
so I'd listen to the radio shows yeah

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,720
and I'd hear the comedians uh you know

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,239
all the Comedians and then R and then Ed

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:18,000
Sullivan so so and my Dad loved to you

72
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,799
know he loved to be funny he loved to

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,120
laugh it was a we I grew up in a very

74
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:29,200
comic uh driven uh childhood yeah now at

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,920
at that time so I mean I know you're

76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
born in Canada you're you're in Canada

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,640
at the time though when you find that

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,319
record yeah yeah I'm in Calgary Calgary

79
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,040
Alberta Calgary Alberta okay and so was

80
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,680
there I mean it's funny because every

81
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,760
influence you listed that I heard was

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,519
was was American were there any was

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,360
there any Canadian comedy to speak of

84
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,439
that you knew about there was a a pair

85
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,079
of guys called Wayne and Schuster oh

86
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,640
yeah sure they Wayne and Schuster they

87
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,480
were the hot funniest comedians that

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,280
Canada had you know had that like Martin

89
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,000
and Lewis who was Wayne and Schuster and

90
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,000
and I think the daughter I think Rose

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,959
went on to become a big uh uh well-known

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,959
producer okay you know I think she was

93
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,919
on the the

94
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,560
um uh what's that show at night uh

95
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,160
Saturday Night Live I think she was one

96
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,000
of the original writers I'm not sure wow

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,560
okay all right so that's all right that

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
see that's this is one of those things

99
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,440
it's where I think if if you if you grew

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,039
up in Canada at a certain time it seems

101
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,360
like it it depends on when you grew up

102
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,800
there your influences could be heavily

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,000
American regardless um oh yeah yeah or

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
european sure European you know anybody

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,360
like like bville was still happening you

106
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,120
know when I grew up sure and so so so

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,039
there was uh you know anybody that was

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,039
on Ed Sullivan was from Vaudeville and

109
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,280
the thing is about Vaudeville like I

110
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:59,160
went to the Crazy Horse Saloon in in

111
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,320
France when we shot a movie here in 1980

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,520
and the Horse Saloon would have these

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,400
Comics they were like MIM artist because

114
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,800
no one spoke you know a Common Language

115
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,280
and so they'd have to be funny with

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,600
movement you know like Charlie Chapman

117
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,560
and uh and so I I I picked up a lot of

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,000
influence uh from from uh the VOD

119
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,520
villian Comics yeah that's see that's

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,440
that's amazing and and was that okay uh

121
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,120
was that influence laying dormant as

122
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,960
you're a musician or were you doing

123
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,400
anything comedically before chich and

124
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,919
Chong well when you're a musician in a

125
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,639
black band which I was you're in a

126
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,960
constant state of humor uhhuh you know

127
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,759
you're you're just laughing all the time

128
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,080
because we would you

129
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,039
know play the dozens you know without

130
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,199
out each other you know and whether you

131
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,520
want it to be or not like when I joined

132
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,600
when I was with Motown my nickname was

133
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,680

138
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,400

139
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,080

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:08,319
you know I realized every move that I

183
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,039
made was because I was fired or kicked

184
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,240
out of somewhere like we got kicked we

185
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,080
had we started the band in Calvary and

186
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,759
then the mayor and the in the chief of

187
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,120
police actually kicked us out of out of

188
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:24,599
the out of Calgary oh God we were asked

189
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,280
to leave during the Christmas rush and

190
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,120
we were glad to leave and then when I

191
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,519
was in out in Vancouver after the gigs

192
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,800
ran out because we were sort you know we

193
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,800
weren in't a professional band we were

194
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,760
like a bunch of guys throwing together

195
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,560
that could play rock and roll so we had

196
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,360
no idea about the the touring uh you

197
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,320
know what you how you tour different we

198
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,080
never had an agent okay right we would

199
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,200
just get gigs and then when the gigs

200
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,880
were finished like uh little daddy you

201
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,760
know we we broke up because we never had

202
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,040
any work ahead of us and so we're so

203
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,040
used to all us are so used to being fir

204
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,040
that we just got fired ourselves and and

205
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,760
so I ended up uh you know going back and

206
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,200
then I ended up so uh I got fired from

207
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,320
mtown that was my latest one after I

208
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,360
rode a hit hit song for them I got fired

209
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,040
because I had to get a green card and

210
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,399
and uh the tour manager didn't know what

211
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,120
that meant and so oh no when I missed a

212
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,640
gig when I missed a gig he fired me and

213
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,640
even though mtown was paying for it but

214
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,079
when I got fired I stayed fired I went

215
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,600
back to Vancouver and I started a

216
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:40,680
theater company uh in a strip joint and

217
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,880
and then we had a another actor like me

218
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,079
long here and then we had a straight guy

219
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,079
and then our straight guy's wife found

220
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,800
out what he was doing and so she fired

221
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,760
him and then that's when I met cheich

222
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,160
cheich was in Vancouver he was avoiding

223
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,200
the draft and he was also uh uh looking

224
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,880
for a job and so when I met him

225
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,920
uh I hired him at first as a writer and

226
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,760
as an actor writer actor well everybody

227
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
was writer actors you know there was

228
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,279
that's the way it was and so and then

229
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,240
when we got fired from my brother my

230
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,040
brother fired us because we had played

231
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,680
out our our string in in Vancouver we

232
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,720
started attracting the

233
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,079
non-drinkers and for a bar that's death

234
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,079
you know because they take up room that

235
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,680
the alcoholics need you know to spend

236
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,760
all their paycheck yeah and so I we got

237
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,720
fired from there and so then teach and I

238
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,200
came to LA to make it as Comedians and

239
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,480
that's how we did it and so you're at

240
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,959
the club and you just needed some

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
entertainment and you figured why not

242
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,839
comedy is was it that simple or was it a

243
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,240
little more involved than that no it was

244
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,480
the strip club and and the girls would

245
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,920
come on with these elaborate costumes

246
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,519
and and and I noticed that crowd really

247
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,279
wasn't interested in the show sure they

248
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,200
were just they like the at osphere and

249
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,720
and the girls would get on stage and get

250
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,360
naked and and and it wasn't really a

251
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,839
show it was just a like a party where

252
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,440
chicks got naked okay and uh and so I

253
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,959
decided that and we had a singer and we

254
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,440
had a tap dancer you know MC in the show

255
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,360
but no one was watching them and so I

256
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,639
when I came home without a band I

257
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,079
started working the lights and writing

258
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,560
shows and then I realized hey I could

259
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,639
write a show with the strippers because

260
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,360
I noticed that they were so beautiful

261
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,920
when they before they got into their

262
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,639
costumes and so I wrote a uh the first

263
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,320
show was about after the show and we're

264
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,160
having a pajama party at one of the

265
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,399
girls' house and and so the girls would

266
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,519
come in their street clothes one by one

267
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,240
and then they would undress and get into

268
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,000
their pajamas or their little um sexy uh

269
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,920
what are they call I forget what they

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,959
night gown sure okay and uh and then

271
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,200
Taps would come over with Genie the sing

272
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,560
and they would say hey that was a great

273
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,600
night we had tonight hey Taps why don't

274
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,360
you show us that that dance you did that

275
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,639
was amazing so Taps would do his dance

276
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,120
and then now the whole crowd is looking

277
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,360
at him and he was so good that he he got

278
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,160
a non-core and so he had to do uh two

279
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,959
acts wow and at the end of the show that

280
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,920
night he quit because he wasn't hired to

281
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,920
to do his act he he just wanted to be

282
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,480
the

283
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,079
MC and not do anything and so uh you

284
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,560
know we lost our entertainment and so I

285
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,440
talked to the the doorman who was you

286
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,880
got a Dave Graham he was very funny guy

287
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,440
and so I said I wanted him to take over

288
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,000
Taps this place and so uh David said I

289
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,199
will I'll do it if you do it he put it

290
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,440
on me and so I said oh okay so we became

291
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,560
a a comedy team uh uh David Graham and

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
myself and then we uh and and then the

293
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,440
rest was history we started doing

294
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,880
improvisational uh comedy and we just

295
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,720
never looked back and when chich and I

296
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,160
joined up all we we did the same bits

297
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,320
you know that we would do uh in the show

298
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,720
and uh only cheich and I did them you

299
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,600
know back to back and uh and we tried it

300
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,959
out in in Vancouver at a at a battle of

301
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,880
the bands and we actually won the

302
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,440
contest without playing a note it was

303
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,320
just teach and I doing comedy oh my God

304
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,240
and so we knew we knew then that I and

305
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,399
and I knew you know I'd been through the

306
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,639
Motown School of Hard KNX and so I knew

307
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,399
what it took you know and two guys

308
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,079
without instruments you know can make a

309
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:48,720
lot of money more than a a band with a

310
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:50,959
ton of uh expenses right wow so you

311
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,360
essentially do this weird thing where

312
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,880
you invent an artsy form of of burlesque

313
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
basically like that's kind of what

314
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,240
happened and then you just yeah it

315
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,240
doesn't fall into your lap but you must

316
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,680
have felt like you had an aptitude for

317
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,079
making comedy and then you meet the guy

318
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,800
who who just is a perfect compliment to

319
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,399
your work what was the material like

320
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,199
then is there anything like it on any of

321
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,480
your albums or was it totally different

322
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,839
what was the act like not a whole lot

323
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,360
nothing on the albums no what happened

324
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,920
when we were playing for uh you know

325
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,320
bikers's trip clubs we would torture the

326
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,360
bikers you know we would do some very

327
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,680
classical bits and and you know bikers

328
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,480
expecting hard or strippers and they

329
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,800
would get uh like we had a mime artist

330
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,839
we had a classical guitarist and the

331
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,279
mime artist would come out and pretend

332
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,440
he's picking flowers and then we had

333
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,279
Dave would come out pretend to sing a

334
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,160
very classical song and then I would

335
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,320
start the humor by coming out to a door

336
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,720
pretending that I was half asleep with a

337
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,440
rolled up newspaper and and stripped to

338
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,720
the waist and it looked like I and I'd

339
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,040
walk over to Dave and I'd beat him beat

340
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,000
him or both the head with a new

341
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,079
newspaper saying what kind of [ __ ]

342
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,240
song is that and and that would start

343
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,360
the humor and then we would go into uh

344
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,639
all sorts of humor so but our our

345
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,920
material was more tits and ass you know

346
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,320
sex a lot of sex jokes in fact we got a

347
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,120
lot of material from the Playboy joke

348
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,160
column okay we would act out act out

349
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:27,440
their jokes you know and and so when CH

350
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,639
and I ended up in La uh the only common

351
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,040
denominator was getting hot smoking dope

352
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,600
that was the one thing everybody related

353
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,720
to and then plus the fact chich was uh

354
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,120
Latino you know Mexican and Cho and so

355
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,480
we added the Cho uh character and the

356
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,240
stoner character and that really

357
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,759
resonated with the world and then when

358
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,480
we did Up in Smoke that really cemented

359
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,279
it yeah you know I mean that was that

360
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,079
was the really the birth of chiching

361
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,279
Chong that's so that's so crazy what was

362
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,240
your experience I know you might not be

363
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,800
able to speak to ch's experience but

364
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,240
what was your experience with improv was

365
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,360
it just like a necessity you're just

366
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,519
like I'll figure it out as I go along or

367
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,279
did you have any experience with it no

368
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,000
other than watching it but you know

369
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,519
being a musician you know and a lot of

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,079
the Improv actors that I met over the

371
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,000
years most of them were had Music

372
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,959
Experience okay because what you learn

373
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,959
in music is is you learn how to uh how

374
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:30,240
to uh uh improvise you know you get a

375
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,040
theme and and then you improvise off

376
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,160
that theme sure or or then you create a

377
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,399
new uh a new uh uh song you know and so

378
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,839
jokes are Just Like Music you know

379
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,880
there's a beginning a middle and an end

380
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,600
and you know you have a punchline and

381
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,079
then you can uh uh you know then you go

382
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,720
on to the next set you know so I wrote I

383
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,040
would write a set like I would do a

384
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,759
music set you know different different

385
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,720
songs but we it would be comedy yeah

386
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,839
different comedy bits and so I just use

387
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,280
my musical uh training and and the

388
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,199
comedy it's all about timing and and uh

389
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,160
I had a natural thing for it and so did

390
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,839
cheich you know because cheich would

391
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,280
entertain his family I would I I was a a

392
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,600
watcher I when I was playing on the chin

393
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,839
circuit they always had a black comic

394
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,120
open opening sure yeah you know the

395
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:27,360
black uh the you know the black clubs I

396
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,440
always had comics and MC's you know

397
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,960
people that would talk to the crowd you

398
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,480
know not like uh you know anab was very

399
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,440
hip yeah and like red fox and that it's

400
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
like it is today you know like Chris

401
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,960
it'll be like Chris Rock going on before

402
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,000
the before the strippers you know and

403
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,600
and doing his bit and so I I was uh

404
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,080
lucky enough to to be part of that world

405
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,360
earlier you know in the early early 60s

406
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,080
the late 50s and early 60s and so I had

407
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,440
that ability uh you know to entertain

408
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,880
and uh and and that's that's really what

409
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,720
uh got us the kind of success that we

410
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,480
ended up doing that's crazy that's H

411
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,720
that I I love hearing stories when

412
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,880
people don't intend to get into comedy

413
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,559
and yet all they turns out all they got

414
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,200
to do is try a little hard at comedy and

415
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,240
they're just great at it I mean that's

416
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,280
one of the it's great I love stories

417
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,280
like that well my you know my early

418
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,240
training I played guitar when I was

419
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,840
eight years old and I used to play with

420
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,679
a a f fiddle player I was I played with

421
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,919
them for about 8 9 10 11

422
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:39,960
12 years old and I was background guitar

423
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,159
or or uh what do you call second guitar

424
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,440
you know Rhythm rhythm

425
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,520
guitar and he told me right from the

426
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,720
beginning keep it simple you would say

427
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,840
keep it simple and give the people what

428
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:57,120
they want you know and so I just used

429
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,080
that Creed through my life and it always

430
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,760
worked yeah you know because the simpler

431
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,280
that chich and Chong became the more

432
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,320
basic we were the more popular we became

433
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,159
sure because everybody understand simple

434
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,960
you know uh the intellectuals and the

435
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,960
and and the people that aren't so smart

436
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,200
you know yeah and the trouble that I saw

437
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,200
with some some of these more

438
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,120
intellectual intelligent comedians is

439
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,400
that they they're they're cracking you

440
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,360
know themselves up but they're leaving a

441
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,240
lot of audience in the dark you know not

442
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,080
knowing

443
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,760
you what they're talking about

444
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,440
sure whereas When U te and Chong you

445
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,039
know there was never a doubt as to what

446
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,039
we were trying to say you know yeah well

447
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,159
I mean I I would argue that at the very

448
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,600
least though that doesn't that doesn't

449
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,280
exclude the any of your your comedy that

450
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,799
also kind of got deep whether or not the

451
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,520
the material was I mean you guys were

452
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,480
saying some I don't know you maybe I

453
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,200
mean do you think you were saying

454
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
anything daring cuz I mean you're pretty

455
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,039
anti

456
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
you

457
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:06,960
know well it's not so much

458
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:11,799
anti-authority as it is pro hipness yeah

459
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:15,480
okay it's it's something that uh um you

460
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:18,760
know to me you know

461
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,320
anti-authority I I look at this people

462
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,280
you know and and it's been my experience

463
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,440
that it's better to be friends with

464
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,039
those guys than it is to piss them off

465
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,080
sure

466
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,960
you know so I I had a lot of police uh

467
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:39,400
uh we we do chich ch's dad was a cop

468
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,919
uhuh he was like a a he taught uh law

469
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:46,000
enforcement he was right up there and so

470
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:49,840
chich was raised by a a serious uh uh

471
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,240
policeman and so cops became our big

472
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,039
fans you know because we never we never

473
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,080
were anti- anything we were just proot

474
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,720
okay all right I I get that again so

475
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,400
even even if you're doing like stadanko

476
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,240
I guess he's not even the bad guy in

477
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,480
that sketch he's just kind of

478
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,360
boring well he he just had to learn yeah

479
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,279
you know what he did in the movie the

480
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,240
great thing about Chichi Chong movies is

481
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:20,559
that nobody got hurt and and and nobody

482
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,600
uh got killed and nobody uh um uh you

483
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,679
know we we never tried to turn anybody

484
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,799
into drug addicts you know right we we

485
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,679
were just trying to get do our life it

486
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:34,840
was like a day in the life of a couple

487
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,799
of Stoners you know sure well I and

488
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,840
which is I mean I I think maybe I don't

489
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,440
know I'm trying to think of what my

490
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,039
favorite part of your albums is because

491
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,919
that's the stuff I grew up on for the

492
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,200
most part and I oh yeah I grew up with

493
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,679
it late you know this is stuff my

494
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,000
parents owned and passed on to me um and

495
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,520
and I and you're curious and sure you're

496
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,120
a writer I guess yeah so you had to you

497
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,559
had to uh experience or you have to

498
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,679
learn about everything exactly and so

499
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:06,360
when you're yeah when your friends would

500
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,400
talk about chichin Chong you had to go

501
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,279
check it out you know and then when you

502
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,640
were ready for that kind of information

503
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,760
uh you would understand it as they grew

504
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,000
as you Grew Older I think that's true

505
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,360
well you know what's funny is I will

506
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,120
I'll say at the very least we were super

507
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,440
proud my best friend and I became best

508
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,840
friends over uh weird owl's music and

509
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,200
over your comedy and uh we were the

510
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,320
first kids in the neighborhood to

511
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,120
discover chichin Chong so we but what's

512
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,120
funny is we're probably the last kids in

513
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,240
that town to ever smoke pot I'm almost

514
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,240
certain of that which is funny because

515
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,720
you know but that never mattered to us I

516
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,880
think it was just like how good your

517
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,559
comedy was you know the the characters

518
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,919
you

519
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,400
know yeah yeah I mean it was uh we had

520
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,720
so much fun doing it because we were

521
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,480
always stoned but not you know not just

522
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,039
bloto Stone we'd get high enough to

523
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,080
appreciate what we were doing yeah and

524
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,679
and so we would have more fun listening

525
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,000
to their albums I think than the

526
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,520
audience

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,279
did because we would just I mean we

528
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,760
would create it and then sit back and

529
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,400
listen over and over and over again and

530
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,200
and then we would say oh well we got to

531
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,320
fix this and make this a little better

532
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,360
and that a little better and it was

533
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,440
always done for love Yeah chich Chong

534
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,720
everything we did was for the love of

535
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,880
humor it wasn't for them you know

536
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,880
thinking well CBS will buy this or or uh

537
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,000
you know oh this will be you know we can

538
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,760
do this you know we're clean we never

539
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,039
thought about being clean or dirty we

540
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,320
just thought about being funny yeah well

541
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,840
and that's what's funny is that then

542
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,600
people like myself can come along and

543
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,720
say man you took all these Chances with

544
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,799
language when it's like no this is what

545
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,799
we thought worked right yeah exactly

546
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,360
sometimes it's hard guys like myself

547
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,120
tend to get up our own ass when we're

548
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,640
when we're thinking about stuff we love

549
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,440
you know so I so I well yeah well well

550
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,159
you guys are analytical you know and and

551
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,720
you know the rules and and and and

552
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,360
that's why you enjoy it more because

553
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,960
then you understand exactly what rules

554
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,720
were breaking you know right and then

555
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,720
you yeah then you understand what rules

556
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,360
are really full of [ __ ] you know what

557
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,159
are real that's exactly true I you know

558
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,159
I I think one of the things that's

559
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,520
inspired me the most is you know I when

560
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,840
I made my first comedy album I was 19

561
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,159
and my favorite thing was cutting

562
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,880
together all the sound effects and doing

563
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,880
all that [ __ ] myself and I know you had

564
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,000
Lou but I was curious like what was the

565
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,120
production process like of those albums

566
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,720
because they are some of the best mixed

567
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,360
albums I've ever

568
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,559
heard well exactly what you what you

569
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,919
said what we did uh Lou would only get

570
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,880
the product after we had it how nailed

571
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,919
down basically okay and then we'd send

572
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,360
it to Lou then we'd send it to Lou and

573
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,600
he'd give me his notes he'd F me in the

574
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,200
middle of the night and give me his

575
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,480
notes and then we always gave him the

576
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,159
bits to do the music chich and I never

577
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:04,080
did the music louther that was his

578
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,600
expertise sure okay and so and so uh

579
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,480
that was that was our uh uh method but

580
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,120
te and I always you know we we were the

581
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,200
ones that did the sound effects and we

582
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,039
had fun doing them you know we knew

583
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
where to put them and how to put them

584
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,360
and then and then we played played with

585
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,720
him you know the sound and everything we

586
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,120
had the best time man I didn't know you

587
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,080
did the sound effects yourself that

588
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,720
changes things so much for me to be

589
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,520
alone

590
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,600
huh I sorry I just didn't know you did

591
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,880
the sound effects yourself that that

592
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,279
kind of just blew my mind that blew the

593
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,039
[ __ ] out of my mind sorry for the

594
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,960
language but holy [ __ ] that's amaz so

595
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,320
what were you uh I guess let's get a

596
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,200
little technical what were you carrying

597
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,440
around were you going around to places

598
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,559
or were you doing all the effects in a

599
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,640
studio sometimes we would uh you know

600
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:54,600
like when we did the drive-in bit we

601
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,320
went to a a drive-in movie theater last

602
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,480
one in LA and we recorded us driving

603
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,520
over the bumps MH uh we recorded that

604
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,360
sound and then uh uh like gunshots for

605
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,279
instance we would get the the the

606
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,880
security guard at A&M records and we'd

607
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,320
get him to fire his gun off in a in a

608
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,960
bucket of sand or something oh my

609
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,000
God just to get the sound and if we

610
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,840
needed streets that was easy if we

611
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,919
needed uh uh kids I had all my my kids

612
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,159
and they would get their friends and we

613
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,720
would all end up in a studio

614
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,360
you know uh making sound effects and

615
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,399
singing and that and my like one time

616
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,720
the tortured old man bit uh we needed a

617
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:42,520
a woman screaming and so that was my

618
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,320
wife Shelby we had her in the studio we

619
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,080
want her to scream she screamed and yeah

620
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,000
we had so much fun you know it was just

621
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,039
uh if we could go back to those times I

622
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,720
I'd go back in a minute but yeah

623
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,799
unfortunately unfortunately we got bit

624
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,880
by the movie bug and when you get

625
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,960
when you start doing movies it's it's

626
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,480
the ultimate you can't you physically

627
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,600
can't go back you know sure well I mean

628
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,360
at the very least we've got this example

629
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,480
of a bunch of albums that have I think a

630
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,039
lot of heart and obviously obviously a

631
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,080
lot of work went into them that uh are

632
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,600
going to stand the test of time at least

633
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,279
even in terms of just the technical

634
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,360
stuff like I it's you know I think you

635
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,679
could just listen to those for the

636
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,120
technical stuff and be really heavily

637
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,960
involved in it yeah you're into that

638
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,279
that thing and and now you know I think

639
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,480
one of the

640
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:39,080
the biggest accomplishments is that

641
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,200
we've influence so many artists you know

642
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,559
like Quinton Tarantino he's a big

643
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,519
chichin Chong fan yeah and you can see

644
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,080
our our mark on his all his movies you

645
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,320
know they always had this CH Chong sort

646
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,760
of attitude yeah uh in them and then

647
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,440
we've influenced like Howard Stern you

648
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,039
know Howard Stern was like you he'd grew

649
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,480
up on our albums and so he he he went

650
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:06,880
right right to the you know right to the

651
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:10,000
hardcore uh hardcore uh you know radio

652
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,880
stuff yeah and

653
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,679
um do you and what else was I gonna say

654
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,120
I'm sorry go ahead no no no uh well I

655
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,399
was actually gonna ask you of your

656
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,399
albums do you have a favorite

657
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:26,679
one uh not really not really they all

658
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,120
they all they all sort of let's see

659
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:32,279
favorite albums probably the first one

660
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,120
yeah you know yeah because that that was

661
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:37,399
such a milestone you know that first

662
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,519
album represented uh all our struggles

663
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,840
you know trying to make it I mean CH and

664
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,240
I you know we struggled for about two

665
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,519
years and it was a struggle you know

666
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,200
when you try to support your family or

667
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:51,760
two families in my case you know uh

668
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,760
luckily both of my women

669
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,000
worked you know they had jobs and and so

670
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,559
chich and I we just did the couch you

671
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,679
know sleeping on Friends couches and uh

672
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,240
putting up with you know three dog night

673
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,120
really helped too because they were uh

674
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,480
the drummer Floyd is a brother-in-law of

675
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,279
mine married to I was married to his

676
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,240
sister she was my first wife and so they

677
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,200
have they opened a few doors for us you

678
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,240
know but uh all in all it was it was

679
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,000
just a labor of of love the whole the

680
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,640
whole trip yeah and and that whole time

681
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,679
that you were waiting for that to happen

682
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,600
uh was it just doing Club gigs or

683
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,840
opening for ACT everything we could go

684
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,480
everything you could get okay everything

685
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,279
we can get they never had comedy clubs

686
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,279
in and so we would go to the black clubs

687
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,600
and then they would hire us you know for

688
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:47,360
25 bucks or 50 bucks you know some real

689
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,880
cheap price and uh and we could rely on

690
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,080
them you know and that's what kept us

691
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,120
alive for for a year two two years you

692
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,559
know we and we do any freebies that we

693
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,880
could do and then we you know we

694
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:03,480
couldn't go on the road because we were

695
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,159
uh you know saddled with the family but

696
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,760
uh we could stay in town and then and

697
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,559
then but it was a recording soon as we

698
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,200
did Dave's not here then we got jumped

699
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:16,240
into that upper you know upper echelon

700
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,519
of of Comedy yeah know because when you

701
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,720
have an usually you're in comedy for

702
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,840
years before you do an album and but

703
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,279
chich and I were we were only in it for

704
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,760
maybe a year before we started doing uh

705
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,000
recordings wow and the way we did it you

706
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,399
know most ComEd comedians you know they

707
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,600
record their act right their live act

708
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,080
right but we were we were opposite we

709
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:42,120
recorded an album you know and it was

710
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,240
all about uh it was all about uh uh you

711
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,600
know being being hippies in this you

712
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,080
know in the 70s that's what it was all

713
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,200
about and drugs anything to do with

714
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,360
drugs you we we cornered the market on

715
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,279
that and then we did kind of material

716
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,360
that you know that only kids could

717
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,639
understand you know they couldn't play

718
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,159
it for their parents right although some

719
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:08,159
did sure you know a lot did and uh and

720
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:12,840
then if you do anything forbidden that's

721
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,440
another key to success you know yeah I I

722
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,240
I mean I love that you're able to break

723
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,760
it down so succinctly about what worked

724
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,559
about your comedy that's kind of great

725
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,840
to me I mean it's it's it seems it seems

726
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,120
simple but at the same time obviously it

727
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,200
wouldn't have worked if you guys didn't

728
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,960
have this huge love for writing sketch

729
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,480
comedy which is a thing I don't get to

730
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,360
see as much

731
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,880
anymore yeah yeah it sort of faded it

732
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,519
faded away you know like the committee

733
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,279
had a movie out and I don't think it

734
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,679
even got got distribution uh yeah people

735
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:44,679
people forget you know and then the

736
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,080
comedians they copy like the Sam

737
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:52,000
Kennison model that's all that's out you

738
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,080
know sure now you know and uh oh

739
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,559

00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:03,080
black black guy he's he's doing that

742
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,159
sort of like train of thought oh sure

743
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,360
Gerard

744
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,559
carmichel yeah yeah okay yeah like he's

745
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,960
he's carrying on that tradition yeah you

746
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:14,639
know Steve Martin you know his style is

747
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,639
gone we haven't seen that you know wild

748
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:20,120
and crazy guy uh model

749
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,320
anymore uh you know like I said

750
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,880
kennethon Andrew Dice he has to change

751
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,840
his act kind of sure you know you can't

752
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,440
rely on you see you can't get you can

753
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:35,600
what what you do you you raise a crop of

754
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,039
of admirers and it's an age thing and

755
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,440
when they grow out of you then it's time

756
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,799
to move on because you got to make way

757
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,399
for the new com Comics coming up that

758
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,519
have their audience yeah but you still

759
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,120
so yeah it's always a system yeah you

760
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:51,480
still got a pretty DieHard fan base

761
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,600
though and very least you get to perform

762
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,639
for them you know on occasion right I

763
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,000
mean is what's that

764
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:01,720
like Yeah well yeah I mean over the

765
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,480
years you know I've developed uh just

766
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,080
myself you know teach too but I

767
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,320
developed like there was a uh what's it

768
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:14,279
called uh that 70 show

769
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,639
uh uh time you know period of my life

770
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,000
yeah yeah five years five years in my

771
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:22,240
life was the sub show six years you know

772
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and and so I got a lot of fans from that

773
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,880
sure then I got I got I got fans from

774
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,320
Dancing With the Stars you know all

775
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,320
right yeah

776
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,840
yeah millions of fans that just know me

777
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,080
as a dancer that's amazing and then you

778
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,480
know the old chich Chin chong fans you

779
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,279
know they see me go through all my

780
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:45,279
changes and so yeah we've managed to

781
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:48,320
stay uh pretty much relevant even to

782
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,960
today now I'm into the weed uh business

783
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,320
and which is so natural for me sure but

784
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,240
it's not something where I just put my

785
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,720
name on it and you know forget about it

786
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,159
but I go around and I I promote and then

787
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,440
and now I'm getting more into a uh heavy

788
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,960
uh spiritual side of it all and and like

789
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,040
I I just came back from uh uh Berlin and

790
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,639
and they had me do a little talk and and

791
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,040
the talk really was about how a

792
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,480
marijuana cures and and and the Cure

793
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,839
starts in the brain you know the brain

794
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,159
is the Central Command poost for for us

795
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,280
you know and it's the brain is also

796
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,119
where the soul is stored you know the

797
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,879
Consciousness is stored yeah and so I I

798
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:38,000
did a whole talk about how we are pure

799
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,599
Consciousness and therefore everybody is

800
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,440
relevant you know because everybody on

801
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:46,800
Earth is necessary to be here you know

802
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,919
yeah and uh and that's why you have to

803
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,240
respect everybody's uh Journey

804
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,639
regardless of what it is regardless of

805
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,680
it's Robin Banks or if it's uh uh you

806
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,560
know preaching to the to the

807
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:06,240
you know to the followers whatever it is

808
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:10,480
is uh is relevant yeah and you can't uh

809
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,800
you can't really make uh uh any kind of

810
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,960
uh distinction as to what is good what

811
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,560
is bad because every like I said

812
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,920
everything is relevant and the basis to

813
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,880
that is because we are Immortal beings

814
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,400
you know we've always been here we will

815
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,520
always be here and so all we're doing is

816
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,760
learning uh uh uh you know learning how

817
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:34,320
to live and we it takes a few lifetimes

818
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,320
to to learn say on Earth you know but

819
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,920
we're learning and uh some aren't you

820
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,680
know some are still in kindergarten and

821
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,720
some are uh you know in advanced uh

822
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,640
University you know but everybody has a

823
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,480
right to be here and everybody and no

824
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,000
one has the right to

825
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,599
criticize I like that I I like that and

826
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,079
I I like that we've actually kind of I

827
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:56,240
feel like that's that's been a theme

828
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,640
through what we've talked about this

829
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,960
whole time I mean like you gave me a

830
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,400
pretty good idea of of your own Journey

831
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,560
which has been I don't know insane like

832
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
filled with luck filled with Misfortune

833
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,359
but it's all led to stuff that you

834
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,760
learned how to appreciate exactly you

835
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:14,319
know like I said I got I got fired to to

836
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,520
every position in fact I rode a movie

837
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:20,200
one time called the Peter principal and

838
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:24,280
it was about two two two rocks fans who

839
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,839
sneak into an uh concert by pretending

840
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,160
the Ries and end up getting a job as

841
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:32,560
Ries but they're so inept that they keep

842
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,280
getting promoted instead of

843
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,319
fired like they drop equipment so they

844
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,839
oh take them off that put them in charge

845
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:44,119
of driving and then they show up late

846
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:46,760
you know and so they end up being uh

847
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,800
guitar texts and then they mess that up

848
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,599
and they end up performing yeah and they

849
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,000
end up becoming the star because they're

850
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,960
so inept to be doing anything else yeah

851
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,079
and that really is life you know that's

852
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,599
what we usually do we sort of like uh

853
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,800
and and and the only law of the universe

854
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:09,359
is karma which is a cause and effect

855
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,680
that's the only law you know if you uh

856
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,720
if you uh plant Bad Seeds you will

857
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,520
suffer if you plant good seeds you will

858
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,400
uh Prosper so that that really is the

859
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,400
simplest way to look at everything and

860
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,880
and but and the thing is that I have to

861
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,040
learn and that's why I said you know to

862
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,599
you uh you know just uh uh you know what

863
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,560
do you want to know because you can't

864
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:39,319
really tell people you can't give people

865
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,200
directions unless they ask for it yeah

866
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:42,440
you know what I'm saying sure I do and

867
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,359
that's really that's really what

868
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,040
preaching is all about you know if

869
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,440
someone comes to me and asks me like you

870
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,760
did I I I'll gladly give anything I know

871
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,040
but you know to to walk up to a stranger

872
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,800
or to someone that's on another path and

873
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,440
to start uh spoting my my uh

874
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,680
philosophies it's unw wanted and and it

875
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,680
wouldn't be learned it wouldn't be

876
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,200
accepted so that's what I learned you

877
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,200
know stay on your own tow that's what

878
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,520
the yoga say you know I I I like that a

879
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,079
lot and I like that I like knowing that

880
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,160
that guy that you that you're the guy

881
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,720
that's in your head that you are the guy

882
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,720
who created uh you know just some of my

883
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,599
favorite comedy of all time because you

884
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,319
you people can call it Stoner comedy if

885
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,839
they want I look at it again I might be

886
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:28,280
up my own ass about this but I look at

887
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,920
it a little more deeply than that I

888
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,319
think it's great character comedy uh

889
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,880
that happens to have pot in it and the

890
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:35,599
pot's fine if that's what brings you in

891
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,960
great but the character comedy is my

892
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,560
favorite part and it's obviously got the

893
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,880
heart of the two of you in it I really

894
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,920
do love that I yeah and and and it's

895
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,359
done with love yeah if you notice you

896
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,640
know we don't there's no hate there's no
