bodybuilder you're the one of the few

254
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,640
bodybuilders who can look in the mirror

255
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
and say look ma no steroids well I'm

256
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,880
really not a bodybuilder a wrestler

257
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
sorry sorry I do I do a lot of you know

258
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
weight training two three times a week I

259
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,399
do a lot of stretching you know I mean

260
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,639
uh you know bodybuilding has nothing to

261
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,120
do with wrestling right you know uh well

262
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,720
the best I've ever done I tell you this

263
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,399
is what no steroids none of this junk

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,480
was 465 pounds is the most I've ever

265
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,920
bench pressed but now that was at a body

266
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,560
weight of 240 lbs you know like some of

267
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,639
these guys now they got you know bench

268
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,680
pressing 600 lb but they weigh you know

269
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,920
500 lb and they can't walk up a flight

270
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,519
of steps so that's really not strength I

271
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,000
mean you need you know endurance and uh

272
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,200

you realize you look like John Wayne oh

441
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,080
that was 15 18 years ago my kids would

442
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,640
be watching old black and white movie on

443
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,080

Wayne movie being played uhhuh and that

446
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,400
uh that's when I first started realizing

447
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,360
that there was a resemblance when did

448
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,679
you start working as a lookalike about

449
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,799
eight years ago mhm approximately did

450
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,159
you practice or study like his voice and

451
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,600
mannerisms I never had to our characters

452
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,360
are that close together that uh I never

453
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,240
had to work on The Voice or the uh

454
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,400
particular looks it just I was lucky is

455
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,480
that right you you're you're it's all

456
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,120
natural what you do here yeah and you're

457
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,760

458
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,200

and I watched his movies and imitated

463
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:02,360
them then uh in my small style but uh

464
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,320
now to me it's a

465
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,679
responsibility kids nowadays don't have

466
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,840

467
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,480

497
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,000
Hollywood chaos where I play John Wayne

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,679
mhm that one had Humphrey Bogart Clark

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Gable and John Wayne in

500
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,320
it I mean that guy was quite an

501
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,640
imitator definitely

502
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,360
great how now you're with the lookalikes

503
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,360
of Minnesota yeah several agencies I not

504
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,120
exclusive with anybody but I uh

505
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:55,080
Minnesota look alikes and resemblance

506
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,520
and Hollywood stars of Chicago the uh

507
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,440
there are several and then plus the

508
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,240
agents around town book me how do you

509
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,520
like you've done a lot lots and lots of

510
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,440
TV

511
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,720
commercials yeah uh done in with good

512
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,679
taste this is probably one of the

513
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,919
biggest stipulations I make is the fact

514
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,039
that uh if you're going to portray John

515
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,480
Wayne you portray him as John Wayne

516
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,960
would be portrayed so don't ask me to do

517
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,320
a commercial if it isn't in Good Taste M

518
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,880
that's you carry on that Legend in a

519
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,919
positive manner right what uh have you

520
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,400
had any contact with Wayne's family

521
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,520
every now and then I meet a member of

522
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,760
the family an old girlfriend uh director

523
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,159
producer uh

524
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,159
uh the gentleman that was on this

525
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,559
particular uh series that was that we

526
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,320
saw in the clip was also the Director of

527
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,360
Photography on stage coach okay with

528
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,360
John Wayne wow so it gives you a little

529
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,919
tip you know cameraman always liked it

530
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,240
John Wayne would kind of lean back and

531
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,559
step into a scene he said it'd set it up

532
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,159
for us uhuh but it's uh it's really neat

533
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,600
because everywhere you travel you you

534
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,880
either meet somebody that knew John

535
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,120
Wayne or got to meet him or worked with

536
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,760
him or friend or family or whatever wow

537
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,720
