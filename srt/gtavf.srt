00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,100
[Music]

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,360

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,320

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,719
TV yeah really like people are like what

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,560
about arrest of development I'm like I

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,080
try to pretend to be cool I'm like yeah

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,359
that's great but nothing beats an old

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,760
person falling down

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,519
Montage ever it doesn't [ __ ] matter

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,880
have you seen Louis have you seen the

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,320
old person falling down Montage episode

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,640
1 season 19 about 20 minutes

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,000
in just fast forward they [ __ ] they

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,200
have their purchases and they're walking

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,760
through a fountain I don't know why

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,040
they're in a fountain they got bags and

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,040
then

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,399
poof oh just thinking about

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,160
it but whenever I watch it and the date

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,000
is blurred out I'm always confused why

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,640
they have to blur the date out there's

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,160
no reason to blur the date out why was

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,520
that your grandpa just got hit in the

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,320
ball bag by a teeter totter and the date

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,320
is what you found offensive

27
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,280
what was the date like it has to be

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,920
something that everyone would know too

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,320
like it can't be like I called into to

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,520
work that day and they're going to know

31
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,720
that I was the one

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,159
filming cuz no one would know so it's

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,119
got to be a date that we would all see

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,680
and be like these people are jerks so

35
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,520
whenever it's blurred out I assume it

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
was filmed on September 11th

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,439
2001 and that's why they blurred it

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,799
right like they watch doomsday on TV and

39
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,640
their first thought is there's going to

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,640
be no traffic

41
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,640
we were going to the beach anyway might

42
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,479
as well still and then they get there

43
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,560
and [ __ ] grandma falls off a unicycle

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,399
or something they're like this is too

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,799
funny not to send

46
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:46,920
in but we should do something about that

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,240
date we're going to look like [ __ ]

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,920
right you're an older gentleman it

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,920
November 22nd 1963 same

50
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,920
