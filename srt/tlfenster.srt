00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,680
it for btim I see but I see well let's

91
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,680
if you get to my book on to the book yes

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,320
it's a uh it's a very interesting and

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:10,000
compelling book it's uh it's uh getting

94
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,440
people to say to say no because as uh as

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
as we find out in in our in our society

96
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,479
today too many people are are saying yes

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,639
to too many things when they want to say

98
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,680
no that's the difference so so tell us

99
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,280
uh how did you uh what inspired you to

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,440
write the book Dr well first off I

101
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,039
wanted to make money let's be honest

102
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,199
about it yes the uh that's a it's a joke

103
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,960
yeah what it was a joke it was a joke no

104
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
about making money of course I I wanted

105
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,560
I wanted to write the book to help

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,360
people right yes to to stop them from

107
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,400
saying yes that's right when they should

108
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,479
say no right I mean so many of us we

109
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,639
have such a low self-esteem that we're

110
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,800
always trying to please people mean ever

111
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,039
since we were born we're trying to

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,360
please our parents we try to please our

113
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,800
teachers our peers in school uh in

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,160
college we're trying to please our first

115
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,280
girlfriends or boyfriends whatever we

116
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,199
move on to the business World we're

117
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,840
always trying to to please people we we

118
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,080
tend to lose our own self-identity in

119
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,639
this in this myopic uh sense of the

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,479
world so you're basically what you're

121
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,560
saying is that we're just we just should

122
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,639
say no more we should say no when we

123
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,919
really mean no yes take for in usually

124
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,120
we most of the time we do mean no don't

125
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,039
we did you you I I I suppose that you

126
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,120
you you realized that when you wrote the

127
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,160
book that no not sometimes when we say

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,720
no we're actually saying yes to

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,440
ourselves so you're saying that is the

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,800
dichotomy and the Paradox at the same

131
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,639
time I see um so well tell us um how

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,120
long did it take you to write the book

133
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,880
it took me well years of research uh I

134
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,440
started uh researching this in what kind

135
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,800
of car did you drive while you were

136
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,280
writing the

137
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,639
book well I started I was driving a

138
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,039
Volkswagen when I started what kind the

139
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,360
the the uh the beetle beetle that little

140
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,639
uh the further I got along the more I

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,039
learned about self assertiveness I I

142
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,080
bought a a Volvo oh you did by the end

143
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,240
of the book that's a that's a uh Volvo

144
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,680
is a very uh very well-designed and safe

145
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,240
car it's a yes car it's a car that says

146
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,400
yes it's I see because I wanted it

147
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,240
that's my you mhm what um where did you

148
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,560
uh do most of the uh the research for

149
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,560
this one on most of my patients actually

150
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,520
I I am a PS a psych olist you are you so

151
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,280
you're a uh you you went to uh to

152
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,800
college yes I did and you you you became

153
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,360
a doctor of assertiveness training a

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,520
doctor of psychology actually of

155
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,080
psychology of the the psychology of

156
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,039
assertiveness training that came out of

157
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,120
yes yeah well yes exactly came out of

158
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,759
that but I no I did research on all my

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,800
patients I interviewed them and find out

160
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,199
finding out what really makes them tick

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,319
and why they why they say yes when they

162
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,440
want to say no mhm and most of it comes

163
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,400
from a low self-esteem what kind of

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,039
people did you study were there were

165
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,120
were there large amounts of people large

166
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,199
amounts all my patients actually ranging

167
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,479
from you know semi mildly neurotic all

168
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,680
the way to did you study anyone that you

169
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:20,159
were related to I did study my um uh my

170
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,520
mother your mother yes and where does

171
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,960
she live well she's in a nursing home

172
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,680
now oh in really Santa Monica yes you

173
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,840
you put your mother in a nursing

174
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,720
home well she was getting very old and I

175
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,760
couldn't take care of her and father

176
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,000
died you had to buy the Volvo I suppose

177
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,919
the yes car well yes but I I did I she's

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,120
being taken care of very well I see I

179
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,080
mean I could take care of her myself so

180
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,680
do you think that uh by by writing this

181
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,000
book the the the writing of the book

182
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,240
itself do you feel that it is it is a a

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,880
uh the book itself is a a book on how to

184
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,920
say uh no or or how to say yes cuz you

185
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,800
you say that the don't say yes when you

186
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,680
want to say no but do you think the book

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,320
The basic premise of the book is to say

188
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,600
yes or to say no it's to say no actually

189
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,200
to say no that's the operative word

190
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,040
there no because too often we say yes

191
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,680
when we mean we should be yes we all

192
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,200
should we should always be aware that

193
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,959
that uh people will will try to use us

194
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
and people will try to take advantage of

195
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,800
us exactly and and in in order to to to

196
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,839
stop that we we should be saying no too

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,519
many times uh too many times people into

198
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,200
very unpleasant situations by uh uh

199
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,760
being LAX and and saying yes yes is The

200
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,680
Lax way I think no is it's easy to say

201
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,920
yes it's easy and it it doesn't take

202
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,040
anything to say yes but it it takes much

203
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,560
more to say no exactly I'm sure you say

204
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,200
that in the book here to say no you're

205
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,600
inviting conflict you're inviting uh

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
contradiction you're inviting uh a

207
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,920
disagreement and that's that's you

208
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
really sticking your neck out a long way

209
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,399
you're you're taking a risk and that's

210
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,279
what we need to do each one of us is

211
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,680
take more risks and that's what I've

212
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,640
been doing taking more risks I took a

213
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,120
risk writing that book yes I I see her

214
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,399
that um if if we can get a close-up of

215
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:17,120
this um I I see you uh you you worked

216
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,720
with this on on with a female I think

217
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,360
that's taking a pretty big risk right

218
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,079
there don't you think so well no I mean

219
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,880
she's a very distinguish colleague of

220
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,839
mine she's very so she did the the

221
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,760
typing did she like she was probably a

222
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,200
good typist and secretary she was my

223
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,800
equal in all the research she she she

224
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,800
did she made the the coffee and and she

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,160
was it was it was it upsetting to have a

226
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,680
secretary a female secret uh I didn't

227
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,440

uh uh read read some and and get a uh

310
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,199
I'll I'll read a case study for you here

311
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,720
Rick Schulman a recent PhD came to me

312
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,320
with a career problem yes he used to

313
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,079
enjoy teaching his college classes but

314
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,199
recently he found the work burdensome

315
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,920
and depressing our discussion revealed

316
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,079
that the change started while he was

317
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,040
working on his doctoral thesis because

318
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,040
he was so busy he stopped preparing his

319
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,759
lectures and depended on the offthe cuff

320
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,560
remarks after completing the thesis he

321
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,839
continued his newly acquired habit of

322
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,360
giving the unprepared lectures Rick

323
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,360
realized these lectures were

324
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,759
disorganized and superficial it was this

325
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,880
knowledge that brought about his

326
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,600
depression and dissatisfaction the

327
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,600
thought never occurred to him to do

328
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,759
something about it that's a uh very very

329
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,040
very interesting case study you you've

330
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,880
uh taken someone who who became LAX and

331
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,600
and as a result of becoming LAX and

332
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,440
disorganized he became uh depressed and

333
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,360
unhappy with his work which we can see

334
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,800
happening all the time exactly I mean he

335
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,040
should have been happy about his work

336
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,639
otherwise he uh she should have just

337
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,040
quit I mean in order we have to be happy

338
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,160
in order to function properly and we we

339
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,560
live under this illusion that we that

340
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,959
we're happy just by pretending we're

341
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,880
happy I see uh could you uh tell us a

342
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,759
little more about uh about Rick uh Rick

343
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,480
yes well he he quit I finally convinced

344
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,199
him to stop you convinced him to quit

345
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,399
yes and he moved to Montana He why did

346
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,240
you convince him to quit because he was

347
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,160
not happy you are you telling people to

348
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,560
quit to quit their jobs if they're not

349
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,720
happy they should quit they should find

350
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,759
tell them you're you're telling me to

351
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,600
say no to to to uh uh working and and

352
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,639
being not no to working to say yes to I

353
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,759
ask you what what you're doing it's just

354
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,319
a little I I I just felt uncomfortable

355
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,480
the other way this table's awfully big

356
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:24,880
and it was pressing against my

357
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
circulation because you push you pushed

358
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,000
it on me and I was just trying to push

359
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,319
it push it away oh well I was just just

360
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,519
wanted to make enough room for myself

361
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,079
but now we're both

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:29,799
increase the frequency of

407
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,480
interourse their marital difficulties of

408
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,600
course say it their marital difficulties

409
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,600
came to a head when Peggy discovered

410
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,679
that Roy had had several brief affairs

411
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,360
with other women he claimed this was

412
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,440
because he continually felt frustrated

413
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,880
um quote Peggy and I rarely have sexual

S no it is not pornographic

420
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,120
sexual relations are very important

421
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
that's that's a source of so much

422
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,679
tension and so much self-esteem it's a

423
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
source of tension because people are

424
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,880
saying yes to

425
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,159

with who I am well yes I can see that

431
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,240
you're let me ask you a question do you

432
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,159

438
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,799
uh a book about telling people to quit

439
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,559
and about uh pornography I wouldn't it's

440
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,720
not telling people to quit it's not porn

441
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,720
it's not about pornography it's about

442
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,520
helping people to find their own

443
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,360
self-esteem their own self seem to be

444
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,480
you seem to be directing people to to

445
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,280
quit and to to quit things they don't

446
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,799

don't really want to that's that's what

449
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,640

Frank I got along with Frank but he was

460
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,240
he was from the old traditional sense of

461
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,679
himself he was he was he was too uh a

462
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,039
little too uh tight for you maybe he was

463
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,480
well he was uptight yes he was he he

464
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,159
arranged everything neatly in the room I

465
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,559
remember we had many fights over you

466
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,320
know how to if the chair was out of

467
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,360
place and stuff I really didn't care cuz

468
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,080
that was not important it wasn't

469
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,960
important to feelings are the most

470
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,120
important furthering yourself through

471
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,120
college did you even it wasn't important

472
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,120
to be neat and to uh to keep your see

473
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,440
that's part of it we put on this false

474
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,279
sense that if we arrange our lives

475
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,559
externally like nice little neat things

476
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:15,480
and everything's going to be happy

477
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,400
inside when it should just be the

478
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,159
opposite you should arrange your life to

479
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,120
what's happening inside which is free

480
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:24,120
flowing which is

481
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,240
sexual the same one well we I I think

482
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,600
people need to to arrange things more

483
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,039
people aren't that's that's why we have

484
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,279
so many problems because people are

485
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,640
letting themselves go and there people

486
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,440
are people are have the attitude like

487
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,960
you do that that we should uh be loose

488
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,919
people become we should not be loose

489
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,840
ever at and and that's that's what

490
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,919
causes the problem become pressure

491
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,480
cookers we become LAX and we become

492
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,919
loose and and lazy and and we and we we

493
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:55,440
don't realize what's going on and go by

494
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,440
