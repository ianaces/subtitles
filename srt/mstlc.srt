a parent in this day and age you guys

340
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,720

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,759
just everywhere right now and I think

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,720
parents are using it inappropriately on

351
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,199
their kids for instance I saw this

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,559
their children like big brother are the

[Music]

405
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,919
though [ __ ] you get a grip I always

406
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,480
thought my dad was an [ __ ] growing up

407
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,000
who wanted nothing to do with me turns

408
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,600
out he was just busting his ass to put

409
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,240
food on the table you know what I mean

410
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,880

411
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,679
Mike you go and do whatever you want

412
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,919

547
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,520
best way to save money I found but it

548
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,440
sucks cuz I have to watch whatever she's

549
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,360
watching watching and she likes the

550
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,159
worst television on the planet like I

551
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,760
had to watch Oprah the other day I had

552
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,520
to because she was watching Oprah and

553
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
she was making me a sandwich and that's

554
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,840
called

555
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,559
compromise so I'm watching this show

556
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,320
right and I don't want to watch it to

557
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,960
begin with and the story is this

558
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,640
13-year-old girl fell in love and had an

559
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,600
affair with her 45-year-old softball

560
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,520
coach which is disgusting I know but the

561
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,039
cool thing was at the end of the episode

562
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,310
Oprah gave everybody a 45-year-old

563
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,440
softball

564
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,360
[Applause]

565
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,679
coach I like Oprah though because she

566
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,120
always has stories of hope you know we

567
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,320

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,880
the love dojo for a spank and tickle

610
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,640
contest but sometimes I'll say

611
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,520
ridiculous [ __ ] to people just to test

612
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,120
their sense of humor right I look at

613
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,000
this girl and I rattle off the worst

614
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,799
pickup line anyone's ever said I go you

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,240

616
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,240
leather

617
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,120
sheets but she looked at me dead serious

618
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,039
and she was like is that even

619
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,919
comfortable and as soon as she said

620
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:48,720
comfortable my brain immediately went

621
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,519
into safety mode where it was like Mike

622
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,080
listen if by some stroke of bad luck you

623
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:58,880
get this girl pregnant you were going to

624
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,840

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,519
there that's not true I actually ate her

632
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,480
out on the hood of a snowmobile later

633
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,080
that

634
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,320
night why because I'm a gentleman that's

635
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,159
why you notice she wasn't blowing me in

636
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,440
the joke I was going down on her cuz

637
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,440
someone still cares

638
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
ladies

639
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,240

contains salty

644
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,240
language but it's peppered with

645
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,080
morals this is more of a public service

646
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,760
announcement all right here's the deal I

647
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
hang out with a lot of single guys who

648
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,519
Lie To Girls At Last Call cuz they're

649
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,320
trying to pull a piece of skirt steak

650
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,320
their words not

651
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
mine

652
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,320
and they lie to girls but they don't lie

653
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,880
about what kind of car they drive or how

654
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,559
much money they make I have single guy

655
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,640
friends that lie about the size of their

656
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,080
penis I don't know why as a guy you

657
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,760
would ever think that that's a good idea

658
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,519
to lie about the size of your penis cuz

659
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,720
let's say you talking up all night she

660
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,200
believes you you go back to her place

661
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,919
things heat up she pulls down your pants

662
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,600
then what Casanova you've got a lot of

663
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,399
explaining to

664
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,840
do and I don't have a big penis I don't

665
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,120
I don't give a [ __ ] I don't you people

666
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,880
I'll tell

667
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,360
you I wouldn't even want a big penis I

668
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,519
wouldn't I've seen porno we've all seen

669
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,080
the guys in porno holy

670
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:45,080
[ __ ] those guys are slamming [ __ ]

671
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,080
with [ __ ] the size of duralogs

672
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,600
which makes for a great show but then

673
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,279
you figure they have to walk around with

674
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,760
that giant dick in their everyday life I

675
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:55,480
have a hard enough time trying to find a

676
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,519
pair of jeans that fit I don't want the

677
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,200
added aggravation of bringing a tail

678
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,360
into the mix like yes sir do you think

679
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,320
you could let out the crotch of these

680
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Wranglers just a tad I seem to have been

681
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,399
blessed with an enormous

682
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,159
tallywhacker somewhat of a hindrance

683
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,240
when I buy slacks you've got to roll it

684
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,200
up like a cinnamon bun and stick it with

685
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,799
bobby pins just to keep it from flopping

686
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,559
out of the bottom of your shorts at the

687
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:21,960
family volleyball

688
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,320
game cuz that's an awkward topic of

689
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,240
discussion no matter how great your

690
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,039

[ __ ] and it's everything that you want

703
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,600
but then four months down the road like

704
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,799
most Rel relationships right you guys
