friends like I guess I friends I did

33
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,610
that twice as figured out it was a scam

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,520
but I was like I got a gig at age 16 I'm

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,259
a comic no and then I was doing other

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,570
things like radio and putting on punk

37
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,860
rock shows for a long time so 2008 I

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,600
started this thing called the

39
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,509
altercation Punk comedy tour and it's

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,140
all been a a steady work in progress

41
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,140
since then

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,869
the new album is called misanthrope it's

43
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,280
a my latest our this one is all me it

44
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,960
was filmed in dallas at a place called

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,810
three links which is one of my favorite

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,020
rock venues in the country and with

47
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,630
filmed last summer came out in august of

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,030
2016 and it's basically an hour of me

49
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,860
kind of ranting and raving about the

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,489
kids today and just kind of my old man

51
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,319
persona I'm slowly going from a useful

52
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,180
punk rocker filled with angst to kind of

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,099
a forty-year-old get off my lawn guy

54
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,700
filled with angst so it's a little bit

55
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:30,160
more worldly I think no it's the audio

56
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,690
CD in full and also it's a film special

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,730

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,760

featuring material and behind-the-scenes

77
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,130
mania from all those people that I just

78
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:24,489
said you can't afford not to five it

79
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:26,290
it's practically giving yourself away so

80
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,180
every comedian of the podcast and people

81
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,730
have been asked me forever to start once

82
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,140
the last summer I finally did but I

83
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,540
essentially drag fee because I didn't

84
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,910
want it just to be comedians talking to

85
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,700
comedians about comedy because the world

86
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,500
does not need that so I I started

87
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,769
something called the road podcast calm

88
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,090
and I was amazed that the road podcast

89
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,130
hadn't been taking it I don't know how I

90
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,569
hit the jackpot on that so its a mix of

91
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,160
comedians there's a lot of comedians on

92
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,900
it but there's also a lot of musicians

93
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,579
folks that I you know know and love

94
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,859
people like Mike Watt we had Dinosaur Jr

95
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,859
on I'm not that long ago Rollins has

96
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:01,900
been a guest on it Swan you know just

97
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,720
really all underground cool

98
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,670
stuff and also things that have no

99
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,930
comedy related whatsoever that just wild

100
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,470
stuff you see on the road I went to the

101
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,760
thing in Texas called the snake farm

102
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,459
which is exactly what it sounds like

103
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,500
just a roadside zoo where they have like

104
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,509
a 12-foot king cobra and I just talked

105
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,949
