183
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,120
and then I should write about them uhhuh

184
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,479
I don't know it's really it's really

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,479
clicked where do you get your

186
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,120
information from crazy men who call me

187
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,599
and tell me that the best looking men in

188
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,319
come and that I you know I need to do

189
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,000
this or I need to do that and so and

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,680
after I get these phone calls from these

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,120
uh people who've been abusing drugs

192
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,879
then then I try to find people who have

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,319
not been abusing drugs to confirm the

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,039
information that I heard how do you

195
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,560
confirm now when you write a source you

196
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,960
get like two sources before you put a

197
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,039
story in depends on what the what the

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,440
item is but I try to get as close to the

199
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,000
actual Source uh of the information as I

200
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,520
can okay what happens when you get

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,960
something that's not right that you put

202
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,080
something misinformation in that does

203
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,960
haveen oh yeah I try to correct it but

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,440
that's the nature of gaset too and Liz

205
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,400
Smith I understand runs a correction

206
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,960
almost every column uhuh and I don't

207
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,120
have uh my uh stats aren't quite that

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,280
bad really okay okay how does that make

209
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,199
you feel that and in fact I ask you that

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,599
you become a celebrity by writing this

211
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
column well it's almost as absurd as you

212
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,879
being a

213
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,120
celebrity but not quite I don't know I

214
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,960
don't know why you so hard on me I

215
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,960
someone has to

216
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,240
be what what's the biggest Joy about

217
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,520
about writing a column for you oh I

218
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,759
don't know I think it's a lot of fun and

219
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,319
it's something that I'm interested in

220
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,599
and I don't often get to meet people

221
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,280
who've been growing a mustache as long

222
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280

223
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,080
oh man oh man that's the real the

224
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,800
opportunity the rare opportunity to come

225
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,240
and humiliate myself on shows like this

226
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,959

contracted AIDS let's talk about the

544
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,039
AIDS now sure I think I was probably

545
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,600
exposed to the virus in about 1982 which

546
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,480
is kind of ironic because I had run for

547
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,240
office and lost and was personally

548
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,000
bummed out and frankly using too many

549
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,200
chemicals and just being in a down

550
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,200
period And I think it was at that point

551
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,400
that I really exposed myself and assumed

552
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,400
that the virus wasn't here in

553
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,039
Minneapolis an assumption that a lot of

554
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,840
other people still make you know it's in

555
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,400
San Francisco and New York but it's not

556
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,360
here and then um I had skin

557
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,960
manifestations things along the way that

558
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,600
kind of suggested to me that maybe

559
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,720
something was wrong plus I was learning

560
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,720
more as was the world about uh AIDS and

561
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,720
I finally went in for testing in the

562
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,960
very end of ' 885 and found out in the

563
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,520
first week of the new year of ' 86 that

564
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,200
I was HIV positive how did you react to

565
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,679
the them telling you you have AIDS

566
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,720
actually um the counselor at The Red

567
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,919
Door Clinic that I went to was uh kind

568
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,720
of surprised because I wasn't very

569
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,520
shocked um you know I kind of took it

570
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,080
with stoic uh Norwegian

571
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,720
attitude uh you know at the beginning

572
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,000
and I guess that I had really thought it

573
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,120
through and been prepared and thought

574
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
there was a 50-50 chance based on what

575
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,520
I've been doing years ago I've been

576
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,919
practicing safe sex ironically really

577
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,039
since 1983 but um it was too late in a

578
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,080
fact okay okay and right now that you

579
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,159
have the disease I want to talk some

580
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,880
more about this what are you doing to

581
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,480
keep yourself healthy and keep yourself

582
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,000
up and sure that's the most important

583
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,679
thing because the disease is really

584
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,279
treacherous and it does waste your body

585
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:28,200
