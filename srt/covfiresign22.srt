in all in all various walks of life and

49
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,440
of success and things that that tell me

50
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,040
about it and it makes me very happy yeah

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,840
I got to ask you this when you were in

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,360
the process of writing electrician what

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,760
exactly what you're talking about is

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,519
what's hitting me is that this is

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,080
American radio theater mixed with a

56
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,159
heavy new American Theater and European

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,640
avangard theater and when you were

58
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,200
putting this thing together is that

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,080
something when you were trying to go

60
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,879
from point A to point Z in electrition

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,159
the long piece yeah that was something

62
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,319
you were specifically keeping in mind or

63
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,040
you just trying to make yourselves happy

64
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,480
and that's something you all had in

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,440
common no Taylor you're absolutely right

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,560
it it was something we had in common and

67
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,920
I think it it could be best expressed by

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,920
our admiration and love of the Goon

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,000
shows yeah uh the Goon shows for those

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,560
who might not know it uh were a

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,040
surrealistic r was a surrealistic comedy

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,080
radio program that went on actually for

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
quite a long time through the war

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,280
English yeah British on you're doing a

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,879
couple voices on this album am I not

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,599
mistaken there's a

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,959
solid by the goons and the goons

78
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,720
included Spike meligan and uh Peter sers

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,000
and Harry seeum yeah there there you go

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
the Goon shows he's holding up some

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,159
books of the scripts the Goon shows

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,000
right and if you don't know the go shows

83
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,519
Google them and listen to them they're

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,879
they're amazing and there's never been

85
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,120
anything like them frankly fire sign

86
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,200
theater was inspired by their surrealism

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,919
their extraordinary inventive use of

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,560
sound effects their the the the the the

89
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,160
far out musical uh uh um musical

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,479
expression of the

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,919
characters with with voices that were

92
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,400
exaggerated and yet uh char

93
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,520
characteristically identifiable in

94
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,880
amazing ways very cartoony I guess one

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,759
could say but surrealistically cartoony

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,960
like Mad Magazine at its best you know

97
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:50,600
and panic magazine so that surrealism

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,960
was something that zany silly surrealism

99
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,800
was something that attracted us all plus

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,720
the fact that they tell a story yeah in

101
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,759
a half an hour uh Peter got to work with

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Spike Milligan in in London in uh

103
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,960
working on something called not so much

104
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,080
a show moreal way of life if I'm not

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,360
mistaken and uh uh and I unfortunately

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,479

this and uh uh and and we were able to

208
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:24,200
be as totally free as crazy and zany and

209
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,760
surrealistic as we wanted to be because

210
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,160
who knew I mean who cares uh we weren't

211
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,920
thinking commercially right we were just

212
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,200
doing what we had already been playing

213
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,399
with and and were having fun with and

214
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,760
had and all of us kind of had this

215
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,920
agreement that this is what we should be

216
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:48,120
doing you know uh none of us thought

217
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,160
we'd be where we were and or given an

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,279
opportunity like this or be paid to do

219
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,959
something like this amazing and to be

220
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:00,200
given that much Freedom yeah oh my God

221
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:01,399
it was so exhilarating uh so I gladly

222
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,800
kind of

223
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:09,480
surrendered a a a normal career to this

224
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,399
adventure yeah and yet once we sent this

225
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,320
record out of course nobody really knew

226
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,440
who we

227
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,720
were and so it had its effect but it

228
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,600
wasn't

229
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,320
until uh the uh uh what can I call this

230
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,040
the the emergence of FM

231
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,920
radio which was the the lucky thing that

232
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,920
happened happened at the same time we

233
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,680
were doing this making stereo records

234
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,240
suddenly could be played on the radio in

235
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:46,920
Stereo wasn't just you

236
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,839
know and not only that college stations

237
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,399
could play because they weren't

238
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,720
commercial they could play a whole side

239
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
of a record yeah yeah yeah and that was

240
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,639
revolutionary suddenly people started

241
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,959

370
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,559
royalty but they won't have to pay any

371
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,240
studio time all right so that they

372
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,919
spoken art so they can go in and they

373
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,600
could you know work on a on a different

374
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,720
Rhythm and by God that's what they gave

375
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,799
us wow you got a [ __ ] around contract

376
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,960
that's fantastic and that's that's where

377
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:08,080
we beautiful and in in our this was it

378
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,600
the second album uh let's see no how

379
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,799
could you be into place who once was in

380
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,159
danger and all that we did we talk about

381
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,440
that last time we'll talk about that

382
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,400
another just just bits but uh that's

383
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,720
another I mean that's another all

384
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,360
incredible yeah story but yeah ask me

385
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,360
anything else and I'll see if I can my

386
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,000
my two big questions were a I'm not

387
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,200
mistaken those are goon voices and B the

388
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,080
backwards Mast but you exped some of it

389
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,799
I'm still a little confused as to the

390
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,400
backwards masking cuz it was it it's it

391
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,880
only sounds like it they're just

392
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,320
weirding I don't know what literally

393
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,200
what they're doing maybe it could simply

394
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,760
be something as physical as picking up

395
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,840
the tape away from the heads at that

396
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,320
point we did do we did do a lot of that

397
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,039
stuff because we you know we they didn't

398
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,159
have the sophisticated

399
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,039
computerized sound systems that we later

400
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,360
were later developed so we would do

401
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,799
things like when we did on Boo's I think

402
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,000
it was Boos we did Thunder electronic

403
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,280
Thunder I'd have to go up to the echo

404
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,400
chamber room and bang physically on

405
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,240
whatever those things were you know that

406
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,240
that created

407
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,000
that with my fists you know and and uh

408
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,760
and of course part of the fun and the

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,200
challenge of all of that was uh being

410
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,960
asked to invent uh ways sound effects to

411
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,440
invent sound effects

412
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,480
and both both that I got a lot of that

413
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,919
stuff also from going to um Hollywood

414
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,360
toy store really yeah because they had

415
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:47,120
they had a gun for instance which was a

416
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,919
I wish I still had it a replica of a

417
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,039
M13 or with a a tape Loop of a of a of a

418
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,679
gun on

419
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:59,280
it I use that many times but I would

420
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,840
always seek out whatever elect

421
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,799
or electric sound effects toys and

422
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:10,000
things were out there I think we hear a

423
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:12,679
lot of these in in uh Mar in January of

424
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,280
68 when you do a life in the day as a

425
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,120
magic mushroom show you're doing fake

426
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,039
commercials for cartel toys that's right

427
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,159
that which led to a a dwarf and remember

428
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,159
I found an electronic bird you

429
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,679
know I have one of those you have one of

430
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,080
those yeah I do it was a Christmas

431
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,679
decoration but it does that exact same

432
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,880
thing you're talking about what happened

433
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,159
to the the stuff that you rescued from

434
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,960
being junked uh we we kept it and used

435
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:45,240
it for a long time until you know I

436
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,880
guess we but as they say uh the Nick

437
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,120
danger stuff I bet you came in real

438
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,000
Handy oh yes oh yes and and and later in

439
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,480
our stage shows we built special stuff

440
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,640
to you know approximate it to make fun

441
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,640
of to allow the audience to have fun

442
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,520
with seeing sound effects uh and and

443
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,679
Stan freeberg as I said because of our

444
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:11,240
association with Fred Jones who was one

445
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:14,799
of our greatest engineering production

446
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,200
collaborators uh he also worked on

447
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,320
Stan's albums they engineered Stan

448
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,919
albums and and it ended up in Stan's

449
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,559
office and in Stan's repertoire that's

450
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:32,880
amazing my God yeah so who in cuz this

451
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:36,240
is out of like all of and I love all of

452
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,600
your guys albums but this one is is I I

453
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,159
there's something about this one I just

454
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,360
think is just perfect and it's one of

455
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,440
the ones I heard early it wasn't the

456
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,720
first one but it was one of the ones I

457
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,240
heard early and it it's really amazing

458
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,960
because even though the first side is

459
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:56,440
three different tracks it's all one

460
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,559
bit Loops into the next right after the

461
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,400
atom bomb comes it goes right into

462
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,080
smoking The Joint right I mean it's

463
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,600
there it's seamless so I mean like even

464
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,159
though it is three tracks it's still

465
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,720
it's a side a and it's a side B it's

466
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,480
this side right you're right you're

467
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,520
right they that was something

468
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,880
which I guess we all agreed on early

469
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,480
that that even the albums the first four

470
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,880
albums are all connected one to the

471
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,400
other to the other to the other uh a

472
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:30,760
quad rology and and and and I think that

473
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,679
was part of the extenuation of that idea

474
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,480
which again nobody had ever really done

475
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,320
before no I mean they were musicians

476
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,360
were just doing concept albs you know

477
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,760
and to think like a non-m musician could

478
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,720
make or especially you know a comedian

479
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,600
could make something that's non you we

480
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,880
actually were hired to work on the birds

481
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,360
one of the birds conceptual pieces which

482
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,080
was what do you remember what it was but

483
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,559
draft morning I think so and then later

484
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,720
Chad and Jeremy's uh uh cabbages and

485
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:05,039
Kings uh and

486
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,880
and because I had a girlfriend named

487
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,520
Kathy

488
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,159
cozy uh who's now been married to John

489
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,240
Sebastian for decades related to Patty

490
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,080
mou by any chance not related to Patty M

491
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,360
make sure uh uh she had been John

492
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,600
Sebastian who wrote the uh theme to

493
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,120
Welcome Back Cotter that's right if I'm

494
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,000

496
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,440
actually it was after Kathy cozy that I

497

did it's in the

501
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,799
Memoirs I'm sure so I'm excited for that

502
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,559
so

503
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,760
Kathy had been in England and she knew

504
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,960
it's how I got to meet MC Jagger through

505
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,080

509
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,039

so let her in so Jeremy uh oh anyway

523
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:52,080

524
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:55,039
with a tiki bar a flaming fountain that

525
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,080
ran down all the way down to the bottom

526
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:04,159
of the staircase big an ape cage

527
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:07,159

shelter it's where we kept our pot mhm

529
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:15,640
sure and

530
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:18,919
uh that place became you know a a a

531
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,159
harbor for hot and cold running girls m

532
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,240

friends I see him when I'm in London as

535
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,919
often I can and Chad and Jeremy have had

536
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,159
a great resuscitated career uh and been

537
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,559
touring all over the place you know with

538
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,840
their big

539
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,960
hits uh so there was another benefit of

540
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,600
of all of that you know these

541
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:49,360
friendships and people and everything oh

545
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,880
the girls who was living with us uh and

546
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:04,279
really cute little blonde from

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,679
Atlanta and uh many years later well I

548
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,440
don't know if I should get it of all

549
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,480
this we can get into it next time yeah

550
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,840
if you want we can save some things I do

551
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,320
have one question about bside I have one

552
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,760
question go back to this who Who's

553
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,240
Playing Lord

554
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,080
kitner and did all of that coughing

555
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,399
happen in one

556
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,440
tap and did he do it in one tap that is

557
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,960
insane

558
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,640
and like this is how sad and like kind

559
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,279
of like a sad freaky fan I am I've tried

560
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,600
doing it to see if I can because you

561
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,000
know like it's just to see if I without

562
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,279
trying to ruin it just to see if I can

563
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,880
make over he's I mean like when he gets

564
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,200
to the end he is heaving Berman it's so

565
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,919
impressive sounded like somebody

566
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,240
actually fell too I how much physical

567
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,559
acting was going on far as me just

568
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,279
that's one of my favorite that's what's

569
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,760
great oh he broke the glass yes yes yes

570
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,919
now which I think that that was all part

571
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,080
of the first live the first live take

572
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,399
well you know when when we started we

573
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:13,520
wanted to do as much of the production

574
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:16,840
live as we possibly could okay because

575
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,320
first of all that was what we knew

576
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,320
remember we've been improvising on the

577
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,039
radio live all four of us sure and and

578
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,480
and we all came out of some kind of

579
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,919
theater background remember I met Peter

580
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,440
at Yale when he was writing the lyrics

581
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,559
for two musicals I starred in written by

582
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,200
Austin Pendleton oh yeah Tom Jones and

583
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,799
Booth is back in town M and uh so we all

584
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,760
came out of a theater tradition even

585
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,360
David you know not as much as Phil whose

586
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,880
mother taught acting at Fresno State

587
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,480
University that's amazing so Peter and

588
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,640
Phil and I had a a a theatrical

589
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,679
background David had somewhat of a

590
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,760
theatrical background but when we worked

591
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:01,440
together we wanted to to use that energy

592
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,440
uh uh when we were recording yeah and

593
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,600
then we would add overdubs and sound

594
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,919
effects and things later because we we

595
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:14,080
had solid tracks solid lead tracks and

596
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:17,039
and uh uh and and our and our energy and

597
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,279
our chemistry was you know on the on the

598
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,080
record yeah my God you know again that

599
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,159
cat is it's perfect we're talking about

600
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:30,600
sound effects and we have a cat the

601
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,880
best hi Kitty look at this big old guy

602
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,159
that's a big cat I have a cat as big as

603
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,559
that honey G I think that cat's even

604
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,840
bigger than mine this episode oh he's a

605
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,799
beauty weird I love it what's his name

606
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,039
or her um it's it's a neighborhood cat

607
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:52,159
so we've gone so far to call it gray cat

608
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:54,559
gray cat hi gray be hi gray I want to go

609
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,000
out now thank you I wanted to come in

610
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,640
now I want to go out thank you oh

611
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,360
they're so funny uh yeah so that's

612
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,120
that's another aspect of of of what this

613
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,760
was all about yeah and again once you

614
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,519
lay down really strong lead

615
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,240
tracks you could you know add the music

616
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,480
and add the sound effects and add the

617
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,000
background Walla and add all of that

618
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,240
stuff uh with with ease you weren't

619
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,320
under pressure makes sense to do it and

620
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,360
and that's where once we realize how

621
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,480
easy that was to do and and that it was

622
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,840
possible to actually put it on a for

623
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,600
track tape right you know it's

624
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,760
stereo we we did it yeah yeah and and

625
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,720
the learning curve was very fast yeah

626
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,440
for everybody when's the first time you

627
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,399
met somebody who' bought it oh yeah

628
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,240
great well it's a great question I don't

629
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:49,720
think I have a great answer I I I'm not

630
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:53,200
sure I could remember that uh I I don't

631
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:58,080
even all I guess I can I can say that

632
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,799
the uh Fame that came to us and the

633
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,080
celebrity that came to us was very

634
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,640
personal

635
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,080
mhm people would come up to us as

636
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,320
individuals or in a group and say you

637
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,200
know you guys saved my life or wow when

638
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,240
is the Revolution going to

639
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,799
happen a lot of that you know but but it

640
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,440
was all very personal it wasn't like

641
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,440
adoring crowds who want us to sign

642
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,600
records at a record store that came

643
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,159
later sure sure uh so it was subtle I

644
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,840
guess that's the only way I can put it

645
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,039
it was subtle and uh and my life it's

646
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,640
literally like meeting wizard raas what

647
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,360
are you saying yeah being a fanboy I've

648
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,000
been a fan I'm a fanboy from way back

649
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,240
and I'm I have the I can say I've

650
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
embarrassed the [ __ ] out of myself in

651
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,880
front of Douglas Adams and lots of

652
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,279
people and what you what happens is

653
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,039
you're not quite sure how this person in

654
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,760
front of you did this magic thing yeah

655
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,679
it's true you how do you get into

656
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,559
beginning to ask the question of what

657
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,120
what the the line I love that one line

658
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,399
yeah where did that come you you

659
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,519
don't and when it's when when you're

660
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,919
part of an opus like we are uh you know

661
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,039
it's like well I played the second

662
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,360
violin on that piece you know and and it

663
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:14,360
was all written down for me and I played

664
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,080
it you had a good day yeah I had a good

665
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,360
day and we added some Echo to it and

666
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,080
it's great you

667
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,279
know but but uh you you you did make me

668
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,880
think of something else about all that

669
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,840
which of course I immediately forgot

670
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,519
uh right but but it has something to do

671
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,600
with

672
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:39,000
uh uh the yes I I know what was I doing

673
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,880
because you're asking me if people you

674
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,360
know how people uh I'm I'm going to try

675
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,399
to put together some more pieces here I

676
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,159
said I was living with Jeremy Clyde but

677
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,240
before and was it after that that I

678
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,120
lived yeah I guess it was after that

679
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,519
because you see I I was still pursuing a

680
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,960
career as an

681
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,960
actor now when I did the Daniel Boone

682
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,799
show what year was that do you remember

683
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,440
that Jesus Christ you don't remember

684
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,320
that I I played a French character in

685
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,240
The Daniel Boon in in the Daniel Boon

called No Bless obl yeah with Fest

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,240
Parker and and Rosie GRE and all those

689
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,159
guys great are we talking late 50s or

690
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,120
late 60s no no not late 50s it was in

691
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,679
the 60s somewhere you can still get it

692
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,840
online I mean no bless o b i play a a a

693
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,080
French pastry chef who is pretending to

694
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,240
be the king King of

695
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,639
France see so that so that he can you

696
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,559
know do what he needs to do in America

697
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,799
and uh uh but I'm not exactly sure when

698
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,159
that was it was during fire sign theater

699
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:45,840
career it certainly was before uh I did

700
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,399
the Henry jaglin movie a safe place see

701
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,399
one of the reasons why I have so much

702
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:53,080
trouble remembering all of this stuff is

703
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,600
that I have all these concurrent careers

704
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,559
going on yeah I mean it's quite

705
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,360
extraordinary uh in one way it it it's

706
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,840
wonderful and and was very satisfying

707
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,399
and allowed me to to be in two places at

708
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,600
once when I wasn't anywhere at all and

709
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:11,200
to use my various talents but on the

710
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,760
other hand I was never identified with

711
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,679
one thing and that's what creates

712
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,960
celebrity sure see if I if I'd had a

713
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,960
television series or if I'd even done an

714
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,960
appearance on Star Trek or something you

715
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,639
say

716
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,919
oh you know I could go to ComiCon but as

717
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:30,519
it is you know I'm Howard on the rug

718
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,320
rats you know so you know okay which is

719
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,360
still pretty damn good damn good 14

720
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,880
years but still if I go to ComiCon

721
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,320
nobody cares you know it's not like oh

722
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,320
you were on Star Trek you know I I find

723
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,120
that kind of woefully ironic that

724
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,440
there's something called Comic Con and

725
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,600
you can go largely unrecognized yeah

726
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,760
where in the hell is the Comic Con for

727
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,840
Comics right but like you know somebody

Gumby whatever Batman versus Gumby that

730
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,840
they're working on that you don't know

731
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,839
who will win no really it's be good all

732
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,560
that clay inside the

733
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,359
mechanism when are they going to when

734
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,240
are they going to do something with

735
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:14,240
plastic

736
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,200
man um he pops up every once in a while

737
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,960
does he Plastic Man very rarely I love

738
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,240
plastic in cartoons but not not even now

739
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,720
Plastic Man uh Frank Miller uh did a

740
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,200
sequel to The Dark Knight uh the the

741
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,280
graphic novel he did a second one um and

742
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,000
uh man is actually in it the rubber

743
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,560
Knight or

744
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,280
something that's a that's a stretch well

745
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,960
that's an adult device that you you

746
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,520
don't has variable speed so good at

747
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,320
getting derailed what I want to do is no

748
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,560
it's fine it's fine I I want to say

749
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,240
though like I listening to it today

750
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,560
because I obviously heard it before but

751
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,839
I decided to take uh Jeremy's advice

752
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,639
from when he like really got into fir

753
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,679
sign was listening to it with some nice

754
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,639
quality head taking your [ __ ] time

755
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,280
because I have a lot of problem with

756
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,560
that when I'm listening to Comedy alum

757
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,960
I interviewed guest DW overy

758
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:08,400
blind favor because it's genuine theater

759
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,000
of the mind you know um and so he said

760
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,839
same thing you know just sit there and I

761
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,119
took my sweet time with it and it's just

762
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,200
so much of a different experience and I

763
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,320
think you know if we're going to

764
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,320

773
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,880
years I was imprisoned by faceless

774
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,560
people for a crime of which I had no

Sanders show and then later on on the

820
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,200
Gary Shanley show and a very unique

821
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,359
comic

822
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,599
who uh actually was offered like to

823
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:07,680
replace Johnny Carson at one point in

824
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:11,359
his career really y wow and instead went

825
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,400
into cable he was a Trailblazer he and

826
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,240
he and he created a parody of Carson you

827
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,240
know and it was brilliant brilliant

828
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:22,040
wonderful funny as hell and and and so

829
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,359
he he has had a cultural effect as well

830
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,839
because he was a Trailblazer into the

831
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,599
whole idea of doing comedy on cable

832
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,920
creating a series on cable creating a

833
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:34,640
you know character that was both real

834
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,240
and not real at the same time crossing

835
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,319
the lines Fernwood tonight yeah you know

836
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,760
all of that kind of stuff and it's

837
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:43,960
surrealistic in its own way it's all

838
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,400
it's all subtle and surrealistic so uh

839
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,720
he he made his Mark in a unique way and

840
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,079
of course I haven't really investigated

841
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,680
this as much as I'd like to maybe I will

842
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,560
later but he apparently survived a

843
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,200
terrible automobile accident which and

844
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,079
and died and came came back from the

845
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,839
dead and that's when he took a more

846
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,240
unique path because he realized that

847
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,280
this is life is a gift and what am I

848
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,680
going to do with it yeah see

849
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,599
so here's to you Gary yeah

850
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,880

are a couple there are a couple of

854
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:28,200
moments when fire sign almost had a TV

855
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,240
show or almost had a feature

856
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,640
oh yeah but that was tough it was just

857
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,760
luck it was luck and it was it was life

858
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,599
and death also

859
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,680
because we we had an opportunity to to

860
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,160
do a film which was going to be called

861
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,720
eat uh it would it it would start with

862
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:50,200
uh the fire sign theater in neon and one

863
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,240
by one the letters were all short out

864
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,079
until just the E8 of theater was left

865
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,359
and then the camera would pan in down to

866
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,200
a diner and it was going to it would

867
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:02,960
start in the diner that had a flashing

868
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,640
light that said eat on it and our

869
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,119
producer was going to be a guy named

870
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:12,800
wacko his nickname was wacko Jerry Jerry

871
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,000
Brian Brian and uh Jerry's girlfriend

872
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,240
was

873
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,440
una and they went to before before we

874
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,359
were going to start the production of

875
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,960
the film and everything they went to

876
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:27,720
Hawaii for a vacation and he drowned

877
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,800
there Jesus and that was like by the end

878
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,359
of my father's career you know that was

879
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,400
the fire sign there wasn't that person

880
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,280
there to say I'll take come on let's do

881
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,000
it pick it up you know and later on we

882
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,440
had another opportunity to do that

883
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,359
writing a screenplay of

884
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,960
Ulisses uh a contemporary screenplay of

885
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:54,480
Ulisses for U Phillips what was her name

886
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,160
was it Michelle Phillips was no anyway

887
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:02,079
for some heavy weights in Hollywood

888
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,760
and uh and that also because of two

889
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:09,359
producers who were a little

890
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,640
crazy uh didn't go all the

891
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,280
way and you know when these things don't

892
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,560
happen and if we don't didn't have the

893
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,400
ambition to do it which we

894
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,119
didn't uh then your career goes in

895
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,400
different ways there were other

896
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,520
opportunities that I was aware of that

897
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,280
the other guys didn't understand that

898
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,480
would have helped him

899
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,520
move us forward what we were asked to do

900
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,520
Parts in Death Race 9000 or whatever

901
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,520
that

902
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,040
2,000 yes and I said we should do this

903
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,839
and it was all like oh there's no money

904
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,960
and we G no money and money and the

905
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,760
money and the money you guys would have

906
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,079
been so good in that of course of course

907
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,720
and the other thing was uh don Shay who

908
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,119
later started new line Cinema he was a

909
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,359
Pioneer on early cable television uh I

910
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:59,240
don't I don't know if it was night

911
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,000
flight that was something else but any

912
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,119
EV any event he was early Pioneer and he

913
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
wanted to do a Nick danger movie

914
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:08,839
starring Chevy Chase that's right well

915
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,560
there's no money in it yeah you didn't

916
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:14,920
have any money yeah and and believe it

917
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,680
or not we were hippie we're poor hippies

918
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,000
everybody we needed to make a living at

919
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,880
what we were doing there's four of us

920
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
yeah see it's not like you know okay

921
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,559
I'll get give me $10,000 and I'll do it

922
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,800
and you know and then I can I can get by

923
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,599
for a couple of months no it's four guys

924
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
you know 2500 a piece well it'll get me

925
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,280
through you

926
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,000
know and I can't do anything else I just

927
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,160
have to you know uh all of that the

928
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,119
economic part of it is something which I

929
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:47,319
think if we'd had strong management

930
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,760
would have would have been uh overridden

931
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:53,559
sure because a management company if

932
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,839
it's worth its salt it is funded it has

933
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,720
money y just you know and just like a

934
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,079
big agency they can put money into their

935
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,480
artists to help them because they're

936
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,319
going to get it back sure and

937
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,400
tenfold and we never never got into that

938
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:09,480
kind of a Groove with anything so you

939
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,559
know there were there there are

940
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,480
certainly distinct reasons why fire sign

941
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:19,400
didn't get farther than it could have

942
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:23,040
after a great beginning but culturally

943
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:26,280
we've had a strong success and and a

944
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,520
good effect yeah so that's kind of the

945
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,920
reward we we uh we have to to look to

946
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,079
and I must say I mean my own career was

947
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:39,520
certainly not hampered by Fireside sure

948
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:43,480
because the reputation that uh that I I

949
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,760
was able to carry With Me based on my

950
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:51,440
involvement with this kind of incredible

951
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:53,200
U creation has you know allowed me to uh

952
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,280
to get jobs where somebody would say oh

953
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,839
good I want to work with Phil you know I

954
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,359
know he can do this I would honor to

955
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:01,240
work with you and that's you know very

956
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:03,599
rewarding sure I mean for what it's

957
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,000
worth uh even if fire sign as you know

958
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,160
as a as a big stepping stone didn't blow

959
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,319
up in that same way artistically to

960
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,640
continue to be as good as you were and

961
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,640
then to obviously to get better and

962
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,760
better and better better your art did

963
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:21,800
not suffer for that no we we were we

964
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:25,920
were given uh the the evolving tools

965
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,880
technologically to to uh grow ourselves

966
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,000
yeah and to learn

967
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:33,240
and uh and we worked with some brilliant

968
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,359
people I I mentioned Fred Jones again uh

969
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,520
we worked with some absolutely brilliant

970
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:42,520
Engineers uh who helped us create our

971
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,319
vision yeah through new technology and

972
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,040
it was it was great well I think this is

973
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:49,000
a good place to end it because we are

974
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,640
going to we're doing the next album

975
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,440
whenever we can all get together so many

976
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,839
questions still ask you but we you must

977
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,319
throw them into the next next the bucket

978
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:58,520
for the next album the next one is what

979
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,200
how can you be into places at once is

980
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,960
that okay yes yes what did we talk about

981
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,119
the last time dwarf nothing you didn't

982
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,480
we

983
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:12,559
got got hiding under tables in

984
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,559
restaurants we got it was

985
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,839
fantastic and I mean like and I'm sure

986
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,480
as soon as we cut this there's going to

987
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,760
be eight million questions I have to ask

988
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,280
but I mean this really this is my

989
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,720
favorite uh this is my favorite I mean I

990
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,760
love all of them but this one I just

991
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:29,520
think it's it's so perfect like I've

992
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,880
even tried like I tell my students to

993
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,160
listen to at least the first side of

994
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,480
this just because you know what what are

995
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:41,800
you teaching abnormal psychology yes I I

996
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:44,760
teach uh I teach self flatulation and uh

997
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,680
shepherding how to stay insane insane

998
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,280
right which is a good class for it

999
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,119
really is but I mean like you know I

1000
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,520
heard a couple of my my 13-year-old

1001
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:52,960
students talking about you know the

1002
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,760

with uh the Washington football team and

1004
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,280
things like that and and they were like

1005
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,960
yeah it's disgusting it's disgusting and

1006
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,720
I said you know what I got something for

1007
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,800
you to listen to you got

1008
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,079
it and it's amazing because I don't

1009
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,319
think they get all the references but

1010
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,200
they will the winning of the West the

1011
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:14,400
Massac yeah oh my God yeah

1013
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,040
sign album that I got turned on to this

1014
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,800
is what made me eventually become you

1015
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,160
know involved with him the way that I am

1016
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,640

1017
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,319
a funny nightmare I am I'm a funny

1018
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,359
nightmare person because that first it

1019
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:35,119
scares me and then then I just hold my

1020
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,119
head the whole time going wow this is

1021
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,960
the best thing ever and electrician is

1022
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,480
like that about halfway through like

1023
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,200
life you get you're getting rugs pulled

1024
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,440
out all the way along but when you get

1025
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:51,079
to let me hear it for me you're under

1026
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:54,520
arrest smam it's your that owned me for

1027
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,040
life and it got me on to uh it made me

1028
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,240
want to listen to the rest of the stuff

1029
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,359
yeah and little those little little

1030
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,960
throwaway almost jokes like I'm give

1031
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,520
give me that gun but father I don't have

1032
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:09,640

1033
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,640
mine like those dumy dumy dummy you're

1034
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,400
all little and and because this thing

1035
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,960
switches on a dime from one place to

1036
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,680
another it's that great and you talk

1037
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,480
about that improv uh uh soul of it it's

1038
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,720
there because as soon as you think

1039
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,160
you've got that picture in your head you

1040
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,760
drop something on literally on top of it

1041
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,480
right next to you that you didn't

1042
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,880
realize was there which you know you

1043
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,880
can't do or at least I've never seen it

1044
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,839
done on improv on state sure you can

1045
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,359
only do it your mind well you get a

1046
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,160
little bit of it like when you see

1047
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,720
really good people at Groundlings or UCB

1048
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,200
specifically because you know like all

1049
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,520
of a sudden somebody will just say it

1050
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,559
was like yeah but then get off the

1051
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,839
submarine right like oh but it was such

1052
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,920
a nice tea party I didn't realize that's

1053
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,040
true you know but it's not the same

1054
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,839
because you've built a complete picture

1055
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,400
in yeah we we suck you in and then we

1056
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:01,200
spit you out if you will it's true and

1057
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
this was this one I just I mean and it

1058
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,480
happen so quickly and effortlessly the

1059
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,720
way on on the third track on side one

1060
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:12,720
the um 38th of kondo the way every piece

1061
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,280
of the scene suddenly you're cutting to

1062
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,400
the other point of view in the scene and

1063
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,000
because there's like two people in a

1064
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,800
scene you're cutting to person B and

1065
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,280
they start a scene with person C and you

1066
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,839
cut to C's point of view and suddenly

1067
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,240
they're in apparent teacher conference

1068
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,319
with somebody else who goes on the next

1069
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,160
thing who goes on the next thing you

1070
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,520
can't do that you you can barely do it

1071
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,079
very good good point Taylor and I I

1072
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:37,240
think what it what it really boils down

1073
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:39,280
to is that we were children of radio who

1074
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:43,319
then and and and

1075
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:46,720
movies okay and remember there was a

1076
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:50,280
marriage a CO Coalition between movies

1077
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,920
and radio they' put movies on radio and

1078
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,119
they and and radio shows would become

1079
00:48:52,920 --> 00:49:00,160
movies I've got a great uh um radio

1080
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,960
version of it's it's mury and the man

1081
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,359
you got it the first it's almost

1082
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,400
verbatim the whole thing unbelievable I

1083
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:12,119
know uh and and and then television came

1084
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:16,680
in so we were like really media babies I

1085
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:20,760
mean we were the first generation to to

1086
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:23,799
experience this evolution in in media

1087
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:27,680
yeah uh in my book I I refer to myself

1088
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:30,880
at one point as a Comedia n m

1089
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,359
because really I grew up with changing

1090
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,240
media and and I think that that's one of

1091
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:37,839
the other things that that the other two

1092
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,839
guys well three guys excuse me uh

1093
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,920
everybody uh assimilated and and had in

1094
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:46,520
common because this was an opportunity

1095
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:50,440
to commingle these sensibilities for the

1096
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:53,119
first time in one medium Y and reference

1097
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,480
all the others yeah and you see play

1098
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,799
with it even more especially when you

1099
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,839
get to something like uh um dwarf when

1100
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:04,359
you've got a movie on television right

1101
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:06,920
and you're doing it on radio you hit all

1102
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:11,559
three of them all at once and really the

1103
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:14,119
bottom line is it's a record it's a

1104
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,599
recording and that was what gave us the

1105
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:19,160
freedom yeah CU we can do anything we

1106
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:22,440
want on this people can take it home

1107
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:25,960
listen to it privately yeah and we have

1108
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,359
no restrictions other than to to create

1109
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,079
you know realize Vision yeah boy was

1110
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,799
that

1111
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:33,079
liberating so liberating okay I I'm
