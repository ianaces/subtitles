loudest gasp came from me my CD is

69
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,159
short but

70
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,760
satisfying and uh one of the coolest

71
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,159
things about the CD is uh well I

72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,280
recorded at a comedy club that I really

73
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,680
liked working and the with crowds that I

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,080
really liked so the CED went recording

75
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,599
went well I had good sets I was happy

76
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,040
about that but the most exciting thing

77
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,040
happened after whatever the production

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,720
or the engineering or whatever you know

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,959
was done to make the CD is uh the

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,319
artwork on the cover done by longtime

81
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,319
illustrator of Mad Magazine Mort Drucker

82
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
and uh you know I grew up reading MAD

83
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,720
magazine

84
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,439
had to be a huge influence on what I

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,879
think is funny and to have you know one

86
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,079
of the great caricaturists of all time

87
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,320
do the artwork for the cover it's just

88
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,720
about the coolest thing ever this book

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
is nothing but jokes that I've written

90
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,800
many of which have made it into the ACT

91
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,040
some of which wouldn't be in the ACT

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
unless of course I got a little

93
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,759
encouragement from the audience and it

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,479
gives me some the um permission to read

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,639
some that might be a little bit darker

96
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,600
and my favorite one that I close with

97
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,400
that are darker from the book is my

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,320
