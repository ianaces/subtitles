1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,800
hi I'm Tim slel and this is Tim slel

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,320
live uh this is the third video I did

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
all of them were actually done live I

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,560
don't know why we chose to call this one

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
live but we did uh we we kind of rushed

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,679
into it it was it it was I was doing I

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,719
was booked at the 200 libertarian

8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,600
National Convention and my distributor

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,280
says well we got to tape that and uh so

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,480
we did but I I I wasn't ready I had just

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,960
bought a brand new suit and uh the

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,399
tailor when I was getting it fitted uh I

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,520
said are you going to put belt loops on

14
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,640
it he goes no no the lay of the suit is

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,920
better when you don't wear a belt well I

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,960
did not realize that meant you had to

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,680
buy suspenders I I thought because it

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,519
was tailored it probably would fit so

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,920
snugly that it would just just be fine

20
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,080
without a belt I thought that's what he

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,880
was telling me um so as I was walking to

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,560
the stage in my new suit my pants

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,320
started falling down and I I I you will

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,240
notice in this video that I have my hand

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,759
in my pocket almost the entire time and

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,200
basically I was just trying not to

27
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,400
expose myself and uh uh I I've I've

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,000

doing these things man I've uh um I

54
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,599
think I think the first one I did was

55
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,519
Salt Lake City in 1992 and it was it was

56
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
a big experience for me because I I've

57
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,239
always heard heard stories about what

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
happened when they filmed The Wizard of

59
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,239
Oz how when all the munchkins got into

60
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,640
this movie Set have you heard about

61
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,440
these stories that that these were short

62
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,599
people who lived in Rural America all

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,239
over that never knew that they were

64
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,280
anything more than a circus freak in a

65
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,680
small

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,480
town and when they all came to Hollywood

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,360
all of a sudden they realized how many

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,360
people there were just like

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,320
themselves and that's what Salt Lake

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,439
City was for me was yeah

71
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,480
[Applause]

72
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,200
that's uh yeah that's uh I think I think

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,760
we need more events like this to en

74
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,640
encourage uh us to you know to realize

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,080
that we're more than just the freak that

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
lives at the end of the block that the

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
neighbors tell the kids to stay away

78
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,120
from yeah that man has

79
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,159

123
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,880
when I was when I was actually when I

issued

130
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,960
ID which which I was wondering what what

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,120
happens if you lose your license on

132
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,960

133
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,960

134
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,800
sovereign I'm sorry I can't go

135
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,840

here

140
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,800
so anyway I handed my government issued

141
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:14,919
IID to the uh um aot's uh government

142
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,919
employee that was disguised as a skyc

143
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,199
cap and he was typing in my name and as

144
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,720
soon as he I could hear see right when

145
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,960
he hit that last e of Slagle cuz he just

146
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
kind of

147
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,720
went and he just goes come with me

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,319
grabbed my bags and started walking to

149
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,080
this place of the airport I'd never been

150
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,319
before and I'm just what is this he go

151
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,319
it's just

152
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,479
routine and like a routine know everyone

153
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,000
else bag went on that that that little

154
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,000
card that would be the

155
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,280
routine you know my bags going into some

156
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,360
mystery

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,159
place and and there was this huge room

158
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,560
and there was there was actually a bomb

159
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:03,759
sniffing machine

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,199
which yeah which was you know funny

161
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,199
because on my carryon I had some

162
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,199
fireworks that I had

163
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,919
brought probably would have pegged a

164
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,240
couple of

165
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,639
needles but they didn't look for they

166
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,360
they wanted that and fortunately it

167
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,360
wasn't a pot sniffing machine

168
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,800
either cuz you would have been short one

169
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,800
comic if that had

170
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,719
happened so anyway so the bag goes on

171
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,519
the conveyor belt and it's going through

172
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:45,600
this machine and I go why am I here and

173
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:49,680
he goes well well your your name popped

174
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:54,399
up and I why why did why did my name pop

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,399
up and he said well it just happens at

176
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,279
random and I go well isn't that funny

177
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,560
that randomly I'm the only one in line

178
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
that's not a godamn

179
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,240
Arab so it was at that moment that I

180
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,760
realized I I was probably on El Gore's

181
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,760
profile

182
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,720
list well which is interesting because

183
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,160
you know if a cop says oh there's a

184
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,279
carload of black kids in a white

185
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,050

219
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,959
would be better if we all road trains

220
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,600
and or anytime a person in government

221
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,880

228
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,519
he wants us all to drive electric cars

229
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,279

230
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,680
him no no he still needs a limousine

231
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,880
motor Cade and dc9 you know he's talking

232
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,000
about you

233
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,880
people you people should drive an

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,760
electric like the the GM ev1 have you

235
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,240
heard about this first production the

236
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,000
car

237
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,720
$35,000 for a car with no heat or air

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,760
conditioning top speed about 60 miles an

239
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,760
hour for an hour before you plug it in

240
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,000
overnight oh where do I sign up for

241
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,920
that like Al Goran doesn't even see that

242
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,680
there might be a flaw or two with this

243
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,800
design sure you're going to have to make

244
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
some small

245
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:44,160
sacrifices I'm sorry two days to drive

246
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,279
100 miles is not a small

247
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,639
sacrifice further than a day in a

248
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,639
goddamn covered wagon than an electric

249
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,440
car yes but at least it'll help the

250
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,199
environment how does an electric car

251
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,199
help the

252
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,720
environment cuz you know the electricity

253
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,839
has to come from

254
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,160
somewhere it doesn't just grow out of

255
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,160
the

256
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,120
socket you have to generate it this

257
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,680
country we generate the majority of our

258
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,480
electricity by burning fossil fuel same

259
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,800
exact thing I'm doing under the hood of

260
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,800
my

261
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,839
car electric cars have exhaust pipes

262
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,839

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,399
people that that that thousands of years

277
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,839
ago would tell us that that if we didn't

278
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,160
throw virgins into the volcano that that

279
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,160
sea monsters would eat

280
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,199
us and then like there there would be

281
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,800

282
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:46,440

285
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,839
happen well no you you told us that sea

286
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,199

324
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,919

325
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,240
almost always elected a married

326
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,120
president in this country is that we

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,280
that button just by threatening to bite

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,240
this country if there was you would not

455
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:57,000

459
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,000
as a stray

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,399
they'll swim to the shores if they stand

466
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,640

00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,760
childproof trigger

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,399
weapon pointed at the head of a

539
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,679
in the third world people don't worry if

so so the animal rights people will poke

581
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,039
them with sticks

582
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,519
to get him to start stampeding and they

583
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,840
run out of the cages and get about

584
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,840
halfway across the road before

585
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,120
but but they're free red

586
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,360
spots which is I guess what we're all

587
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,919
willing to be

588
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,919
too one way or

589
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:21,919
another I I I I'm sorry I I I and I know

590
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,200
there's a few vegetarians in the room

591
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,600
and I I don't get

592
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,000
that and what I really don't understand

593
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:35,130
is what do vegetarians feed their

594
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,130
[Music]

595
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:44,720
cats a little weird to be a vegetarian

596
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,720
and keep cats because they all have

597
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,159
cats yeah you're usually

598
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,960
several I've actually heard some

599
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,200
vegetarians though that they decide

600
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,720
because they've become enlightened that

601
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,720
they will also Enlighten their

602
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,840
cat you heard they actually try to turn

603
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:11,360
their cat into a

604
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,799
vegetarian that's that's

605
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,880
goofy cat cats are meat

606
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,720
eaters they're Predators they have all

607
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,440
pointy

608
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,679
teeth they were put on this Earth to eat

609
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,240
small birds and rodents that's what they

610
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,480
do that's what they are all meat and

611
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,200
nothing but the meat that

612
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,279
there's actually a scientific term for

613
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,840
turning a cat into a vegetarian I

614
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,840
believe it's called starving the

615
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,039
[Applause]

616
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,639

I think we can take

630
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,849
[Music]

631
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,320
him any there's actually several level

632
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,480
levels of vegetarianism there's and you

633
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,840
know and and let me say right here if

634
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,240
you do it out of preference if you do it

635
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,840
out of religion that's your own business

636
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,960
I don't mind that and especially if it's

637
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,679
your religion I really respect that you

638
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,440
know I I love people to be able to

639
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,360
practice their own religion but admit

640
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,480
it's religion take out of the take off

641
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,960
the pig suit and get out of the state

642
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,600
house we have separation of church and

643
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,600
state in this

644
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,159
country there's there's of course you

645
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,679
know the the the the oval Act of

646
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,159
vegetarian that's those vegetarians that

647
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,440
are allowed to eat cheese and and eggs

648
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,520
and then there's the

649
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,599
vegans these These are the these are the

650
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,639
Twisted

651
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,720
ones these are the ones that won't eat

652
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,720
honey because it exploits bees

653
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,359
they won't wear leather shoes cuz an

654
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:37,839
animal shouldn't have to suffer to

655
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,359
prevent their toes from freezing off and

656
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,000
I think if you're a true vegan man you

657
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,560
should just strip yourself naked go

658
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,560
running into the forest and let the

659
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:50,159
animals Peck you to

660
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,159
death I love the animals more than

661
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,200
me there's actually a study a a report

662
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,160
on N March 23rd New England Journal of

663
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,920
Medicine a vegan a person that had been

664
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,000
a complete vegan no Animal product for

665
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,280
20 years went completely

666
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,359
blind you hear about this he had nerve

667
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,320
degeneration because of a vitamin B12

668
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:15,440
deficiency because he was such a pure

669
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,960
vegan he never touched Animal product

670
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,440
and hence went

671
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,280
blind which uh probably pretty hard to

672
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,520
hang out with your vegan buddies after

673
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,000
that

674
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,040
happens get hard to listen to that

675
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,440
humans are meant to be vegetarians when

676
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,599
you're bumping into

677
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,400
walls I don't think that people should

678
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,400
ever eat meat oh shut the hell

679
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,880
up and you know what I wonder if you're

680
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,880
a blind vegan can you have a seeing eye

681
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,240
dog I guess if the dog

682
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,400
volunteers and there's actually a lot of

683
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,079
people a lot of vegans don't go blind

684
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,280
not everyone does because you only need

685
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,599
a very little bit of vitamin B12 and you

686
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,119
can get it from you know sources other

687
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,560
than meat you can get it from cheese or

688
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:10,560
feal

689
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,440
matter it's why kids that are vegans

690
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,720
don't go blind because

691
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,839
they don't have sanitary habits that we

692
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,119
wish they

693
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,800
would so if you got a vegan buddy next

694
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,200
time you see him go like this right in

695
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,400
his eyes and if he blinks

696
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,400
he's got a nasty little

697
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,680
secret either he's sneaking

698
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,680
cheese or he's got some funny

699
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,560
Play-Doh then of course there's a third

700
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,080
variety ovala of vegan the third variety

701
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:54,200
of vegetarian the person who's dating a

703
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,560

704
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,720
fit into that category

705
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,200
oh I would bet the night Linda died Paul

706
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,200
grieved over a New York

you're just so narrow-minded you're just

713
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,599
so shallow you just have to put labels

714
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,520

727
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,920

for for eating macaroni cheese when you

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,440

cholesterol Rich beef fat almost

828
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,359
identical in chemical composition to the

829
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,480
stuff that Rings the outside of a steak

830
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,480
it just comes out of a different

831
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,520
[Music]

eat macaroni and cheese

835
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:32,480
cuz we all have this illusion of a dairy

836
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,839
farm that comes from watching too many

837
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,839
butter

838
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,640
commercials that when we picture a dairy

839
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,839
farm we picture a peaceful

840
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:49,520
pasture surrounded by snow peak

841
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:49,520
mountains every morning Heidi comes out

842
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:57,520
and a little milk made outfit L low cut

843
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:00,599
with ruffled panties and

844
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,599
coffee filter on her

845
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,200
head maybe Pats the cow a couple times

846
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:14,680
places a daisy behind her ear and grabs

847
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,839
the thick long hempen rope and leads her

848
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:20,079
back to the Milk Barn with a cowbell

849
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:22,400
clanging softly in the morning gentle

850
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,280
breezes sits on a rickety three-legged

851
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,119
wooden stool and M milks her with firm

852
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,400
gentle hands while she sings her

853
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,400
soothing songs from the

854
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,119
Homeland I would eat that

855
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,640
cheese but that cheese is 100% processed

856
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,920
American

857
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,599
fiction dairy farms are cruel places a

858
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,599
dairy cow will spend the three short

859
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,319
years of her life locked inside of a Yol

860
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,920
of a dairy barn in front of her snout

861
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,720
the only thing she'll ever get to see is

862
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,319
this SLO that hormones and steroids and

863
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,559
GRL come rushing by hanging off of her

864
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:00,400
utter is 525 5 lbs of milking equipment

865
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,760
that turns on three times a day and

866
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,760
won't shut off until it's

867
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,599
dry and there she's kept in a state of

868
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,480
permanent lactation till exhaustion and

869
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,480
calcium depletion makes her collapse at

870
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,680
her own brittle bones at which point

871
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,559
she's dragged out by the LA back legs

872
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,559
thrown down the Shute and turned into

873
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,680
hamburger that's the gentle dish that is

874
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,680
macaroni and cheese

875
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,839
see cuz the dairy industry is not a

876
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,240
career

877
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,240
choice for a

878
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,359
cow just a temporary

879
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,720
position kind kind of like Miss

880
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,760
America you based on the the the

881
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,760
plentifulness of your

882
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,680
utter you know what do vegetarians think

883
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,400
think that after cows are done with the

884
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,359
dairy business that they get to retire

885
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,520
that there's cruise ships of retired

886
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:10,160
dairy cows cruising around the Bahamas

887
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,160
playing Bingo and square

888
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,960
dancing and let me tell you the dairy

889
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,599
industry is not equal opportunity either

890
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,640
the dairy industry does not have any

891
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,640
jobs for the boy

892
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,800
cows well no you can't milk a

893
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,800
bow well oh okay you

894
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,960
can but you you don't get a

895
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,640
lot makes the cheese kind of

896
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,240
salty see the sad truth is that cows

897
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,920
were put on this Earth for one reason

898
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,839
and one reason alone and that's to be

899
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,160
consumed by a human

900
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,480
being if we stopped eating cows they

901
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,480
would become an endangered

902
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:07,760
[Applause]

903
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,559
species we kind of have this agreement

904
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,160
with cows in nature this is called a

905
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:13,839
symbiotic relationship is that we give

906
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,040
them life and in return they give us

907
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:19,040
food and clothing and comfortable car

908
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,760
seats we give them life and they protect

909
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,119
us for we protect them from disease and

910
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,839
predators they protect us from

911
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,839
starvation

912
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,160
cold

913
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:38,280
man a the only reason why a cow is ever

914
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,599
born into this Earth the only reason why

915
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,720
a cow ever gets to open her long brown

916
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:45,520
lashes on a sunrise is cuz some farmer

917
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,359
had his wrist up the hind quarters of

918
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,359
her mother with a turkey baster full of

919
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,040
bull and imagine if you will as that

920
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:56,440
farmer is about to compress that bulb

921
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,839
and bring another cow being into

922
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,000
existence that you're standing in front

923
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,440
of

924
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,520
God and God goes man I got I got some

925
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,839
bad news for you you're next in line to

926
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,119
be born

927
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:12,559
and and so's that

928
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:15,559
cow you're going to be a cow but but I'm

929
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:18,200

you'll have grain in the fall and hay

947
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,839
every winter and that's going to happen

948
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,400
for about 16 changes of season at which

949
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,880
point you're going to be led on a truck

950
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,599

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,980
we're just we're just a little bit away

1114
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:20,280
from bringing Melanie up

1115
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:23,000
[Applause]

1116
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,280
here there's a

1117
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,799
spirit I think I think one of the things

1118
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,760
probably that the bug bugs me out about

1119
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:31,680
Mo about the most about the prevailing

1120
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,960
culture right now is this whole fasc

1121
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,319
fascination with

1122
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,480
Europe how many you ever noticed that on

1123
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,760
the on the news and you talk to liberals

1124
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,160
and it's all the same thing well in

1125
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,400
Europe they have socialized medicine in

1126
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,839
Europe they have gun control and there

1127
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,079
doesn't seem to be any

1128
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:52,400
problem well you know what in Europe

1129
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,119
they have state religions and monarchies

1130
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,599
do we want that

1131
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:59,200
too yeah I'm so sick could being

1132
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:03,520
compared Europe is nothing more than a

1133
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,520
third world country with a very bad

1134
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:09,599
[Applause]

1135
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,640
attitude Europeans are nothing more than

1136
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,480
the descendants of peasants that didn't

1137
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,760
have the courage to overthrow the

1138
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,839
tyrants that run their little duchies or

1139
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,839
the ambition to immigrate to the United

1140
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:20,839
States

1141
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,839
W Europeans are hairy back Savages and

1142
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,680
have been a war with each other for

1143
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:38,359
thousands of years and would have

1144
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,920
annihilated each other twice in this

1145
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:43,039
Century if we hadn't have gone in and

1146
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,039
saved their greasy

1147
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,319
butts can't even agree on a Common

1148
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,280
Language and the languages they do have

1149
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:53,400
don't have wonderful words like we have

1150
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:57,839
here in America words like courtesy or

1151
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,839
gratuity or deodorant

1152
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,599
they say they like to drink their beer

1153
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:07,599
warm come on they don't have

1154
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:14,280
refrigerators in Europe a dishwasher is

1155
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,280
an apprentice

1156
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,559
ship they're so proud now that they

1157
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,680
finally got their common currency called

1158
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:23,880
the Euro this will replace their

1159
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:26,880
previous common currency known as the

1160
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,880
dollar

1161
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,640

1162
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,280
literate than we are well of course they

1163
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,280

01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:48,520
bayat just cu the entire continent is

1166
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:50,200
fascinated of the possibilities that can

1167
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,599
occur in a country where women can

1168
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,599
afford razors

1169
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,720
Europe is a vulgar Place full of crooked

1170
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:04,640
yellow teeth and tiny little cars where

1171
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,039
people live in cold water Flats with

1172
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,960
squat toilets devoid of toothpaste or

1173
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:11,079
toilet paper they spend dinner time

1174
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,000
eating parts of animals we Americans use

1175
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:15,319
for pet food and

1176
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,720
fertilizer wash it down with a couple

1177
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:18,480
gallons of wine and a carton of

1178
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,640
cigarettes praying that the combination

1179
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,319
of lung cancer and socialized medicine

1180
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,680
might mercifully shorten their miserable

1181
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,680
Little Lives

1182
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,790
