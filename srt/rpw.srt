game with an X it's really fun I

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,159

me to invite me to her wedding so I

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,719
guess she's winning yeah she's a natural

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,520
uh it was Weir she called me and she was

43
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,280
like hey Ro I'd love if you came to the

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,479

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,440
it's my wedding we've known each other

for a long time why just for one night

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,800
can't I have my cake and eat it

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,840
too uh I don't know maybe because the

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,920
cake has feelings ever think of that you

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,720
psycho maybe because meeting your

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,720
husband isn't the best way to keep the

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,720
cake stable like that's an option maybe

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,640
the cake might get drug and try to [Â __Â ]

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,200
you on your wedding night that's bad

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,120

60
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,360
side of the

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
