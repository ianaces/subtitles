00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,000
and something I don't know Spike

188
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,960
is who you are and what got you going

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
and what you got going into where you

190
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,159
born at little town called Paris

191
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,479
Missouri okay where did you come to Twin

192
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,039
Cities I came here as a young boy uh

193
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,840
went back and forth and then finally we

194
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,599
settled here MH yeah at what age did you

195
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,520
get involved with the Civil Rights

196
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:21,960
Movement I I think I was probably 15 or

197
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,159
16 I was probably paying attention when

198
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,639
I was 11 or 12 because in Missouri black

199
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,599
people went through the same things you

200
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,279
did in Alabama or Mississippi them one

201
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,839
side of the track most facilities uh

202
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,479
black people were not allowed in so I

203
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
was already being developed and I was

204
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,760
already telling my mother what I didn't

205
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,279
like as a young child and what did you

206
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,880
see that you didn't like as a young

207
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,800
child well just not being able to walk

208
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,040
into a show or a restaurant or go to the

209
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,360
Dairy Queen get an ice cream conb or go

210
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,760
to the carnival and get on the rides as

211
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,240
a matter of fact a lot of people don't

212
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
know but when we first came here to

213
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,279
Minnesota probably Liz would know

214
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,720
nicholet used to be called nicholet

215
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,519
Avenue instead of a mall and all the St

216
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,000
on nicholet Avenue was wws SS kesky

217
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,079
Powers WS sure all of them had a soda

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,200
fountain that faced the nicholet Avenue

219
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,440
side and when you walk in the opening

220
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,959
doors you walk into the soda fountain

221
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,320
all of them had at the napkin sign thing

222
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,760
that said uh we don't serve colors at

223
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,880
the time here Minneapolis oh yeah humy

224
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,959
was the mayor a lot of people don't know

225
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,440
that about Minneapolis okay so I went

226
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,800
through the same thing here and trying

227
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,360
to understand how you fit in and why we

228
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,920
were treated differently as a matter of

229
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,200
fact we went to a show where where uh

230
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,480
City Foods is used to be Super Value

231
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,640
there was one there called the brinmar

232
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,200
that was the black show mhm we had never

233
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,760
been to Broadway cuz we couldn't get up

234
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
on Plymouth if you were seen on Plymouth

235
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,760
the police would carry you back to your

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,279
community the projects itself where

237
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,440
summerfields Park is the east side was

238
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,839
black the west side was white a lot of

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,480
people don't know about Minneapolis

240
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
let's talk about Minneapolis when did

241
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,399
you start the fight you about 15 16 here

242
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,480
yeah I started with with a group of boys

243
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,279
that I grew up with okay and we used to

244
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,880
go downtown and run in and sit down at

245
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,640
the counters because we knew we couldn't

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,160
and they used to offer us water to get

247
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,920
us to leave so we keep drinking water

248
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
till we get bloated but we wasn't going

249
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,079
and uh we used to run into into

250
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,440
different places where we couldn't go we

251
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,800
used to run in the movie show take a

252
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,800
seat we used to do all of that here in '

253
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,519
66 that's when the violence broke out

254
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
not just here but throughout the nation

255
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,399
what was a climate like here in

256
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,959
Minneapolis in 60 6 that's when you came

257
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,640
to prominence well what it was then for

258
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,320
young blacks there was nothing for us

259
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,760
there was no jobs the most you could do

260
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,560
here was either shine shoes toss salads

261
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,160
or be a bus boy and we all knew knew

262
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,120
that and most of us wouldn't apply for

263
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,640
it and we were at the point of

264
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,040
hopelessness where you know what are you

265
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,600
do and who's trying to lead us out and

266
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,320
nobody was and when things hit the fan

267
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,760
across the country it naturally hit the

268
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,519
fan here at at that time Plymouth from

269
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,279
Queen Avenue down to humbled Avenue on

270
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,760
both sides of the street was all white

271
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,839
businesses there was nothing else there

272
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,760
but businesses right and came to the

273
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,720
black community the first time half of

274
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,360
it was destroyed and the second time the

275
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,279
rest of it was destroyed looking back in

276
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,959
retrospect was that a thing because we

277
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,600
burnt our own Community was that a good

278
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,079
thing to do I think that the media

279
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,279
projected that to make black people

280
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:07,839
think because something is in your

281
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,760
community is yours if you don't own it

282
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,480
you don't benefit from it it's not yours

283
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,360
but those it serves you those Merchants

284
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,120
were giving black people credit on food

285
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,480
they were serving they there there was

286
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,680
some good and and then after they burnt

287
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,519
out was years before anything came back

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,720
I think that was a conversation for some

289
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,160
towns I wouldn't say that was a

290
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,000
conversation for our town as a matter of

291
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,839
fact what kicked off the second Riot was

292
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,079
a young man who they alleged stole a

293
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,639
package hot dogs and when he got up to

294
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,000
the counter and the man told him to uh

295
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,360
pull out what he had in his pants he

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,320
pulled out the hot dogs he shot him with

297
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,040
a deer rifle so I don't see where the

298
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
connection was with the merchants in our

299
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,800
community you know okay the other part

300
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,360
is that the black community has to

301
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,000
realize that we have as much opportunity

302
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,279
and right to own businesses in our own

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,279
Community as anyone else this whole

304
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,720
thing of redlining is going on today

305
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,200
denying us equal access to having our

306
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,399
own businesses if you have your own

307
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,040
businesses you don't really have to be

308
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,560
concerned about discri you can hire

309
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,920
yourself right that's true that's true

310
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,600
we need that opportunity what brought

311
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,920
you into the spotlight what took Spike

312
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,360
Moss being one of the people that out

313
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,160
there protesting to being a leader in

314
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
the black community I think what you

315
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,040
know I was on a I was on a boxing team

316
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,079
at the time at the philis Wheatley and I

317
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,440
was downtown at the Aquino parade and at

318
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,440
the time they were trying to back

319
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,600
everybody up off the curb and some young

320
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,720
black girl about 14 years old was pushed

321
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,519
off the curb and uh an officer rather

322
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,839
than asked her to get back hit her with

323
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,920
a club H and he didn't know at that time

324
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,800
she was pregnant and um I was the

325
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,839
closest to it so I stepped out well

326
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,399
being a boxer and wellknown other

327
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,800
brother stepped out in the street but

328
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,279
from that day I made up in my mind

329
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,560

369
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,320
important but we need to moved from the

370
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,839
uh Black History Month and Incorporated

371
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,800
in our school system so our kids are

372
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,639
being taught it every year I think

373
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,160
what's important is is that it gives

374
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,120
kids the motivation and determination it

375
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,240
gives them back a sense of Pride uh the

376
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,639
self-esteem that our kids uh need so

377
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
badly uh to know exactly what role they

378
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,199
play in America I mean we begin with

379
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,920
American history but it's not that way

380
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:53,839
in most school systems and our young

381
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,639
people need to know that all that you

382
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,399
see in the world is not done by just one

383
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,160
part of society it's done by all of the

384
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,680
people who live here I think it's

385
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,880
crucial but I also think it needs to be

386
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,279
incorporated period no no doubt I think

387
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,480
that's very true you're out there in the

388
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,079
community and you're with the kids and

389
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,240
you see what's going on you deal with

390
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,920
the gang members you deal with the

391
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
street people you deal with white collar

392
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,880
blacks what is going on with so much

393
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,480
crime why is crime taking off so bad

394
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,040
here in our Twin Cities I think you have

395
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,600
to look at the level of discrimination

396
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
and denial of opportunities that just

397
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,000
finally caught up to us when you

398
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,880
devastate people to the level that

399
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,240
blacks have been devastated in America

400
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,040
we are now with families that are three

401
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
and four generations without a person in

402
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,079
your family that had a job

403
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,759
where you're raising all your family on

404
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,240
welfare mhm uh subsidized housing you're

405
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,759
getting whose fault is that though is

406
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,639
that their fault is that we got to

407
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,440
empower ourselves we have decided we

408
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,079
have decided as a nation that uh racism

409
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,240
is healthy and we're projecting it we're

410
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,920
maintaining it and it's a strangle hold

411
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,240
of people of color and it's keeping them

412
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,880
from being whatever it is they want to

413
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,360
be life in this country and I think as

414
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,920
long as you deny it people are still

415
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,279
subjected to the same thing as working

416
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,639
people on on the end of the month you

417
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,160
got to pay your bills if you don't allow

418
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:01,160
me to pay it with a job I'm going to pay

419
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,880
another way right one way or the other

420
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,319
what about the disrespect for life and

421
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,600
property people like the boy that went

422
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:07,480
in the house he broke in the woman's

423
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,079
house everyone heard about this story uh

424
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,279
and he was burglarized in the house

425
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,160
normally you a burglar you go in the

426
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,519
house I understand that you going to

427
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,920
steal something you take the TV VC and

428
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,720
get the hell out of there but the kid

429
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
stay then he takes a nap goes to sleep

430
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,639
waits for the mom and the babies to come

431
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,160
home and then kills the mom and cutting

432
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,000
the kids up I don't understand that

433
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,279
violence well you have to you have to

434
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,920
recognize this one of the things that we

435
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,759
try to ignore is that we're preoccupied

436
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,120
in teaching Americans citizens how to

437
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
behave mhm if you were five or six years

438
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,600
old in this country the first thing

439
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
you'd watch on TV is a cartoon right

440
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
most people look at cartoon as innocent

441
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,639
but you have to look at what you see

442
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,160
there is no cartoon figure that doesn't

443
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,519
steal something from the other one

444
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,680
doesn't bust the other one in the head

445
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,639
with something doesn't shoot him in the

446
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,440
face with a gun or fire a big hole in

447
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,639
the middle of his body with a cannon

448
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,880
you're already being taught to relish

449
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,680
and like violence when you get into the

450
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,440
movies it's Supreme uh Supreme uh what

451
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,360
you call it extreme rather violence when

452
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,079
you get into the movie shows where you

453
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,600
get in Friday the 13th or or or

454
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,319
Halloween or Jason all this type of

455
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,959
violence we're beginning to enjoy as

456
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,839
entertainment and we're also acting it

457
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,480
out in our society the kid get the gun

458
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,799
and he's got some power now what we're

459
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,240
saying is well you're supposed to be

460
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,559
intelligent enough to watch it and not

461
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,120
acted out but if you look at most

462
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,720
murders there has been that murder seen

463
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,199
on TV or a magazine or a comic in this

464
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,360
country before it took place what we

465
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,439
need to do to our young brothers and and

466
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,480
not just brothers but other people of

467
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,880
color to stop them from doing this stuff

468
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,600
well number one we're not teaching

469
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,960
people that they're important we're not

470
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
teaching people that we love them not

471
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,840
that they should love themselves what

472
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
we're doing to people is wasting them

473
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
and burning them up if you have an

474
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,559
attitude that no one cares about me I

475
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,799
don't need to care about you right

476
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,480
that's the attitude we're giving young

477
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,320
people in this nation the self-esteem

478
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,440
that's right that they're not and the

479
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,000
same time uh uh case in point when I was

480
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,480
a young man I couldn't go to the store

481
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,320
and get cigarettes I couldn't even get

482
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,640
them from my mother unless the merchant

483
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,320
knew my mother's signature a kid can get

484
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,120
cigarettes wherever he wants I couldn't

485
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,320
get alcohol a kid can get alcohol I

486
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,799
couldn't even see drugs let know let

487
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,679
alone know it existed these kids can get

488
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,720
drugs from adults that look like you and

489
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,520
me with no problem right so I'm saying

490
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,120
that the adults of this nation are

491
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,919
participating in the demise of the young

492
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,600
people of this nation that type of

493
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,440
Cruelty is coming back at us and then

494
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,039
we're acting like we don't understand it

495
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,120
a lot of times we we we blame society we

496
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,840
blame culture we cannot deny that but

497
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,760
here I'm a black man out here working

498
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,760
hard believing pushing and I believe I'm

499
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,840
going to make it and I am going to make

500
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,320
it cuz I look good shut up um but when

501
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,799
do we stop blaming and take some

502
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,760
responsibility upon ourselves our own

503
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,600
community and say let's push forward and

504
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,159
we got to do this in ourselves I think

505
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,919
you're doing both but you're not in a

506
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,559
position to change the demise of your

507
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,000
people you're not in position to offer

508
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,600
an alternative to them when you say

509
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,960
something to them if I say something to

510
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,360
a young man who's selling drugs on a

511
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,000
corner what am I going to offer him to

512
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,840
get him off the corner it's all right to

513
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,760
come at him and tell him the evils of

514
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,360
that but in fact that's his living

515
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,520
that's how he eats now how am I going to

516
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,320
feed him we haven't moved to that level

517
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,320
where young people can come to us and

518
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,880
get the very things they need therefore

519
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
they step out in the world and start

520
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,480
trying to get it on their own which

521
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,400
usually ends up to be negative right and

522
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,960
it's not a thing of blaming it's the

523
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,520
reality of of the demise we're in I know

524
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,280
you must have recognized that recent

525
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,720
study that said the two worst states in

526
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,760
this country in terms of the treatment

527
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,840
of people of color were Mississippi and

528
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,600
Minnesota now you have to realize

529
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,640
Mississippi does not count because it's

530
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,280
the poorest state in the Union it has no

531
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,080
industry couldn't help us if it wanted

532
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,159
to how did Minnesota get to the bot

533
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,799
that's a good question I tell you what

534
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,480
we're going talk about some more

535
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,840

little bit time here so we got hit the

572
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,400
stuff real quick here now when I told

573
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,039
people out in the community I said Spike

574
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
Moss is going to be my show this weekend

575
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,679
I heard a lot of positive stuff but

576
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,039
there was a lot of negative reaction to

577
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,480
you being on the show they say well

578
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,760
Spike ain't nothing but out for himself

579
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,960
and he's out for the money he does

580
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,760
nothing but chase down television

581
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,799
cameras what would you say to that stuff

582
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,799
there well I'm overdue to get the

583
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,400
money I think the work I do is going to

584
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,440
draw some cameras and uh I think you

585
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,520
said the magic word whenever people of

586
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,520
color speak about their demise of

587
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,039
freedom is controversial right I think

588
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,240
if I was speaking about freedom in

589
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,200
Russia at the time when it was Communist

590
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,240
I would be considered as a controversial

591
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,679
person how has a person controversial

592
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,360
who speaks about freedom in a free

593
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,080
country unless in fact you're trying to

594
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,039
tell me because I'm black I have no

595
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,279
right to speak on freedom good answer

596
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,360
man I like that I like that another

597
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,400
quick question for you something that

598
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,039
You' been getting a lot of impressed

599
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,279
about is that when a lot of black

600
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,600
suspects are suspected of crimes rather

601
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,159
than going and surrendering at the

602
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,799
police station they're coming to you

603
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,320
United for peace and you're escorting

604
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,120
them down to be arrested why is there

605
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,080
the need for that well I think you got

606
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,279
to look at the reality of people telling

607
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,559
those young men or their families that

608
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,720
we don't want you in we're going to

609
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,159
murder you we're going to kill you the

610
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,159
reality is if we didn't have as many

611
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,400
brutal beatings or killings in this town

612
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,279
maybe you could believe you could make

613
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,400
it in M but I mean this is a town with a

614
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,480
tall history of black males shot in the

615
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,600
back of the head and shot in the back

616
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,960
and to this day not one person has been

617
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,799
uh found guilty for any of those

618
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,640
killings of black people by law

619
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,480
enforcement as a matter of fact I said

620
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,440
at the courthouse press conference

621
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,760
yesterday this is the only town or city

622
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,000
or state in its history of having a

623
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,600
police department where no matter what

624
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
case has been brought against our police

625
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,159
department they have been found not

626
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,600
guilty they are 100% right every time

627
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,440
there is no police St station nowhere

628
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,960
that is 100% right on every case right

629
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,679
