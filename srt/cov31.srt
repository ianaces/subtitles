41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,040
a

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,640
kidding well I I I've heard that in my

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
own home we we hit a Jewish

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,360
Family well uh I've heard that there

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,880
were many Germans we hit them for a

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,039
while and then turned them over to B St

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,960
you know sir what did you do personally

48
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,960
during the war oh well I was a baby

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,719
during the war I was maybe four or five

50
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,560
years old it was terrible I mean I

51
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,080
didn't know what what's going on I you

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,760
were so confused sir just a moment

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,239
little German little German Tykes for

54
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,959
confused well sir it's hard for me to

55
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,040
believe that you were a little German Ty

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,599
because you look to me to be a man of 60

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,319
65 years old oh well you know we had

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,000
nothing to eat and I I've aged terribly

59
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,760
all right everybody Welcome to Comedy on

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,480

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,920
Scott Aran hello Jason hello all the

64
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,280
ships at Sea um so why did you pick this

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,200
particular album I know you said you

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,519
didn't listen to on vinyl first but no I

67
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,720
listened to it on tape which is an old

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,480
format that

69
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,200
uh I I guess it actually is tape I don't

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,760
know it's literally like tape that you

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,920
would you would put through a machine

72
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,239
and it would it would uh sounds would

73
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,920
come out of it oh is that how that

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,000
worked yeah it's uh it's pretty it's

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,799
pretty old I know you mainly work with

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,560
vinyl but this is a pretty old format

77
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,159
sure sure sure um casses your Superior

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,879
sound quality and M actually I I may

79
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,360
have

80
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,400
heard I'm trying to remember but uh the

81
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,319
first track I ever heard from it was the

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,319
uh 2,000-year old man track uhhuh and I

83
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,120
heard that as part of a different set I

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,920
might have had that on CD but it that

85
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,280
probably was tape to but that was uh

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,000
part of the American

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,439
comedy box set I believe I don't know if

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,799
you've ever seen that or I have seen

89
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,879
yeah yeah most of it is

90
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,480
pretty uh undistinguished MH or classic

91
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,000
in a way that wasn't really I wasn't

92
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,680
really relating to you know like I can't

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
remember what's on there but stuff to

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,879
the effect of say who's on first is on

95
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,599
there sure it would be you know just

96
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,280
kind of a recording of Who's on First

97
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,439
and I wasn't really you know responding

98
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,200
to it but then that track was on this

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,400
box set and I immediately just really

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,879
sparked to it yeah and I I think the

101
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,599
reason I picked it

102
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,120
is not because it's the album that I've

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,919
listened to the most um out of Comedy

104
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:20,120
records cuz that would maybe be um Bill

105
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,199
Cosby himself probably or something like

106
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:28,040
that but I I think I picked it because

107
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,560
it has excuse me it has the most direct

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,400
influence on what I do right now now it

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,440
it's really a lot like what I do on the

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,240
podcast and and what I'll be doing in

111
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,120
the TV show sure so and I I think that

112
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
that

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,639
was kind of unconscious in my mind until

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,479
recently recently I started thinking

115
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,720
about these records and I realized oh

116
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,800
wow this is

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,960
exactly what I have been doing yeah I

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
didn't even put two and two together

119
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,000
until you brought it up and I'm just

120
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,960
holy [ __ ] this is Perfect 2 and two

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,160
equals 4 that is now we all realize but

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,199
at the time who knew no nobody you know

123
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,639
it

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,039
was but yeah I I I picked it for that

125
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,759
reason mainly because I think it's had

126
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:13,120
the most um influence on my work um so I

127
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,800
think that what I responded to it back

128
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,400
when I first heard it back in probably I

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,759
think I heard it 1993 1994 mhm um my mom

130
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,919
I don't know if you have this experience

131
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,120
do I don't know do you have parents I

132
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,840
have at least two so if you ever develop

133
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,080
an

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,919
interest um or a hobby or or something

135
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,759
of that effect um my my parents will

136
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,759
then try to give me Christmas gifts or

137
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,080
birthday gifts relating to that hobby

138
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,919
sure so I think back in

139
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,759
1994 when I first heard it I think I was

140
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,960
I had an interest in comedy I hadn't

141
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,639
started it yet but I had an interest in

142
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,280
it so that's why I got that box set yeah

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:02,520
um and what what I really responded to

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:06,280
it I remember is The Improv nature of it

145
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:10,120
yeah the um the fact that Carl Riner is

146
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,039
trying to trip up Mel Brooks yeah and

147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,319
Mel Brooks is trying to overcome

148
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,400
questions that he's just thinking of on

149
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,240
the sure yeah and you can really hear it

150
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,479
on the record I mean I think that these

151
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,720
records are so successful

152
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,639
because um they're not just recitations

153
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,120
of like a script that those guys wrote

154
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
right yeah yeah yeah it's a stick but

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,759
not in the same way I mean it it it

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,880
doesn't have to repeat itself every time

157
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,360
I mean the most recent one they did was

158
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,680
I think it was a year 2000 it wasn't as

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,000
good but you know they can still do it

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,000
yeah and you know I mean take Abid and

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,560
Costello doing who's on first sure okay

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,120
so they worked out that routine they

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,680
probably worked on it in their live you

164
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,360
know routine over the years but they

165
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,720
honed it down to a script sure and it's

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,960
a really tight script and they perform

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,639
it as a routine on TV shows they did it

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,319
in movies yeah but it's there's

169
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,680
something lacking in the scripted part

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,639
of it that really shines through on this

171
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,800
record because these guys are making it

172
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,160
up as they go along yeah um and when I

173
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,280
when I first heard it it was at a really

174
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,960
influential time it's it's really right

175
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,919
before I started doing

176
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,960
comedy um I heard

177
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,759
this which made me go out and buy the

178
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,639
box set of all the records of course um

179
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,680
I Heard

180
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,240
or I saw an Andy Kaufman special on NBC

181
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,360
that they I forget why they were um

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,000
airing it but I I really had no idea

183
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,639
about Andy Kaufman's life or or career

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,280
other than he was on Taxi was that the

185
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,440
one did they interviewed you was it late

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,919
enough that Jim Carrey was interviewed

187
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,280
in that one I think it was Jim Carrey

188
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,639
was Interview that's the first special I

189
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,800
ever saw about him too yeah I had no

190
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,960
idea who he was really other than he was

191
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,000
the guy on tax so it was relev or

192
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,720
revelatory rather I keep mispronouncing

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,879
that word that's fine I do too I say re

194
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,680
but yeah that my my I was my parents

195
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,599
would tell me yeah of course Andy

196
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,159
Coffman did that [ __ ] and I was kind of

197
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
pissed off that they didn't tell me

198
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,000
anymore right cuz he didn't really I

199
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,759
mean he had he had a couple of specials

200
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,080
I think which you can still get but he

201
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,599
didn't put out a comedy record or

202
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,840
anything and that's mainly how I

203
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:23,240
listened or or saw comedy cuz I didn't

204
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,199
have HBO sure um you know Comedy Central

205
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,520
wasn't really a thing at that point you

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:33,200
know so so I I saw Andy Kaufman I saw

207
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,000
Bob and David do their live show leading

208
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,279
up to them getting Mr show uhuh and it

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,279
was called the cross Odenkirk problem

210
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,480
okay and then I and I listen to this and

211
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,800
those three things I

212
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,320
think I would say the cross Odenkirk

213
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,120
thing and the Andy kopman thing had more

214
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,640
to do with what I was doing back then

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,839
when I first started and I sort of

216
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,040
forgot about these records sure and we

217
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,720
did a um uh BJ Porter and I who were in

218
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,120
something called called the Fun Bunch we

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,160
we did something influenced by these

220
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,320
um where I was the Mel Brooks person and

221
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,279
he was the Carl Riner guy interviewing

222
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,680
me but that was just one bit out of a

223
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,120
lot of bits that we did back then so I

224
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,720
haven't really thought about it very

225
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,240
much but when I started thinking a few

226
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,760
months ago about these records again I

227
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,920
realized holy [ __ ] this is exactly what

228
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm doing right now yeah um so I listen

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,680
to him again and it's it's really kind

230
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,040
of

231
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,560
fascinating to listen to back when I

232
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,440
first listen to it I always imagined I

233
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,920
would be the Mel Brooks guy sure sure

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,000
you know being the funny guy who's

235
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,120
coming up with and riffing with stuff

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,040
off the top my head but now it's

237
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,079
interesting doing what I do now to

238
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,079
listen to it and be paying attention to

239
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,920
Carl Riner a little more and seeing what

240
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,120
he's doing and how he's leading Mel

241
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,680
Brooks into stuff and which is kind of

242
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,360
what I do on the podcast yeah I noticed

243
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,360
more and I should we should mention even

244
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,399
though there's no way they haven't

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,079
listen to yours if they're listening to

246
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,360
mine but comy bang bang is obviously the

247
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,720
podcast and the the IFC show there's so

248
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,160
many ways yeah when does wait when does

249
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,160
the show start on IC IC show starts June

250
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:10,120
8th June 8th okay um but uh I told on

251
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,320
that show yes on that on that show you

252
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,240
know if people haven't heard it it's

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,200
basically I'm the host character and I'm

254
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,760
interviewing Real people but then I'm

255
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,320
also interviewing characters which is

256
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,959
what Mel Brooks does on these records he

257
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,279
doesn't just do the 2,000 year old man

258
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,720
by the way which maybe a lot of people

259
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,839
don't know but he does several

260
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,640
characters on each record the only one

261
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,399
that he did um the 2000 man for the

262
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,639
whole time was the fourth one and maybe

263
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,360
they did a fifth one out I think since

264
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,800
then so but the 2000 year old man was

265
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,200
the uh most successful stand out and

266
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,480
then they did a film of it a short film

267
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,079
which I think did some shorts yeah if I

268
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,639
remember correctly they also did it and

269
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,720
speaking to the improvisational nature

270
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,639
of these they did it um on several TV

271
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,720
shows like maybe the Steve Allen Show

272
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm not sure but they they had to script

273
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,480
it for that yeah so it just Mel Brooks

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,240
hated doing it supposedly and it just

275
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,519
lost everything that kind of made it

276
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
special I bet about it um but if you

277
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,320
haven't heard my show I I do want to say

278
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
this if you haven't heard my show it's

279
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,560
me talking to real people and then

280
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,720
talking to characters a lot akin to what

281
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,440
Mel Brooks does on this and my role on

282
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,440
it is

283
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,560
to we never know where it's going we

284
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,959
never plan it out so my it's my role to

285
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
either uh lead it and steer it into a

286
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,320
direct

287
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,519
that I think is worthwhile exploring and

288
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,200
also sometimes to trip up the person or

289
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
to press them on a on a point sure and

290
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,240
make them come up with something in the

291
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,200
moment which is I think what makes my

292
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,959
show so unique yeah yeah you force them

293
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,519
in a lot of ways I really love that

294
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,200
about the show uh sir are there any more

295
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,440
secrets you're ready to divulge about

296
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,360
why and how to live 2,000 years well one

297
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,880
of the big things that's kept me rolling

298
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:02,399
along singing a song is uh garlic

299
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,480
garlic has kept you alive how can garlic

300
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,120
keep you alive well garlic keeps you

301
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
alive because well you know how you die

302
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,680
don't you the scientific reason how you

303
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,199
die is that the angel of death

304
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,040
see Rings your apartment Bell and you

305
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,839
let him in and bang you know comes comes

306
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,320
in and says okay muray this is

307
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,040
it and and so how how does garlic how

308
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,519
does garlic help usually comes at night

309
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,680
right so before I retire I'll eat myself

310
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,839
a nice pound and a half garlic

311
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,740
then I lay down in bed and I pull up my

312
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:41,360
crazy

313
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:45,240
[Laughter]

314
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,639
quilt and I'll uh starting to retire and

315
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,440
snore and how does the garlic help well

316
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,959
the angel of death you know comes in he

317
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
comes over to me Taps me on the shoulder

318
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,000
I say who is

319
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:00,199
it and usually he goes woop he takes

320
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,240
right off door well that's an

321
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,040
interesting Theory sure you know about

322
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,120
the kiss of death right sure he not

323
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,560
going to kiss me I'm full of goet but I

324
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,360
mean you're that's one thing that I was

325
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,360
thinking about listening to this as well

326
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,920
Carl Riner who we've seen play plenty of

327
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,440
characters I mean this is not he's a

328
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,639
straight man but he's got enough of a

329
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
character he's willing to laugh you do

330
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,800
similar thing on your podcast he laughs

331
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,480
a lot more actually in the second and

332
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,920
third one it's really interesting if you

333
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:30,240
listen to the first one he he almost

334
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,839
Riner kind of sounds like he

335
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,320
is worried the whole time you know

336
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,519
because if if people don't know the

337
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,839
background of these

338
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,920
records this was something they did at a

339
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,360
party which you know back in the would

340
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,040
have been the late 50s I think cuz this

341
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,920
came out in ' 61 maybe yeah um parties

342
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,240
were the original podcasts yeah I don't

343
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,160
know if people remember that but people

344
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,240
used to have parties instead of Hosting

345
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,519
podcasts so um so they would do this at

346
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,240
parties um where it was just kind of

347
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,079
like a party game where Carl Riner would

348
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,839
to Mel Brooks and ask him a weird off

349
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:07,759
ball off ball Oddball question offthe

350
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:11,800
wall and Oddball question um so they'd

351
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,800
be they're a couple of off balls MH um

352
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,199
and and Mel Brooks would launch into

353
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,240
this and so they they were um doing this

354
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,880
at a party and Steve Allen was there and

355
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,320
insisted oh you got to make a record you

356
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,720
got to make a record and they were

357
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,519
saying no I don't think so it's too

358
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,720
inside sure no one would think this is

359
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:35,720
funny it's too Jewish was another thing

360
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,680
that they T yeah and then George Burns I

361
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,320
believe came up to them and said are you

362
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,920
making a record and they said no I don't

363
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
think so he goes okay I'm going to steal

364
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,360
it

365
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,639
then and which is a common thing back

366
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,279
then you know of course so they said oh

367
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,040
[ __ ] we got to make a record so they

368
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,120
went and made this record so if you

369
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,639
listen to Carl Riner on the first one I

370
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,600
think this is before it's a proven thing

371
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,880
before he knows if any anyone will think

372
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,560
this is funny or not so he sounds very

373
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
worried and trying to steer it and

374
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,440
trying to rain it in and trying to

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,600
control it a little more which um I I've

376
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,040
been there so I know exactly especially

377
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,720
when you don't have a lot of time um

378
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,360
you're constantly trying to rain

379
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,800
something in and and make it not go off

380
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,240
the rails too much you know like if you

381
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,519
only have 15 minutes with a person

382
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
you're constantly trying to get him back

383
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,880
on track he sounds like he's constantly

384
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:31,880
trying to get Mel back on track but then

385
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:35,319
the second and third records he laughs

386
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,800
more he seems more at ease with it it's

387
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:39,279
been it's a proven thing and which is

388
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,199
sort of where I'm at now where I can

389
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,079
just kind of like relax a little more I

390
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,000
tend to laugh at the bits a little more

391
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,959
and um yeah it's kind of an interesting

392
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,360
difference it seems to I mean obviously

393
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,920
it's an amplified version of you too

394
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,680
what where where do you come yeah

395
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,319
exactly it's where does it come from for

396
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,160
you I mean is it just you [ __ ] around

397
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,440
with your own sens of humor or you how

398
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,160
are you amplifying you well I mean I

399
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,399
I've I've said I've said this recently

400
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,880
but um I do view the

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,240
character that I do on the show as a

402
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,279
character um it is an amplified version

403
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,160
of my own personality obviously my

404
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,279
personality sometimes leaks in like I

405
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,120
can I can hear it on the show if I ever

406
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,920
listen to them which I try not to sure

407
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,880
but um if I ever listen to one back I'll

408
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,519
go oh that's me dropping character and

409
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,639
actually having a real moment okay

410
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,800
um for instance uh we're recording this

411
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,839
the week uh uh Bobcat go weights episode

412
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,160
came out and sometimes I I um if I have

413
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,839
someone on for the first time I'll tend

414
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,360
to do a lengthy interview with them I

415
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,319
think that one lasted maybe 30 minutes

416
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,000
or something before I bring a character

417
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:52,399
in um just to acclimate them to the show

418
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,600
so not too much craziness is happening

419
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,000
right from the start so when I T when I

420
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,600
do the real interviews with someone and

421
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,120
I've known Bob for a long time but I'm

422
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,679
not you know as comfortable excuse me

423
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,439
with him as as other people I tend to um

424
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,600
be a little more real and and be a

425
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,839
little more I am sort of like a good

426
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,760
interviewer searching for an inn sure to

427
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:21,559
make a joke or to lead the conversation

428
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:24,280
into a a humorous Place yeah but I do

429
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,199
think that for the most part if I had my

430
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,039
brothers I would do the show with people

431
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,160
who get it all the time yeah and we

432
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,520
would never talk about anything real it

433
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,840
would just be fake bits the entire time

434
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,280
but you can't always do that cuz the

435
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,000
show is different every week I don't

436
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,840
have you know paa tonkins is maybe the

437
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,840
closest to a person or or James adomi is

438
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,679
closest to a a regular and even he only

439
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,919
does it every month or so so you know I

440
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,240
have to work with different people every

441
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,280
single week so it's a little more akin

442
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,559
to a talk show yeah which is interesting

443
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,200
for me because it's a um I mean it's

444
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,679
that's where the format sort of

445
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,280
developed of talking to real people

446
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,240
mixed with fake people because if I had

447
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,919
a group of people like Paul F or James

448
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
or Seth Morris who were on every single

449
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:11,840
week I think the show would have would

450
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,440
have gone into a different direction

451
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
where I just talk to crazy people every

452
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,400
week yeah yeah yeah yeah and then the TV

453
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,039
show probably wouldn't have happened

454
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,600
because that's a big part of the TV show

455
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:24,120
is the celebrities that I can get on the

456
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,600
show and and involve them in the

457
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,440
craziness okay

458
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
um is

459
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,600
is this was this I doubt it but I mean

460
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,919
was it your first exposure to Mel Brooks

461
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,080
or is it just your first exposure to

462
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,400
this side of Mel Brooks no I you know I

463
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,480
mean I I think you know I grew up in the

464
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,000
7s I think I grew up in the 70s let me

465
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,880
check yeah I grew up in the' 70s okay um

466
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,200
so you know I I was aware of Blazing

467
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,000
Saddles I was aware of of Young

468
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Frankenstein I think I probably saw them

469
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,240
edited on TV a lot so like I knew who he

470
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,440
was and I you know Space Balls came out

471
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,760
and I I remember when it came out just

472
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,120
thinking oh you're parodying Star Wars

473
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,640
now you know it was as I recall it was

474
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,320
like three maybe four years after Return

475
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,600
of the Jedi came out and at the time I

476
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,880
just thought that was an eternity like

477
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,280
you know now of course like Robot

478
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,120
Chicken is still parodying Star Wars you

479
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,080
know it doesn't family guys do you three

480
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,799
full parties of yeah so it's you know I

481
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,760
don't know what my problem was at the

482
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,080
time I still have not seen Space Balls

483
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,280
uhhuh because I just was like that looks

484
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,080
corny and it's not going to hold up so I

485
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,280
think I think I had a thing against not

486
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,120
against Mel Brooks cuz I always knew to

487
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,280
respect him but I I was just not

488
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,640
interested in him sure so when I heard

489
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,880
this I got very interested in him I went

490
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,880
back and Revisited Blazing Saddles Young

491
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Frankenstein The Producers all those

492
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,640
quickly became some of my favorite films

493
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,240
sure and so yeah I mean it was it was

494
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,120
really what made me sort of ReDiscover

495
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,360
him and they they say that this is like

496
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,559
the most Mel Brooks of anything he's

497
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,120
ever done mhm like it it it really is

498
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,520
you know in in Blazing Saddles or

499
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,480
whatever he has a script he's works on

500
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,280
it for months this is just pure like his

501
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,760
mind operating at a level of instinctual

502
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,320
comedy which is just amazing to behold

503
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,360
it's probably it's probably the closest

504
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,080
picture you're going to get to what he

505
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,159
was like behind the scenes of like your

506
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,520
show shows as much as people said he was

507
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:31,559
a raging dick like it's still probably

508
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:35,520
the funniest he's he is um is uh well

509
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:38,159
then I guess the like do you at all miss

510
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,559
having comedy albums just physically in

511
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,400
your hands is that something that was

512
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,400
ever important to you it was I mean it

513
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,120
was very important to me I the first

514
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,159
record I ever bought was Bill Cosby

515
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,640
himself yeah um and the Foot Loose

516
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,880
single nice um but so so I I was really

517
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
into

518
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,120
that and I didn't even know it was a

519
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,559
movie until I was maybe 15 and my

520
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,799
teacher showed it in the class really

521
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,480
strange really but um I listen to that I

522
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,720
I listened to Billy Crystal's marelus

523
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,799
record over and over and over awesome um

524
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,159
and uh you know Eddie Murphy and I

525
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,360
I someone got a hold of me recently an

526
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,559
old friend from high school to let me

527
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,640
know that he had my Joe

528
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:28,840
Piscopo Eddie Murphy uh Honeymooners rap

529
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:32,400
12 in oh my God that um that uh he had

530
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,200
borrowed and um so and I play a lot of

531
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,080
Comedy music on on my show so I

532
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,720
definitely do I listen to Dr Demento

533
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,279
every single week Weird Al Yankovic

534
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,360
veryy into it's I mean it's one of the

535
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:49,440
major Thrills of my life to actually

536
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,600
sort of know him now you know I mean if

537
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
it's one of those things where it's very

538
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,279
common to say if I could have only told

539
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,480
myself when I was age whatever but

540
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,559
that's one of the big ones for me of of

541
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,760
I was so upset when I couldn't go see

542
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:06,760
him live mhm in 1984 I think for his

543
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,919
in3d record [ __ ] yeah I was so upset my

544
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,760
parents wouldn't let me go for some

545
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,760
reason MH and just to like be able to

546
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,279
say hey you're not only you going to see

547
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,400
him you're going to hang out with him

548
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,760
you'll get he'll be on your TV show you

549
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,640
know it's a major thrill for me so do I

550
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,080
do I miss having records I do but at the

551
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,120
same time um I'm around so much comedy

552
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,000
right now that that personally I don't

553
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,720
miss cuz I just don't know I mean I I

554
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,640
still get records from all my friends

555
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,919
and stuff and it's out I mean comedy is

556
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,480
out there more so than ever if you want

557
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,559
to get it but I just personally don't

558
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,720
have a lot of time to to I I have the

559
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,720
Richard prior box set of all of his

560
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,559
records I haven't listen to a single one

561
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,039
I've had it for seven years maybe I

562
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,080
still have not listened to any of them

563
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,480
so that makes sense you have a chapter

564
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
here sir entitled your mate controls

565
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,840
your weight would you explain that

566
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,320
that's quite true I think it's

567
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,520
self-explanatory but I will you want me

568
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,799
to Yes it isn't self-explanatory you

569
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,559
mean if you're happy you gain weight yes

570
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:11,640
uh no not at all oh contr my dear Fair

571
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:13,720
no uh actually uh as far as controlling

572
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,000
weight is concerned let's say you have

573
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,240
uh a bulldog for a wife now you're going

574
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
to keep your nose and your mashed

575
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,840
potatoes at dinner and you're going to

576
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,080
eat your strain beans and you're not

577
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,279
really going to pay too much attention

578
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,360
to it you don't want to look up let's

579
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,679
say you're married to uh one of them low

olders or some something if you've got

582
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,840
the guts to do it I never have I'll

583
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,080
follow him for a block or two and then

584
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,200
that's it

585
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,200
you the

586
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:44,120
end for

587
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,640
um son of a [ __ ] I did it again I had a

588
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,159
[ __ ] complet oh you such a good

589

592
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,360
obvious I'm just going to sit back I'm

593
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,240
going to let the magic happen so much

594
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,440
you're just going to hit me with it and

595
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,880
and we'll just uh reel it okay all right

596
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,520
I've forgotten it again no but uh uh are

597
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,279
there I've talked with a few people

598
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,720
about specifically like sketch comedy

599
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,080
albums this I mean this is obviously

600
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,320
improv there there there's sketches I

601
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,039
usually think of sketches as something

602
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,400
that's written yeah but um are there any

603
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,000
cuz again you're in the comedy world are

604
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,000
there people releasing sketch comedy

605
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,360
albums that I'm not realizing because

606
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
that's something that I miss personally

607
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,960
I just saw yesterday that this group The

608
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,480
Midnight show who does a UCB yeah uh

609
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,840
they're releasing one awesome um

610
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,120
I talked about doing one at one point

611
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:39,840
actually as records wanted me to do One

612
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:43,799
MH and um it just uh is not something I

613
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:48,799
can focus on right now but um yeah I

614
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:50,919
mean I tried before before I had uh The

615
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,640
Comedy Bang Bang podcast I actually

616
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,840
recorded one

617
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,880
episode of a more

618
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,679
sketchy podcast uh with um Paul rust and

619
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,520
Neil Campbell uhhuh and those were we

620
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,919
had some sketches but we mainly had

621
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,120
ideas for sketches that we would Riff on

622
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,440
and you know a good sketch is like 2 and

623
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,760
a half minutes 3 minutes we would do 14

624
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,279
minute of course long 15 minute long

625
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,799
sketches where we never even got to the

626
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:24,760
game of the sketch until minute 8 cuz it

627
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,279
was just us riing and being idiots and

628
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,799
doing anti-comedy so I'm definitely

629
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,799
interested in the form I used to listen

630
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:35,279
to the Monty Python recordss a lot and

631
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:39,559
um but at the same time I mean a lot of

632
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:42,600
times those existed because it was

633
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:44,559
difficult to get to see sketch back in

634
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,399
those days sure it's not that difficult

635
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,000
now I mean you may as well just like you

636
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:51,200
could almost

637
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,480
say that any group would put out 12

638
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,159
funni or Die videos that's an album

639
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,760
right there you know what I mean so is

640
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,200
uh if if you were to do one if that does

641
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,320
happen would it be all improv or I don't

642
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,320
know I mean there's something

643
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,279
about that's the thing is is right now

644
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,039
if I wanted to do a sketch I could do

645
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:16,039
it um on the TV show or or for fting

646
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,720
your die or something like that so but

647
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,760
at the same time when I was doing a a

648
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,960
sketch

649
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,080
show a few years back we wrote all these

650
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,279
amazing sketches for it that just we'll

651
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,640
never see the light of day you know like

652
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:31,720
Bob Odenkirk is a guy who he writes a

653
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,679
great sketch he puts it in a drawer MH

654
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,360
and then

655
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:39,440
he will pull it out at at a certain time

656
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,799
actually on the uh the fifth episode of

657
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,640
of my show he does a character on it

658
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,440
that he has been thinking about doing

659
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,520
for 20 years I believe holy [ __ ] he's

660
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,799
had this idea for 20 years he's talked

661
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,960
about it with a few people oh my God he

662
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,720
happened to talk about it with the

663
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,320
birthday boys who are a sketch group and

664
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,320
uh two of them are writers on my show

665
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,640
and they brought up oh Bob has this

666
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,720
character that would be perfect for your

667
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,240
show and so we asked Bob to do it and he

668
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,480
just you know he'd been sitting on it

669
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,039
forever that's insane he did that for

670
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,159
the Jimmy Kimmel show too where like

671
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,960
he'd been talking about this one

672
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:19,799
character he wanted to do of a jack

673
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:23,000
Lan um guy who has a lot of energy who

674
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,640
exercises all the time like an 75 80y

675
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,480
old guy and who

676
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,200
then you off a bunch of his makeup and

677
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,799
he's wearing old age makeup and that's

678
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,760
why he has so much energy and it's all a

679
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,840
sham I forget exactly what it was but

680
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,120
but he talks about that sketch forever

681
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,480
and then he just kind of ran out of

682
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,559
places to do it you know we tried to get

683
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,960
a sketch movie going and all sorts of

684
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,640
stuff and he ended up just doing it on

685
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,159
the Jimmy Kimmel show cuz he's like I

686
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,000
don't want to waste this idea so he just

687
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,039
did it there that's hilarious but um I

688
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,320
would almost rather do a sketch movie

689
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,679
the great thing about an album though is

690
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,120
you can record it really easily you know

691
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,640
I have the podcast company which we

692
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,279
could record it there I mean Mike

693
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,640
detective is a lot like a sketch record

694
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:12,279
Mike detective is a a podcast that we

695
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,760
did last year we did 13 episodes I think

696
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:17,799
um a serialized 5

697
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,720
minute um 5 to 10 sometimes minute

698
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,000
episodes I mean so that's like if you

699
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
listen to those back toback that's like

700
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,799
a sketch record sure it's produced like

701
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,600
a sketch record it's very influenced by

702
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,640
them um but yeah maybe I mean who knows

703
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,480
the great thing about about it is I

704
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,559
would probably put it out through though

705
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,480
as a podcast through my company ra and

706
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,120
then turn it into a record or something

707
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,120
like that people wanted to buy it they

708
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,919
yeah God that' be amazing have you had

709
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,480
the opportunity to meet Mel Brooks or

710
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:49,200
Carl Riner no the closest I've come is

711
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,720
there's a producer who runs uh red hour

712
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,840
Ben Stiller's um production company

713
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,320
steuart cornfeld who's a great guy I've

714
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,399
worked with him on a few projects and he

715
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,519
used to be Mel's

716
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:05,919
assistant maybe that maybe uh not as

717
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,600
good of a job title as I he may have had

718
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,600
but I think it was assistant so he's

719
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,120
told me a lot of stories about him but

720
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,679
that I couldn't even repeat but um

721
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,519
that's the closest I've ever been I I

722
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:20,440
love Mel Brooks I would love

00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,279

724
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,080
lot nowadays but I would love to just

00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,840
meet him and has he done a podcast I

726
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,240
feel like he might have done a few I

727
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,159
just I would like to hear I've never

728
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,120
heard of him doing a the last thing I've

729
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,000
ever I ever saw him do was that dick

730
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,880
Cavit conversations with Mel Brook's HBO

731
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,960
show that was on about a year ago okay

732
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,440
all right which Carl Riner was in the

733
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,480
audience and stood up and like asked Mel

734
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,640
a question and they spent like five

735
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,159
minutes on Carl Riner I was like that's

736
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,799
what I want to see I want to see Carl

737
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,320
Riner and Mel Brooks talk to each other

738
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,880
not dick

739
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,880
CIT all dick Cavit would do is like tell

740
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,039
stories that someone else told him yeah

741
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,440

00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,440
from the uh oh oh no I'm fine thank you

743
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,080
so

744
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,720
much this sounds like an episode of

745
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,960
heer's Playboy club but a you want

746
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,399
another drink

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:16,279
H um uh did you ever make any friends

748
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,799
over comedy oh oh yeah meaning when I

was a kid yeah I yeah yeah I mean

750
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,399

to albums together watching anything

752
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,760

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,679
14 I I my best friend who was a couple

755
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:38,360
years older than me we we uh met in

756
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,440
theater mhm where we were doing a U

757
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,440
production of Carousel Rogers and

758
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,200
Hammerstein's Carousel so I met my best

759
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,760
friend there and we had very similar

760
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,360
interests um in terms of Comedy we were

761
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,200
very this is 1984 1985 so we were very

762
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,399
into Saturday Night Live um which at the

763
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,679
time was the 1985 season with Billy

764
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:03,480
Crystal yeah the mentioned Billy Crystal

765
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,320
and um Christopher Guest and Martin yeah

766
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,279
so we would

767
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,440
reenact that all the time we were

768
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:12,279
constantly doing the synchronized

769
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,200
swimming hey you hey you I know you I

770
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:16,279
know you we were doing that we were

771
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,840
doing Harry Shear voices we were doing

772
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:21,559
Christopher Guest stuff I mean Billy

773
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,039
Crystal for all the you know whatever he

774
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,760
is now yeah I was majorly influenced by

775
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,480
him when I was 15 I would do all the

776
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,880
Impressions that he did yeah would walk

777
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,080
around you know I I was in speech

778
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,039
competitions I would I would

779
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,960
do voices we had to do something called

780
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,760
extemporaneous I believe which was like

781
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,200
they give you a topic and you Riff on it

782
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,799
for for 8 minutes and I would just do

783
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,639
like comedy it would I'd slip into

784
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,200
Impressions Impressions that Billy

785
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:53,039
Crystal did or impressions of like

786
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,440
Reverend Jim or you know stuff like that

787
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,159
so we were really into SNL we were

788
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,880
really into Letterman who's probably my

789
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:06,279
second or he's he's probably my biggest

790
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,960
influence on on the TV show yeah um so

791
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,720
those two things and we were into stuff

792
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,840
like the hitchers GU to the Galaxy we

793
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,880
were really into

794
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,480
um uh but the th you know I would say

795
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,240
those two things were the big things for

796
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,159
us we would constantly watch SNL and

797
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,960
Letterman every single night did is it

798
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,840
do you think it's important for people

799
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,639
uh learning comedy to copy the the way

800
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,120
you did I mean does I feel like it must

801
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,600
happen for everybody you know when

802
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,000
you're

803
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,039
[Music]

804
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,559
15 you know I was also doing speeches

805
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,760
where I just basically they would call

806
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,880
it hi or humorous inter turp which was

807
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,360
you take a script and you you do the

808
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,880
script so I was doing like Mighty Python

809
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,679
and the Holy Grail just like doing

810
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,200
impressions of all of them you know but

811
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,399
when you're 15 or you're growing up you

812
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,760
don't really know well I mean that's not

813
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,399
there are a lot of smarter people I

814
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,039
think but at the time

815
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,720
all I knew was I really loved comedy I

816
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:05,080
don't know that I thought I could ever

817
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,960
do it sure but you you don't know that

818
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,679
hey you know you're not supposed to just

819
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,320
like imitate people you should actually

820
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,720
create your own stuff and and that's not

821
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,720
to say I didn't I definitely I had my

822
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,480
own Public Access TV show awesome I was

823
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,720
super influenced by Letterman and

824
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:25,000
probably ripped off his cadences or his

825
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:28,360
sardonic nature but but um definitely

826
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,320
created my own stuff for there but um I

827
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,799
you know I remember

828
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,799
reading um an interview with radio head

829
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:41,679
when they put out okay computer and they

830
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:43,360
said that they were basically imitating

831
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,320
some other band I can't remember who it

832
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,120
was they were trying to do an imitation

833
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,880
of that band yeah and it came out they

834
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,039
couldn't imitate the band so it came out

835
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,000
the way it came out right and that's

836
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,720
sort of what art is in a way I mean

837
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
everyone's influenced by something and

838
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,039
you get ideas and you try to sort of

839
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,799
imitate for a while and then it just you

840
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,919
develop your own style what did you do

841
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,639
2,000 years ago to entertain each other

842
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,240
Wing well no were there were were there

843
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,280
comedians oh sure sure we we you

844
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,879
remember any of them 2,000 years ago

845
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,720
primitive days let me see I remember one

846
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,639
comedian gave us some laugh boy we were

847
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,560
hysterical what was who gave us some

848
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,240
good laugh Mari the nut what what did he

849
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,159
do oh did he give us a laugh a tiger

850
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,639
came in the cave one afternoon Saun it

851
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,280
in Uninvited naturally nobody asked for

852
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,399
Tiger to walk in I here right tiger came

853
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,800
in and Murray you know the the Joker the

854
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,520
tumbler you know the nuts he jumped up

855
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,599
and he grabs the tiger by the table goes

856
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,240
and he went yaha yaha yaha and the tiger

857
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,440
turned around and ate him up in a minute

858
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:49,359
and then we get

859
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,480
hysterical we left that J that the best

860
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,079
joke we ever had well sir that's not

861
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,879
very funny that's well why did we have

862
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,000
RKO then that's all we had yeah but I

863
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,359
mean that I would consider that that was

864
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,280
the best we had M took a that was

865
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,359
entertainment but I would consider that

866
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,119
in the realm of tragedy rather than

867
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:09,640
comedy how do you differentiate between

868
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,520
point of view to me tragedy if it is if

869
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,520
I'll cut my finger that's tragedy it

870
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,400
bleeds and I'll cry and I'll run around

871
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,560
and I'll go into Mount Sinai for a day

872
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,760
and a half I'm very nervous about

873
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,920
it and to me comedy is if you walk into

874
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,079
an open sewer and die what do I care

875
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,280
that's comedy I see that's your my

876
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,320
finger is important see want to stick to

877
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,720
the album but if if if you would talk

878
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,800
for a second about how you got involved

879
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,960
with Mr show and what the first steps

880
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,640
were to just becoming well I you know

881
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,960
like I said when I started um those

882
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,200
three things the the Kaufman The

883
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,480
2,000-year Old Man and the and the Mr

884
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,400
show thing happened around in the same

885
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:56,280
summer as I recall okay or the

886
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,520
same right before summer mhm probably in

887
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,079
March or something I think I still have

888
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,319
the the flyer to the Cross Odenkirk

889
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,720
thing I think it was in March um those

890
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:06,880
all occurred around the same time and

891
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,839
and the reason they had such a big

892
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,280
impact on me I think was because at the

893
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,599
time I was I was I'd moved back from LA

894
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,319
to La rather MH from um doing musical

895
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,800
theater across the country oh all right

896
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:21,640
um which is what I thought I was going

897

919
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,599

924
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,960
um so I was kind of [ __ ] around I

925
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,000
didn't know what to do and I had a u

926
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,400
friend that I had done theater

927
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,480
with whose roommate was Karen kilger

928
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:48,880

go hang out with her every once in a

930
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,240
while and she

931
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:59,119

935
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,960
takes kind of an interest in people he

936
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:12,720
always like that's one really

937
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,040
interesting thing about Bob is like if

938
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,520
you just meet him he'll be very

939
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,760
interested in you and want to ask you a

940
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,280
bunch of questions so he asked me oh I

941
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,760

wrote for get a life and all this kind

948
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:38,960
of stuff so I was kind of hanging out a

949
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,800
little bit in the comedy scene but um

950
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,200
when my friend Mala

951
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,200
said hey you know I read your script and

952
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,079
I don't really like it um you know it's

953
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,520
like halfway between a drama it's like I

954
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,119
don't like the drama part of it yeah but

955
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,839
you're a really funny guy why aren't you

956
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,800
writing funny scripts sure and why

957
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,119
aren't you why aren't you doing comedy

958
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,960
and I was like I don't think I could do

959
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,520
comedy I I don't know you know I I had a

960
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,000
sense of humor that everyone found to be

961
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,760
annoying which which was

962
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,680
is is to say that what and what I found

963
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,400
out is that um people found it annoying

964
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,280
because

965
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:25,760
people people don't like people trying

966
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,880
to be funny right like basically I had I

967
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,839
had uh I was a waiter mhm

968
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:35,760
a Chinchin here in LA and all the other

969
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:38,960
waiters whenever I acted like what I do

970
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,920
now they would get annoyed and say stop

971
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,160
trying so hard or something okay cuz

972
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,960
people I don't know if you noce this

973
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,520
people hate funny people they do yeah

974
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,960
they hate people who are actually funny

975
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,720
sure until what happened was I started

976
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,480
doing comedy mhm I started doing comedy

977
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,240
and all of a sudden I could say oh I'm a

978
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,599
comedian they went oh that explains why

979
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,920
he's acting that way and then no never

980
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,040
had a problem with think you're an

981
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,560
[ __ ] until they know you

982
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,079
professionally okay all right that's

983
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:06,079
interesting so in any case I I just I

984
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,079
always I I got this feedback from

985
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,440
everyone that I just was annoying and

986
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,960
that my sense of humor I was like my

987
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,359
sense of humor is too out there what I

988
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,359
find funny I don't think anyone else

989
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,760
would find

990
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:21,560
funny um so I don't think I could be a

991
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,680
comedian she goes well okay my roommate

992
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,040
is in this show they do it every Sunday

993
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,880
night at The Comedy Store you know why

994
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,520
don't you just go up one night and try

995
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:35,280
something mhm um so BJ and I talked

996
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,800
about it and we came up with this bit we

997
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,560
we weren't really comfortable being

998
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,960
ourselves but we we thought we would do

999
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,000
a bit which was we were a fake um improv

1000
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,560
group who we took a suggestion from the

1001
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,119
audience and then it just I I forget how

1002
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,440
but it devolved into BJ [ __ ] me in

1003
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,640
the

1004
00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,200
ass um

1005
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:02,160
so I and I remember doing practicing it

1006
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,599
a few times for BJ's girlfriend at the

1007
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,040
time and we show we showed it to her and

1008
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,160
she just was like

1009
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,599
well all right that's not going to go

1010
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,880
well and uh and that and I literally

1011
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,480
thought it would not go well but for

1012
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,920
some reason we have this belief that it

1013
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:23,400
was really funny uhh so we did it and it

1014
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,119
really did well um it it it you know

1015
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,359
just like this because no one knew who

1016
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,440
we were and they thought we might have

1017
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:31,720
actually been a really bad improv group

1018
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,839
and it I remember when the sketch turned

1019
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:39,040
and it turned into and everyone got it

1020
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:41,680
just this amazing waves of laughter um

1021
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,720
and and then we got asked back to do it

1022
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,520
you know two weeks later and we became

1023
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,760
regulars at it um so that's how I sort

1024
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,440
of got into comedy and which leads into

1025
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,520
Mr show which is Bob Odenkirk who I'd

1026
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,400
met at that bar who probably didn't

1027
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,319
remember me cuz I was just some idiot

1028
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,800
who said he wanted to be a writer he was

1029
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:02,119
at the second performance that one two

1030
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,720
weeks later that's awesome because it

1031
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,920
was people doing the show it was it was

1032
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,599
the people in the scene as we called it

1033
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,599
it was your Dana Gould your Janine

1034
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,720
graffo your David Cross John Anis Bob

1035
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:19,680
Odenkirk Margaret Cho um so every Sunday

1036
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,800
night everyone we knew who was in comedy

1037
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,040
would be there yeah hanging out watching

1038
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,079
if they weren't performing they would

1039
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,119
watch the people so Bob was in the back

1040
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,440
and um

1041
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,760
I forget exact oh I do remember that bit

1042
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,520
it was the one where

1043
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,480
BJ ended up peeing in my

1044
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,480
mouth at the end of it to humiliate me

1045
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,400
and

1046
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,440
I spit it out and was crying and I said

1047
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,000
I hate you I hate you and I I would run

1048
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,800
out of the room that's usually how our

1049
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,319
bits ended is me saying I hate you I

1050
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,440
hate you and then running out of the

1051
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,720
room so I ran out of the room and I had

1052
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,119
to I had to basically run out of the the

1053
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,160
belly room of The Comedy Store which is

1054
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,319
upstairs so I had to run

1055
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,960
downstairs then go around to the main

1056
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,640
room of the comedy store and then run

1057
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,200
back up through the back and stuff so I

1058
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,680
was out of commission but BJ he ended

1059
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,359
and he just got to walk back into the

1060
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:17,520
crowd and Bob was in the back and he

1061
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:21,960
came over to VJ and said hey um that was

1062
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,240
so funny um do you guys um do you guys

1063
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,960
want to maybe write for my TV

1064
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,359
show um and you know considering cross

1065
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,720
noen Kirk who by the way I left out

1066
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:36,680
seeing them made BJ and I kind of go oh

1067
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,440
wait our senses of humor are maybe not

1068
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,119
that far off from what could be good

1069
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,280
because they were doing stuff that was

1070
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,359
sort of what we would do around the

1071
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,200
house to amuse ourselves and we were

1072
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,680
like oh and that in the Andy Coffman

1073
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,760
thing and the 2000-year old man thing we

1074
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,720
were like oh there's stuff out there

1075
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,359
like what we're interested in right so

1076
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,440
to have him ask us that was like oh you

1077
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,760
realize you're the reason we're doing

1078
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:03,440
this for the past two weeks you know so

1079
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,960
and you know it took I still I think it

1080
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,440
took still two years for him to make

1081
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,200
good on me writing on the show but still

1082
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,240
at the time it was like a huge boost I

1083
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,400
think from then on it was like our

1084
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,839
second show went really well Bob asked

1085
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,319
us to write on a show at that point I

1086
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:21,640
think it was like I considered myself to

1087
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:25,200
be a comedian yeah Jesus God listening

1088
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,680
to you describe those sketches um

1089
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,359
reminds me that there there is something

1090
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,119
about your humor and the humor of your

1091
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:33,960
podcast where despite the fact that you

1092
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:36,119
are going through the paces of yes hand

1093
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,160
and all that that [ __ ] you do break a

1094
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,040
lot of the rules in a really creative

1095
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,800
way is that important to you is it

1096
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,079
conscious it's interesting I

1097
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,200
[Music]

1098
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:49,040
mean I part of the part of the issue for

1099
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,839
me um as a performer

1100
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:56,359
is the

1101
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,720
UCB improv uh or the UCB school out here

1102
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:00,480
in LA

1103
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:05,040
improv didn't come around until

1104
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,359
2005 I believe okay so um and most of

1105
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,880
the Improv that that was out here

1106
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,640
previous to that I didn't really respond

1107
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,480
to okay um but I really responded to the

1108
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,440
UCB School of it so part of the issue

1109
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,520
for me as a performer is I didn't by the

1110
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,480
time UCB came here I was already a

1111
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,359
35-year old man and I taught sketch at

1112
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,480
the in the first you know when the

1113
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:31,680
school was the first sketch teacher you

1114
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:35,079
know so I thought it was weird and I'd

1115
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,920
been on Mr Show and i' you know I've had

1116
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:41,160
sketch shows I thought it was weird to

1117
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,720
take improv classes know I still think

1118
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,760
like I still think about oh I should

1119
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,000
take some improv classes but but I just

1120
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,559
feel weird doing it of course you know

1121
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,520
around 20-year-old kids you know what I

1122
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,079
mean and I would have to go through

1123
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,599
level one I mean everyone has to go

1124
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,119
through all I I hate those people that I

1125
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,119
hear about who are kind of famous who

1126
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,520
come in and go can't I just go right to

1127
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,760
level three I don't want to be around

1128
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,520
beginners right no I mean you have to

1129
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,680
you know so I've always felt weird about

1130
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,319
it mhm

1131
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,680
so and I always sort of Envy the people

1132
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,000
like you know Paul rust or Neil Campbell

1133
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,240
who were really young when the school

1134
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,359
first opened they went up through the

1135
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,920
the the ranks and they they took level

1136
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,720
one immediately and now they're cuz I I

1137
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,040
see the freedom in their performance

1138
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,200
that is so fun yeah um that I wish I had

1139
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,000
that background so I don't have that

1140
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,559
kind of background you know so when you

1141
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,280
say breaking the rules I like have a a

1142
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:39,119
general sense of what the rules are of

1143
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:42,680
improv right but I think a lot of my

1144
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,760
style especially earlier on in the show

1145
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,680
was about breaking the rules about doing

1146
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:50,160
bad improv as I said you are a member of

1147
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,559
the new wave school that's right try to

1148
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,839
do the new wave pictures now what is

1149
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:57,760
your picture about it's it's what is it

1150
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,760
called by the way rape

1151
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,440
what well could you tell us a little

1152
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,200
about your picture some of the how does

1153
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,440
your picture open well we started to

1154
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,240
with a with a new wave we uh the camera

1155
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,079
Waits until there's a good wave coming

1156
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:13,400
in and looks like a new wave and you

1157
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,680
filmed it we filmed that wave and then

1158
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,440
the wave breaks and when the wave breaks

1159
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,599
there's two people on the beach raping

1160
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,599
each

1161
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,319
other I see and what are you trying to

1162
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,440
say in your film we're trying to say

1163
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,440
that there's much immorality in our

1164
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,640
society

1165
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:34,400
I see and you show this by uh by showing

1166
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:36,839
a lot of rape and filth and dirt and

1167
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,200
people love to see the immorality so

1168
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:42,559
they know not to do that I I see but

1169
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:45,000
very ethical and moral is there anything

1170
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,640
in the film that would be well other

1171
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,599
than rape I mean you can't do a whole

1172
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,319
film no no no then there's the near the

1173
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:54,520
end there's Contrition where the uh all

1174
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:58,440
the raped people feel that they have

1175
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:00,599
done a dirty thing them is there a hero

1176
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,200
in the picture oh yes the avocado man we

1177
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,960
have an avocado picker who comes to a

1178
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,520
Grove of avocados and the people somehow

1179
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,559
know he's symbolic of goodness and the

1180
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,160
avocado cu the avocado is good yes and

1181
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,520
he walks through the Grove and the all

1182
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,480
the people are very contrite and they

1183
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,520
cry about the their rape and their

1184
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,960
Terror and they follow him to the church

1185
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,200
to pray for their salvation I see so

1186
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,360
Happ and on the way to the church the

1187
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,079
Turkish Army comes and rapes them all

1188
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,599
[Applause]

1189
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,880
because we like to finish a picture with

1190
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,200
a rape you know yes so it ties it up but

1191
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,319
that there's something in anti-comedy

1192
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,920
that I really respond to that that Neil

1193
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:41,119
and Paul and I when we did that podcast

1194
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,880
I mentioned that was all about

1195
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,680
anti-comedy of like a good sketch is 3

1196
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,440
minutes well we're not even going to get

1197
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,319
to it for eight right right we're going

1198
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,200
to we're going to [ __ ] with each other

1199
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:56,880
and try to um derail everything mhm and

1200
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,079
make each other laugh until until

1201
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,040
finally one of us brings up the sentence

1202
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:03,520
that we said would start the sketch you

1203
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,240
know what I mean so and that is really

1204
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,520
really funny to me there's some and

1205
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:10,160
that's a lot what this record is to me

1206
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,200
is um Carl

1207
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,720
Riner trying to steer it and then Mel

1208
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,040
Brooks trying to derail it you know and

1209
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,040
that's that's what a lot of great comedy

1210
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,359
is is is derailing each other is you

1211
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,520
know when when Carl Riner on this record

1212
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:27,839
says did you know

1213
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,559
Michelangelo um you know you know Mel

1214
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,640
Brooks

1215
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:34,520
saying oh yeah I hated him is derailing

1216
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,160
it in a way you know what I mean like

1217
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,960
because you expect him to go oh yeah I

1218
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,280
knew him he was great I always had a an

1219
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,880
appreciation for his talent you know for

1220
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,640
but for Mel Brooks to go yeah he was the

1221
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:50,000
first guy to use a roller only on the

1222
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,160
backgrounds you know it like so good you

1223
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,960
know it that's what a lot of Comedy is I

1224
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,400
think so so as far as breaking the rules

1225
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't have as firm a grasp on the

1226
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,839
rules as I wish I had you know but

1227
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,799
um but it you know yeah it is a little

1228
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,000
bit a little bit of that definitely it

1229
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:07,680
seems like those are a different set of

1230
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,240
tools for if if you need them though to

1231
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,720
be fair I mean not to say that we don't

1232
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,720
always have something to learn but I I

1233
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,960
feel like listening you know it it your

1234
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,760
style of humor is its own thing I guess

1235
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,319
I can understand you saying you want to

1236
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,119
do you take traditional improv if you

1237
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:27,319
thought you'd be comfortable doing it

1238
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,920
but it what to you is the appeal of of

1239
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:30,920
I feel like a lot of what Andy Kaufman

1240
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,520
did as far as you know anti-h humor like

1241
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,079
you say is is obviously the severe end

1242
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,319
of what they're doing on this album and

1243
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,559
sort of there's a discomfort aesthetic

1244
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,640
but is that do you think that's the

1245
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,720
reason it's done is it done to challenge

1246
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,880
people is it artistic or is it just done

1247
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,040
I don't know there there a number of

1248
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,400
different reasons you could do it you

1249
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,240
know another another a couple of of the

1250
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,559
other records that I could have picked

1251
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,240
um are Steve Martin's records which were

1252
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,559
also he my friend

1253
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,119
back in high school those were the other

1254
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,200
things that we listen to all the time we

1255
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,680
listen to him in his car driving around

1256
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,520
all the time and that's a lot of anti

1257
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:12,559
comedy or what I view as as anti-comedy

1258
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:14,920
so um what is its role I

1259
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,440
mean you know it

1260
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,880
it I think I think a lot of times it's

1261
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,440
just kind of like breaking you get tired

1262
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,119
of doing the same old thing you know and

1263
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,559
Steve Martin could have I don't know

1264
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,480
that that he could have been a regular

1265
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,079
comedi yeah com you know I don't know

1266
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,640
that he could have been an observational

1267
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:34,240
comedian I I don't think his brain works

1268
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,400
that way you know what I mean and as

1269
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,000
much as I've tried being an

1270
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:43,440
observational comedian I've done standup

1271
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,280
um I I gave it up I didn't give it up um

1272
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,559
I still could do it but sure but I my

1273
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,040
interests don't really lie that way

1274
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,000
because I'm I'm a little more interested

1275
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,760
in in stuff that is different than that

1276
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,720
you know so I don't know I don't know I

1277
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,240
mean Kaufman just was on another level

1278
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,599
of stuff that you couldn't even conceive

1279
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,680
of anyone doing at the time yeah you

1280
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:07,520
know um and and certainly my my humor is

1281
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:10,559
not at that level I'm you know very

1282
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:13,359
influenced by other stuff doing kind of

1283
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,799
a letterman meets peeee pasti on the TV

1284
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,760
show and you know but still trying to

1285
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:22,200
make it my own voice you know yeah so is

1286
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,000
there any level preparation for the

1287
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,880
podcast other than here's the name of

1288
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,880
the is it even that far I mean you know

1289
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,400
I was thinking about this this a lot

1290
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,119
because of this record and I was you

1291
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:37,079
know reading um when I was Rel listening

1292
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:38,960
it to it to do to do this um I also read

1293
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:42,200
a bunch of articles about it and just

1294
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:47,280
tried to get back into what I really

1295
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:49,440
liked about it and um these guys I mean

1296
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,000
you when I say that Carl Riner sounds

1297
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,960
like he's trying to Corral something in

1298
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,119
the first one I think that they had like

1299
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:59,760
little pre-planned bits sure um

1300
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,799
that worked really well at the parties

1301
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,760
that Carl was trying to get Mill to do

1302
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:06,920
because he knew we're making a record we

1303
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,680
got to get these pre-planned bits going

1304
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,400
a little bit and so to answer your

1305
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,079
question I think that my show used to be

1306
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:17,119
a little more like that okay um when I

1307
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,720
first started having characters on it it

1308
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,160
was because I'd seen the characters do

1309
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:26,079
these bits on stage so I'd seen Andy

1310
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,720
Daly do um this character in a 10-minute

1311
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,760
bit mhm so I think one of the first ones

1312
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,760
we did was the

1313
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,400
uh that I

1314
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,880
remember really well is the guy who

1315
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,960
wants to commit suicide by buying a

1316
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,400
heavy coat and going into the ocean I

1317
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,760
can't remember his name but um I think

1318
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,480
I'm pretty sure I'd seen that bit on

1319
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,359
stage okay so early on I was sort of

1320
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,200
doing what Carl Riner was doing on the

1321
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:55,920
first record which is trying

1322
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59,640
to ask the questions that will set up

1323
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,599
the bit yeah yeah um so like iin for

1324
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,119
instance Brett Gman I brain thing even

1325
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:07,319
though I'm acting with mock uh

1326
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,599
indignation I'd seen that bit several

1327
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:14,240
times I knew it backwards and forwards I

1328
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:16,559
knew when to interject and and act like

1329
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,960
it was upsetting to me you know so early

1330
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,799
on in the show it definitely was a lot

1331
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,280
more like that but

1332
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,319
then and and sort of goes hand in hand

1333
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,599
with the fact that I don't have any

1334
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:29,680
formal training I I sort of was like I

1335
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:31,760
don't know how funny I can be I'm I

1336
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,640
should be more I I knew because I'd been

1337
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,880
on Jimmy paro's never not funny that I

1338
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:39,440
was a relatively gregarious guest sure

1339
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,559
sure and so I figured I could I could be

1340
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,280
that as a host I would just be kind of

1341
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:47,640
funny every once in a while but I I do

1342
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,839
remember the moments and I think it was

1343
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,440
it was on that um heavy coat one with

1344
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:57,319
Andy daily where I started just really

1345
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,280
asking pointless questions to him

1346
00:54:57,319 --> 00:55:02,000
to try

1347
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,520
to supposedly to try to flesh out this

1348
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,880
story but in my mind to derail him and

1349
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,319
to make him come up with things that he

1350
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,079
wouldn't come up with and there was some

1351
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:12,359
weird magic about it where I started

1352
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,720
really focusing on the coat and where he

1353
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:17,520
bought the

1354
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,640
coat and he would he sort of answered

1355
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,160
the question he's such an amazing

1356
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,559
improviser he answered the questions for

1357
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,119
a while but then like turned it back on

1358
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:25,599
me like why are you so obsessed with the

1359
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,640
coat I feel like we're getting off on on

1360
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,640
a on on I feel like you're focusing on

1361
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,760
the wrong part of the story CU he's

1362
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,079
talking about how he's committing

1363
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,319
suicide and I just remember listening

1364
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,119
back to that

1365
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:39,720
one and it may have been the first time

1366
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,880
I tried sort of doing that and because

1367
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,520
he's so skilled I felt like it was

1368
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,960
something I could do and I I remember

1369
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,920
that being a big moment in the in the

1370
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:53,640
podcast for me of oh this there's some

1371
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:57,039
intangible magic that happens when you

1372
00:55:53,640 --> 00:56:00,599
go off script A little yeah um

1373
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:05,520
so rounding back to answer your question

1374
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:09,760
now I would say 0% of it is is planned

1375
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:13,280
yeah um the usually what will happen is

1376
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,319
say Bobby moam the other week came in we

1377
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,839
didn't talk beforehand he just said hey

1378
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:18,960
I'm going to do your show at this time I

1379
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:21,280
said great I'll see you there he shows

1380
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,520
up we all sit down I say so what do you

1381
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,720
want to do he says I think I'm going to

1382
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:29,720
be an orphan I said great let's start

1383
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:33,480
and we press record holy crap and

1384
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:36,240
everything that you hear on that is all

1385
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,160
improv Jesus all us not knowing where

1386
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,240
it's going to go he didn't plan anything

1387
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,319
I I think the most he I I don't want to

1388
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,680
speak for him but probably the most he

1389
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:48,119
planned out is that he was looking for a

1390
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,280
father or something I don't even think

1391
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:51,480
he knew his name I think that's

1392
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,079
sometimes you forget to even come up

1393
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,039
with a name when you're doing that so to

1394
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:58,000
when I was like so what's your name and

1395
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:00,119
he said uh orille it's like fival but

1396
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,920
one less like that's not planned that's

1397
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:05,160
him just being

1398
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,119
hilarious um so so none of that is

1399
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,280
planned the most I think we'll ever do

1400
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,319
is every once in a while a person will

1401
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,200
come on and have a vague idea of some

1402
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:16,160
beats that they want to hit mhm um and

1403
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,520
I'll try to remember to hit those you

1404
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,039
know but but a lot of times we don't

1405
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,880
even get to them yeah so um it's a

1406
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:26,799
little more planned on the TV show I

1407
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,640
would say um because we're in a so under

1408
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:32,720
so much of a time constraint 3 minutes

1409
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:36,200
basically for each character that we

1410
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,920
have to have a vague idea of where it's

1411
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,119
going but even even on that I was just

1412
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,920
watching the sixth episode today and

1413
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,920
James domian is on that one doing hu

1414
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,680
Hower and we had no plan on that like

1415
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:50,000
I've worked with James a lot I know hu's

1416
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:54,640
game I know where to lead him but we had

1417
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,280
no end to it we had no beats for it we

1418
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,160
didn't have time to do it I remember I

1419
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,240
was working constantly and James just

1420
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,240
showed up and we're were like okay what

1421
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,319
are we doing [ __ ] panic in our eyes and

1422
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,960
then we did it and it it ended it ends

1423
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,599
up really funny we came up with a really

1424
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,599
funny outbeat to it but all the all that

1425
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:12,319
stuff that you hear of like hu Houser

1426
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:13,720
turning into a Crobot on the on the

1427
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,720
program and stuff like that none of that

1428
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,680
is planned and that's the that's the

1429
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,280
reason that I continue to do the show I

1430
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,319
think is because the sheer joy and

1431
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,440
finding stuff like that just can't be

1432
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:26,880
matched I think you must have known many

1433
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,680
great men in your time many any great I

1434
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,200

1449
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,680
about him is that all you care to say

00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,319
about him yeah nice fell used to come in

1451
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,400
the store once in a while Michael Ang

1452
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:08,039

1454
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:12,559

00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:13,720
a CU did you think of taking has never

1456
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,839
had money well didn't you think of

1457
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,559
taking a piece of his art it would be

1458
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:19,000
worth I thought it stunk who knew why

1459
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:20,160
did you think I would gladly taken it

1460
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,760
why did you think that of course there

1461
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,640
all people flying around you know it

1462
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,760
wasn't like a nice picture of somebody

1463
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,480
on a

1464
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,039
pony wasn't nice they were naked too yes

your living room they do now now well

1467
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,760
now they're modern and

1468
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,400
diry then we were clean and cute I think

1469
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,359
I've honestly asked you every question

1470
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,559
we normally ask people you normally well

1471
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,839
let's get to the abnormal questions the

1472
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:50,680
strength on kinky what are you

1473
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:52,760
into what ah God I just wonder I have

1474
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,200
asked Mel Brooks to come on the podcast

1475
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,400
and no it's not going to happen I have

1476
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,799
asked is there any like dream guest like

1477
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,119
for you on your show either as a

1478
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:06,079
improviser or actual guest

1479
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:09,640
well um pee Herman was a or Paul rubben

1480
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:12,559
was was a huge one for me yeah um that's

1481
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,799
another big influence on me when I was

1482
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:19,319
again 15 is when that movie came out

1483
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:22,599
peew big adventure and um he's a giant

1484
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:25,599
influence on me so and I I chased him

1485
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:26,720
forever it took two years for me to get

1486
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,960
him on the

1487
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,680
of me bugging his publicity rep mhm and

1488
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,680
finally it all came together so that

1489
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,960
that I think is the most nervous I've

1490
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,839
ever sounded on the show like I think

1491
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,359
you can audibly hear

1492
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:44,720
me um my my voice shaking at certain

1493
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:46,920
times you know and it doesn't help that

1494
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,440
it's in front of a live audience you

1495
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,760
know as well which are you know I I

1496
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,960
enjoy doing the shows in front of live

1497
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,599
audiences but I'm certainly more

1498
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:57,319
comfortable in the studio so so that one

1499
01:00:54,599 --> 01:01:00,680
I was very nervous for um we tried to

1500
01:00:57,319 --> 01:01:02,880
get David Letterman on Between Two Ferns

1501
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:06,559
the special we just did that didn't end

1502
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,920
up working out um but he's a giant to me

1503
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,319
that I'll I'm sure I will never get to

1504
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,920
talk to I actually just went to a show

1505
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:14,680
for the first time a few weeks ago

1506
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,799
really um for as giant um of an

1507
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,280
influence he is on me I never I always

1508
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,480
wanted to go to a show and I never made

1509
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,839
it out until a few weeks ago oh [ __ ]

1510
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:27,039
this is 30 years for him isn't it yeah

1511
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:30,720
holy crap yeah damn so that's that would

1512
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:32,880
be huge for me I remember um I remember

1513
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,880
I always wanted to get certain people on

1514
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,280
the the live show the live standup show

1515
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,280
and I was like I was obsessed with

1516
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,599
getting Rodney janger field at one point

1517
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,160
and then the minute it pops in my head I

1518
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,559
like started to try to explore how to H

1519
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:49,240
have it happen and then he passed away

1520
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:52,960
right away um you know I I Seinfeld was

1521
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:54,920
a big influence on me before his TV show

1522
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,720
like I was really into his comedy for a

1523
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,799
long time um so you know people like

1524
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,640
that I mean you know I I just I have so

1525
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:05,680
much respect for comedy and I grew up a

1526
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,680
huge comedy nerd and so you know Bill

1527
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,039
Murray would be huge you know I'm I'm

1528
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,760
basically throwing out names of people I

1529
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,520
will never get to talk to it's okay it's

1530
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,839
okay I like knowing who people's

1531
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,000
influences are cuz there there are

1532
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,599
people who haven't heard of a lot of

1533
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,359
people that I love you know and it

1534
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,760
weirds me out uh I'm trying to think who

1535
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:22,520
I mentioned last time to one of my I

1536
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,760
would mention somebody like uh I've

1537
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:27,039
mentioned Frank Goron to an impression

1538
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,640
Amy Phillips was on

1539
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,039
I first heard her on your podcast

1540
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,359
because of her [ __ ] amazing lies of

1541
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:34,680
Manelli and I brought up Frank gor and

1542
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:36,000
she had she didn't know know you know I

1543
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,839
was surpris it's always interesting when

1544
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,799
you see something like that it it like

1545
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,599
because I knew Frank gon as the Riddler

1546
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:45,160
yeah growing up and that's all I knew

1547
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,000
and so to see and you always just assume

1548
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,960
oh he was an actor who grew to fame as

1549
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,319
the Riddler then you see him do his

1550
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:55,839
Impressions on um I probably saw him on

1551
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:58,400
uhic no not Ed Sullivan and it's like

1552
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,559
hits you like oh that's why he's the

1553
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,279
Riddler it's like Jim Carrey is the

1554
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,559
Riddler because he had this thing going

1555
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,960
on yeah his Impressions were really

1556
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,319
amazing Amy Phillips for not knowing who

1557
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,200
Frank Goran was you know there's plenty

1558
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,680
of people I didn't know Ernie Kovac

1559
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,920
before I started this podcast to be fair

1560
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:19,079
yeah I I watched a bunch of him when I

1561
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:22,160
was probably 20 never could get into it

1562
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:24,279
for some reason yeah even though I would

1563
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,760
thinking back some stuff we do on the

1564
01:03:24,279 --> 01:03:30,520
show is probably very kind of Ernie Kish

1565
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,520
yeah some stuff we do on the TV show um

1566
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,760
but for some reason I I never could get

1567
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:37,079
into it it's hard because it's

1568
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,960
experimental comedy so it that's that's

1569
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:42,480
it's almost like you have to be there

1570
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,680
sometimes too to go oh that's what he's

1571
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,079
reacting to yeah and realizing that it's

1572
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,240
the first time anybody was doing any of

1573
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,200
this stuff nobody was playing with

1574
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,400
chromy at the time yeah but there's a

1575
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,760
lot of stuff like that like the movie

1576
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,960
Jaws where I didn't see that until I was

1577
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,400
maybe 27 years old or something and I

1578
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,079
just assumed

1579
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,400
it's going to be like Ernie KX for me

1580
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:03,480
where I'm going to watch it and I'll

1581
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,559
have seen the parodies of it and the

1582
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,039
movies that are influenced by it so much

1583
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:09,960
that it won't have any effect on me but

1584
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,000
like Jaws is still great and I was like

1585
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,359
oh this is amazing yeah like you always

1586
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,920
want something to

1587
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:18,760
transcend that sort of thing where it

1588
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,880
and really hit you where where it can

1589
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,160
another huge influence on me was Bob

1590
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,839
Hope yeah I live on Bob Hope Street

1591
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:31,760
actually which was a giant thrill for me

1592
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:34,880
his neighborhood but um he was probably

1593
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,559
growing up the guy that I was really

1594
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,760
influenced by and

1595
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:44,599
actually when we when BJ and I started

1596
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:48,599
doing our Duo act it was a combination

1597
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:52,279
of Bob and Bing MH uh and Martin and

1598
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:54,640
Lewis those were the two old school uh

1599
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:58,880
uh touchstones that we had so it was a

1600
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:02,079
cross between those two things wow and

1601
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:04,200
Kaufman cross Odin Kirk that's awesome

1602
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:07,279
um so it was us trying to to put both of

1603
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,880
those things together but but we even I

1604
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:12,200
remember um we had one routine where we

1605
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,839
were um where I talked about how my

1606
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,480
grandfather was an Entertainer during

1607
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:17,760
World War II but he was for the other

1608
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,279
side and so we both

1609
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,839
reenacted he was in a Duo act as well

1610
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:26,240
and so we reenacted this Nazi um

1611
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:30,680
Vaudeville act oh God and uh we sang a

1612
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:32,160
song um that uh BJ wrote and and Evan

1613
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:36,000
schl wrote the music

1614
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:38,520
to and like we straight up ripped off

1615
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,319
something in road to Utopia I think it

1616
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,000
is or road to Rio one of those movies

1617
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:44,440
but I think I think it's road to Rio I

1618
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,200
think they uh uh hope and Crosby start

1619
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,000
with a dance routine and we just

1620
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,400
straight up like we were like in the

1621
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,960
middle of the routine I have a little

1622
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,000
musical theater background I was doing a

1623
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,319
little tap and stuff and we were like

1624
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,240
okay we need to do something here what

1625
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:59,920
do we do and so we watched RoR Rio and

1626
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:03,240
they do this hilarious bit where

1627
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:06,039
um where Bing puts his hands down like

1628
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:08,680
he's going to give Bob Hope a lift and

1629
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:10,400
have him do a flip uh and Bob puts his

1630
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,359
foot on it and then they jump up in the

1631
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,079
air about one foot off the ground to go

1632
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:17,160
hey awesome and it's really really funny

1633
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:18,799
we're like let's just try that and you

1634
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,640
know we did it and just straight up

1635
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,920
ripped it off but at the same time you

1636
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,440
know they were ripping it off from

1637
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,640
someone's shoe so you know of course but

1638
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,440

1639
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,599

Itali lovely Italian couple taking care

01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,920
of them for us do you see them often do

1659
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:13,559
you visit them oh yes of a Sunday of a

1660
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,720
Tuesday of one of those days I I might

1661
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,160
just Moi over to Hartford and high a

1662
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,760
gang you know and then speed right back

1663
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:23,880
to Connecticut Connecticut you mosy over

1664
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,079
in speed back yes if you were to this is

1665
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,599
the final question the one I'd forgotten

1666
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,000
uh if you were to recommend this album

1667
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,599
to people which I assume you are since

1668
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,039
you did oh yeah why for somebody who's

1669
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,760
never maybe even listened to Mel Brooks

1670
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,920
or never obviously never heard the album

1671
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:39,520
what's what's the reason you would say I

1672
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:42,000
mean if if you want to hear a comedian

1673
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,279
just at the height of his intelligence

1674
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,279
coming up with

1675
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:49,160
stuff so quickly that you wouldn't

1676
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:51,359
believe it

1677
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,119
um you should definitely listen to this

1678
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:56,440
I mean and the other part of it is

1679
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:59,000
unlike a lot of standup records a lot of

1680
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,039
sketch records it is improv I mean it's

1681
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,279
the most it's the thing that's most akin

1682
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:06,279
to certainly my podcast but a lot of

1683
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:08,240
podcast out there where it's just people

1684
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:11,480
riffing and thinking of stuff really

1685
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,039
really quickly and the reason I picked

1686
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,640
the third one out of all of them and I

1687
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,880
would just say listen excuse me listen

1688
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,440
to all of them but the reason I picked

1689
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:20,400
the third one is I think it has the

1690
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:23,400
highest ratio of bits that really really

1691
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:26,440
work and and for me the most classic

1692
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,719
lines in it I think the

1693
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,799
the line where Mel Brooks describes the

1694
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,080
difference between tragedy and comedy I

1695
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:35,880
didn't know that came from this album

1696
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:38,199
until that's crazy it's so great and it

1697
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:41,040
sounds that actually sounds like it may

1698
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:44,400
have been something he'd said before but

1699
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,960
the fact that he pulls it yeah really

1700
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:49,960
quickly mhm um and all based on a

1701
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,279
suggestion from Carl Riner I mean it's

1702
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,120
not like they had planned that out of

1703
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,239
like oh let's go into the comedy tragedy

1704
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,520
bit it really was just like

1705
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:00,480
like and and maybe it was maybe it was

1706
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:02,239
Carl Riner knowing that he that Mel

1707
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:04,359
Brooks had this in reserve or something

1708
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,920
and like setting him up and just teeing

1709
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:08,000
him up so that Mel Brooks can knock it

1710
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,199
out of the park but but this record has

1711
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,359
the most the the highest ratio I think

1712
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:16,080
of just bits that really really work as

1713
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:18,560
well as it has the best non 2,000-year

1714
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,239
Old Man characters that um Mel Brooks

1715
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,679
does I think the

1716
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:26,279
um I think actually the the second

1717
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,799
record the 2001 year I love the third

1718
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:29,960
best poet that's really akin to

1719
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:33,799
something that we do on Comedy Bang Bang

1720
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:36,239
but um I love Dr Felix weird is great it

1721
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:37,880
really is like the by the the first

1722
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:40,400
record Mel Brooks is trying a lot of

1723
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,920
different types of characters and not

1724
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,880
all of them work the I I know the um

1725
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:50,359
Fabiola is like a minute and a half and

1726
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:53,239
it's him doing a um basically an

1727
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:56,360
impression of a 60s Coffee House singer

1728
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:58,400
and all the only joke to it is he's like

1729
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,520
hey that's it you know there's there's

1730
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,400
no joke to it but by the third record he

1731
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,360
figured out what works I think for him

1732
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:07,480
and so all there's four tracks on it and

1733
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,760
on all four of them he's playing

1734
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,120
variations of of the 2,000-year old man

1735
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,640
just with different voices so I think

1736
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:16,560
it's the best one out of all of them

1737
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,600
just for that reason and so I mean to to

1738
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,719
me it's

1739
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:23,400
just they're some of the best best

1740
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:26,239
records of all time just because there's

1741
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,920
stuff on them that you would never hear

1742
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:29,120
anywhere else and it's all just because

1743
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,480
they happen to have a tape recorder

1744
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:34,199
running and they are incredibly quick

1745
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:37,159
yeah thank you so much for coming here
