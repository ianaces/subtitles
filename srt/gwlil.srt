environment because how can we look into

125
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,720
the eyes of our

126
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,840
children and tell them that we have

127
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,840

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,520
vegetables the seasons will become

133
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,960
harsher and harsher and

134
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,440

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:22,870

divorce it's cool man it's cool having a

195
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,120
divorce you get to have single sex

196
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,839
again which is weird cuz when you're

197
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,519
married you look at every other female

198
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,360
on the planet you're

199
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,519
like I could [ __ ] her

200
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,240
too and then you get a divorce and

201
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,720
you're allowed to and it's

202
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,160
like

203
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,680
oh well that wasn't as much fun as I

204
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,240
thought it was going to be like

205
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,839
sometimes it's cool but most of the time

206
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,760
you're too drunk you don't know the

207
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,800
woman well enough it's just real robotic

208
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,200
like you don't feel like you're making

209
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,079
love to somebody you feel like you're

210
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,639
two vacuum cleaners falling down the

211
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,639
stairs

212
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,440
together like afterwards you only feel

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,920
like a kiss would be appropriate just a

214
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,920
firm

215
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,720
handshake you played a hell of a game

216
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,440
man sometimes it's cool though like I

217
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,800
was in my flat and a young lady who I'd

218
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,279
been seeing

219
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,330
but not

220
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,399
dating if you catch

221
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,560
[Music]

222
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,519
my called up and it was late at night so

223
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:49,600
I was drunk because that's the

224
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,600
rule can you see the son no get a

225
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,079
beer sometimes I have to go into the

226
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,079
basement to implement that rule

227
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,480
man late at night she's also very drunk

228
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,120
so really that call can only be about

229
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,000
one thing because in general girls don't

230
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,000
like to play

231
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:22,760

behavior

263
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,399
no it's wrong I mean maybe she's worried

264
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,959
about what we're doing isn't

265
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,839
romantic that could be something two

00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:00,199
drunks bumping uglies in the

267
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,600
night it's not that romantic is it maybe

268
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:07,600

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:10,959
swans mate for life have you heard that

as you let them

272
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,519
go with a look on their face that you

273
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:27,199
suggest they are not coming

274
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,639
back two feet is a lot of neck to shake

275
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,639
no width

276
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,079
I have the physical ability to turn

277
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,959
around and look at what's happening but

278
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,959
I don't want

279
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,040
to never take bread from a man with a

280
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,810
mustache just makes you

281
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,810
[Laughter]

282
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,519
sleepy here's the thing too man I am

283
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,880
romantic she just doesn't know it though

284
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,720
you know cuz I said I've been seeing uh

285
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,680
this girl but not dating her that wasn't

286
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,880
necessarily true I um I had been dating

287
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,680
her for a while but then uh I realized

288
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,279
that it wasn't going to work and that it

289
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,880
was cruel to keep her going on like that

290
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,360
and I did one of the most romantic

291
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,720
things I've ever done with a girl I

292
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,399
called her up and went to her house and

293
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,959
I broke up with

294
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,759
her as opposed to using the

295
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,720
system which is you just act like a dick

296
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,839
for a year and wait for her to break up

297
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,560
with you yeah don't look at the guys now

298
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,560
you do not mention the

299
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,160
system the system has worked very well

300
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,920
for

301
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,399
us we've got to ruin Christmas and try

302
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,240
to [ __ ] their sisters I

303
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,260
know never mention the system in front

304
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,839
of the ovary havs

305
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:03,160
[Laughter]

306
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:07,519
still do explain where she is

307
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,120
though out there somewhere in the night

308
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,199
I mean maybe she's just become

309
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,639
disillusioned with everything after the

310
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:17,240
call and then some little spark in her

311
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,519
brain just overloaded because

312
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,600
technologically we are living in a

313
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,120
fastpaced world do you realize we're the

314
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,860

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,319
mentally

319
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,800

to disparage our country's fine name but

461
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,919
um I I actually I like Canadians but I

462
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,720
hate doing shows for

463
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,240
them [ __ ] horrible sometimes you like

464
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,240
not all the time some of the shows are

465
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,200
good but sometimes they just stare at

466
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,679
your jokes as if they were the ramblings

467
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,640
of a man who'd flouted the bicycle

468
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,640
helmet laws and paid a very dear price

469
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,400
indeed like it just hurts their ears

470
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,240
sometimes like I had one dude come up to

471
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,400
me after the show and he's like younger

472
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,159
than me he's like

473
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,159
so how's it feel know you just offended

474
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,159
a room full of Christians I was

475
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
like honestly

476
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,960
good now you know how I feel when you

477
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,480
talk but what bothered me I was just

478
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,159
being flipping there what bothered me

479
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,360
about what that dude said is that as a

480
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,880
comedian I don't want to offend a room

481
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,039
full of

482
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,480
anybody but he was like

483
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,960
Christians I

484
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,360
was

485
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,360
what not just humans

486
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,240
Christians well they've never done

487
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:41,039
anything wrong have

488
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,039
they how dare

489
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,840
I cuz usually I won't I won't get in an

490
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,600
argument with people after a show you

491
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,240
either like the show or you don't I

492
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,679
honestly in my heart of hearts don't

493
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,440
give a [ __ ] if you don't like

494
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,279
it but I I got I got into it with him I

495
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,240
was like so whates you think you's got

496
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,399
some sort of inalienable right to never

497
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,480
hear anything you disagree with on a

498
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:09,000
standup comedy stage and he went because

499
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,360
Christians built Canada I said no they

500
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,640
didn't Chinese slaves

501
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,880
did and I know you probably don't know

502
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,760
what I'm talking about cuz as a country

503
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,279
and as a Canadian we very rarely ever

504
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,600
talk about it you may have seen all the

505
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,760
commercials come to Canada we've got

506
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,159
everything we got ice hockey we got the

507
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,440
mountains we got the oceans yeah where

508
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,440
did the railroad come from I don't

509
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,120
know it was just

510
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,840
there I think the Indians built

511
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,840
it with help from the

512
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,640
Beavers yeah man but that's the thing

513
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,559
that's the thing about religious offense

514
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,320
and now that I mean that's what bu them

515
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,039
the most too cuz I wasn't just standing

516
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,960
up saying God's knob no I was like

517
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,480
pointing out [ __ ] from their book and

518
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,559
that bugs them way more than just going

519
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,960
God's a [ __ ] because if you actually

520
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,799
point out stuff from the book that's

521
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,880
when they get their hackles up like you

522
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,600
may not quote that only we may and the

523
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,760
meanings of those change when we need

524
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
them

525
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,279
to but that's the thing about religious

526
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,520
offenses it only ever takes place

527
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,039
outside of the religion people who don't

528
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,000
believe in it say something that's when

529
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,520
they get their big hackles up going you

530
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,640
may not say that you are

531
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,720
wrong you know like how come it never

532
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,760
takes place inside the religion like

533
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,559
every time a Christian sporting athlete

534
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,279
wins something he'll generally thank

535
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,279
Jesus Christ and the Christians in the

536
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:52,279
crowd will generally cheer along going

537
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,919
yeah Jesus big win big

538
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:59,760
guy how come nobody ever stands up and

539
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:01,559
goes that's not how it works

540
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,200
like if Jesus Christ helped you in a

541
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,200
football match you should keep that

542
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,559
secret that's

543
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,360
cheating God helped

544
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,120
you if Jesus Christ helped you in a

545
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,760
football match that should be a secret

546
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,790
between you Jesus and the gangsters he

547
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,159
owed money

548
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:28,600
[Laughter]

549
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:31,240
to and Muslims do it too man uh all

550
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Muslims but there's a certain section of

551
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,480
Islamic Society who's very sensitive to

552
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:42,039
anything a non-believer does be it

553
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,279
misname a teddy bear or use recycled

554
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:46,440
paper because it may contain old

555
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:48,120
editions of the Quran anytime that

556
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,399
happens it's

557
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,399
all I'm

558
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,360
paraphrasing but if we know that they're

559
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,919
that

560
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,880
sensitive over any little thing well

561
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,360
then tell me this how come no muslim in

562
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:13,399
the history of time has ever gotten

563
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,399
upset at the dude who named the city

564
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:21,039
Islamabad that's mere punctuation away

565
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,039
from

566
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:29,120
sacrilege how come they never shake the

567
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,120
swords over the sky at that one

568
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,880
is the question I pose to

569
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:39,320
you man I'll fix them all you give me

570
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,360
half a chance I'll fix all the religions

571
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,919
you know we help you join the next

572
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,039
Millennia like uh no more naming your

573
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,799
kids after Messiah that's done you can't

574
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,600
do that anymore and that's not just

575
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,320
Muslims Christians do it too but they do

576
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,640
it in Spain and they say it wrong so

577
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,640
that we didn't know what they were up

578
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,840
to remember the first time you sus that

579
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,480
Jesus

580
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,960
[ __ ] I didn't know that was Jesus I

581
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,840
thought it was a catchphrase for an

582
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,919
ancient Grecian

583
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,120
[Laughter]

584
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,120
sitcom hey

585
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,080
[Applause]

586
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,440
Zeus yeah man no maner kids after

587
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,600
Messiah especially those two groups of

588
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,519
people Spanish people and Muslims that's

589
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,960
a social ticking Time Bomb because those

590
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,559
are two groups of people who are very

591
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,559
good at

592
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,640
boxing how close are we to see in the

593
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,640
poster 12 rounds live from Las Vegas for

594
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:51,559
the welterweight championship of the

595
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,559
world Jesus versus

596
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,320
Mohamed I dare say that would be one of

597
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:59,080
the most contentious fights of our

598
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,000
lifetime

599
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,880
people from both sides of that coin

600
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,360
would show up oh mean Sama Bin Laden

601
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,960
would be there he'd have to come dress

602
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,159
like Batman and act like he was at a

603
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,159
stag do but he'd be

604
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,200
there the pope he'd come he'd have to

605
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:21,000
come in a big plastic ball like a

606
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,030
hamster but he would show

607
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,550
face chasing his hat around

608
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,550
[Laughter]

609
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,279
yeah

610
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:40,080
man no more naming your kids after

611
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,240
messiah's it's done and just on a

612
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,840
practical level like if you give birth

613
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,120
to what you honestly think is a little

614
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,360
Messiah why you let him be his own

615
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,880
Messiah why you got to hang him on the

616
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,600
hook with the behavior of all the

617
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,440
Messiahs that came before him cuz here's

618
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,559
the thing only reason we know about

619
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,279
those other size is cuz they were

620
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:05,480
[ __ ] attention seeking name

621
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,440
droppers when they came down they're

622
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,919
like oh yeah hey Son of God right here

628
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,279
Messiah come along only thing he wants

633
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,960

Ricky would listen to all these

686
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:14,359
questions sort of take them

687
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,520
in

688
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:19,879
turn to the inquisitive

689
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,480
crowd with his only

690
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:26,079
answer for every question they'

691
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,119
shouted with fear in their

692
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:33,679
eyes needing to know the

693
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,679
answer and his only reply would

694
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,960
be that's all it could say

695
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,919
man because he actually was the son of

696
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,640
God and he

697
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:59,839
knew not say

698
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:03,920
anything because no matter what he

699
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,920
said anyone would just wait for him to

700
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,960
die and then use it to do whatever the

701
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,200
[ __ ] they wanted to do in the first

702
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,000
place so

703
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:19,160
really if someone says they're a Son of

704
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,160
God it's pretty good proof that they're

705
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,760
not

706
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,640

racist

but and it's a little trick racists like

736
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,720
to do when they want to say something

737
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,040
racist but they know how inappropriate

738
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,280
that'll be so they say say they're not

739
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,880
going to say something racist then they

740
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,000

Jews I said the Jews aren't a race

00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:10,520
black no one has ever changed their race

770
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,520
well one guy did but he's dead

771
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:20,960
now and while I'm on the

772
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:30,760
subject why did the authorities wait

773
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,760
till after his death to investigate his

774
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,680
doctors surely when his nose fell

775
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,640
off he call him in for a bit of

776
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,960
questioning like what the [ __ ] did you

777
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,240
do to

778
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,520
him I'm not [ __ ] you man it's what

779
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,520
he

780
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,720
wanted but you know what they

781
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,119
investigated him

782
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,440
over sleeping

783
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:04,119
pills prescribing him sleeping pills is

784
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,760
the least weird thing a doctor's ever

785
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,599
done to him like honestly if you were

786
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,599
his doctor regardless of how you feel

787
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,800
about this situation if you were his

788
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,599
doctor and he came into your office and

789
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,040
went hey look doc here's the Big Skinny

790
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:22,200
on my life my face is falling

791
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,440
off and everyone on the planet thinks

792
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,839
that I'm a

793
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,520
pedophile subsequently I'm having a

794
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:30,520
little trouble getting to sleep at

795
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,760
night hot Coco's not turning out the

796
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,480
lights I mean certainly investigate it

797
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,440
investigate it and if there is some odd

798
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,160
strain of sleeping pill that's killing

799
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,000
musical genius isolate it and give one

800
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,640
to Iggy Pop and Johnny Rotten and be

801
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,119
done with

802
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,960
it exactly they are done they are

803
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,160
finished they are not allowed to say

804
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,920
anything anymore because I don't live in

805
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,400
the UK all the time I come in I come out

806
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,000
and you could imagine my chagrin when

807
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,640
the last time my plane landed I turned

808
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,760
my television on to find out that punk

809
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,839
music had been invented to sell

810
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,839
insurance and

811
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,920
butter that's [ __ ] man and I'm not

812
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,319
one of these people who says people

813
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,359
can't advertise or sponsor things that's

814
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,839
wrong people can't I don't have anything

815
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,640
against advertising my ex-wife Works in

816
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,480
advertising and she's a wonderful

817
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,880
fabulous woman she hates my guts which

818
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,760
is further proof of a good head on her

819
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,240
shoulders but I'm not one of these

820
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,040
people that says you can't advertise

821
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,440
anything you can but I'm sorry I don't

822
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,440
know how much Iggy Pop thinks he knows

823
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,079
about

824
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,319
insurance was he constantly taking calls

825
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,040
like Iggy I got another plan on my mind

826
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,079
no no wait wait let no let let me go

827
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,079
through my

828
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:58,520
books you can't there's nothing in rock

829
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,079
and roll that would qualify you for

830
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,760
insurance the only thing in rock and

831
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,720
roll that's close to insurance is

832
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,720
calling two dealers on the same

833
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,160
[Laughter]

834
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,520
night butter

835
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,640

you [ __ ] you it's a solid

841
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,839
joke that's the worst one that's the

842
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,680
worst one just I remember the first time

843
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,680
I saw the ad I was like they shouldn't

844
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,800
be allowed to use a Johnny Rotten look

845
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,520
Al like oh my

846
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,040
God but it's not Johnny Rod's not the

847
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,480
only one who's done it aie Osborne's

848
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,960
done a butter commercial also which is

849
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,920
what what is it about rock and roll

850
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,440
genius who get to the age of 50 and go

851
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,119
you know what I got to tell everyone

852
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,119
what to put on

853
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,880
toast the only people connected to rock

854
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,119
and roll who could possibly endorse

855
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,119
butter would be

856
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,640
groupes and only as a

857
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:20,000
lubricant that's that you should never

858
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,960
oo a root lubrication

859
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,680
joke

860
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,920
oh that one went in a little

861
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,839
rough back to the

862
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,680
taxi there with the driver again cab

863
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:37,760
driver I got him down 2 nil he's never

864
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,160
been in this position before in his life

865
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,680
it should be an easy game all you do is

866
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,680
say you're not going to say something

867
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,559
racist then you say something racist it

868
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,559
should be as easy as racist

869
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,480
pie so he just had to go quick he was

870
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,520
like

871
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,440
I'm not

872
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:07,319
racist

873
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,319
but a par is right and we should have

874
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,960
[Music]

875
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,200
it pretty racist

876
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,240
H does anyone here know of any reason

877
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:23,359
why that would not be a racist

878
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:26,030
comment well well allow me to fire up

879
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:31,060
the mind blowing machine

880
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,060
[Music]

881
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,079
I said you're not a raises because a

882
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,920
paride is a Dutch word that means

883
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,920
separate it does not connotate black or

884
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,920
white

885
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,440
furthermore when the slaves were freed

886
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,400
from North America after emancipation

887
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,040
there was a group that was given a small

888
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,839
plot of land in Africa called Liberia

889
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,240
which they went back to and and

890
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,359
implemented a paride on the people that

891
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,240
were living there before they got there

892
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,000
so when you say a paride you're not

893
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,359
really talking about a black and white

894
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,280
issue you're talking about an African

895
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,280
culture versus Western culture

896
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,119
issue I'm

897
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,760
right you may never have heard of it but

898
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,760
it's been Googled and

899
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,440
wikipedian but it was funny it was funny

900
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,960
that [ __ ] thing like once I said it

901
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,520
you guys all just sort

902
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,319
of cuz no I know it's cuz I'm talking

903
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:42,319
about racism on a stand-up comedy stage

904
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:45,040
and I'm white no I know I'm

905
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,520
white oh it makes uncom it makes some

906
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,160
people uncomfortable if you know if I

907
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,720
was black it'd be fine if I was black

908
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,440
and talked about racism on a standup

909
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,440
comedy stage you'd all clap along just

910
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,119
so I wouldn't think you were

911
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,680
racist but it's cool no it's it's cool

912
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,040
what you did because you should be

913
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,359
sensitive about the issue of racism but

914
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,760
perhaps not so sensitive that you stop

915
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,880
listening to someone's point of view

916
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
based on the color of their

917
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,400
[Music]

918
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,000
skin caught you in a little Guardian

919
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,000
trap

920
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,800
there but that's the thing about racism

921
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,160
people only ever notice other people's

922
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,520
racism they never notice their own you

923
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,760
know like uh

924
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,400
one thing that pisses me off really a

925
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,040
lot is um the footballs kick racism out

926
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,359
of football and that's basically the

927
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,680
teams and uh the players and the owners

928
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,520

934
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,119
now also like to tell you all how to

935
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:03,599
think which is not being racist which is

936
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:06,400
is what you are being right now so stop

937
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,119
it and here's the thing I know some

938
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,839
hardcore football

939
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,960
holigans who when they when they say

940
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:17,520
things like that they're like we're

941
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,559
not we're not

942
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,640
racist we don't care what flavor [ __ ]

943
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,240
scores the goal as long as he's wearing

944
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,520
our

945
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,520
shirt we're shirst

946
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,119
we don't like the other shirts but we're

947
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:37,440
not racist so really if football wants

948
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,640
to have a social program like that maybe

949
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,480
they should get a little more

950
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,480
introspective and kick rape out of

951
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,590
football be a lot easier just get the

952
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:52,599
players to stop doing

953
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:56,400

954
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,800

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,640
some of the programs that FIFA has like

956
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,920

957
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,960

958
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,480

1025
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:19,160
deafening all I can hear is the

1026
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:22,160
inappropriate house music from

1027
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,680
upstairs which I mean it's just a pub

1028
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,640

I'm actually not as poor as I appear to

1036
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:01,799
be no I could have afford to dress a lot

1037
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:04,480
better than I do but I don't for one

1038
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:07,359
very simple reason and that is that I

1039
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,680
[ __ ] hate rich

1040
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,400
people I can't stand them I think

1041
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,119
they're the biggest pack of [ __ ] who've

1042
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,720
ever walked this fine Earth of ours I

1043
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:17,300
don't want to be connected to them in

[Applause]

1046
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:27,559
way cuz here's the thing I know I'm

1047
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,839
scruffy I know that and when I meet

1048
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:31,760
somebody new I usually have to say five

1049
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,559
intelligent things in conversation

1050
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,240
before they treat me like I'm not

1051
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,240
mentally

1052
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,680
[ __ ] number six I get to take the

fork and I'm not saying that there's no

1055
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,839
reason to treat people like that I'm

1056
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,240
just saying that there's now been a sea

1057
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,640
change and the treatment of people like

1058
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,760
me have received since the dawn of time

1059
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,359

00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,280
around dressed like hippies making peace

1110
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,119
signs and be like yeah man let's see

1111
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,319
what

1112
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,839
happens but their children

1113
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,839
are their children dressed like gangster

1114
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:38,839
rappers for some reason which by the way

1115
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:42,400
there's nothing wrong with doing if you

1116
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:44,720
are indeed a gangster

1117
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,559
rapper but if you're some rich little

1118
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,920
punk you can't dress like a gangster

1119
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,440
rapper what are you trying to fool us

1120
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,960

1122
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:58,880
Mansion how odd

1123
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,559
but you know why rich kids dress like

1124
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,039
gangster rappers is because they want an

1125
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,440
air of criminality about themselves they

1126
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:05,880
want to be able to show up to the mall

1127
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,480
and have everyone go oh my God it's a

1128
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,680

00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,839
dream of I guarantee you a load of

1134
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,200
gangster rappers have never teamed up

1135
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:29,340
and stolen the mineral from a developing

1136
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:33,200
country that's never

1137
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:38,079

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,559
we start is by punishing the bankers

1192
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,200
it's yours to take back but that's when

1193
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:07,880

1199
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,280
indoctrinated from a young age I what

did they do they were dressed pretty

1201
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,559

1202
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,880
it I mean what did they actually do I'll

1203
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:30,000
tell you what they actually did they

1204
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,319
took your [ __ ]

1205
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,680
future they have it you think of your

1206
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:38,599
kids it's it's just bankers and and not

01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:40,599
for anything cool like it's no big like

1208
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:43,799
social movement that's going to make the

1209
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:45,880
world better it was just to fund their

1210
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:48,400
[ __ ] Lifestyles which if you ever

1211
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,400
knew one is just horrible it's all about

1212
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,640
a big boat and a wife that they dipped

1213
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,160
in plastic it's [ __ ] weird and that's

1214
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:58,520
where our [ __ ] future is with them

1215
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,880
[ __ ] that it's time to punish them and

1216
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,799
you can act like you don't have to

1217
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:05,319
punish them maybe they won't do it again

1218
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:08,599
no that's incorrect because historically

1219
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:11,440
Bankers are the only people that Jesus

1220
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:11,440
ever yelled

1221
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,160

01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,880
you

1361
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:32,319
[ __ ] and I'm sorry to make a gender

1362
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,040
specific because I know what could

1363
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:37,239
happen between a guy and a guy or a girl

1364
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:40,480
or a girl but I make it gender specific

1365
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:44,679
because it is gender specific because

1366
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:49,120
you and when I say you I mean

1367
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:50,000
women aren't as big as us so you can't

1368
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,839
punch

1369
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,759
us so you have to do tricky [ __ ] to get

1370
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:58,319
inside our heads

1371
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:01,319

excuse could possibly be for this

1391
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:54,520
indignation done to

1392
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:56,679

1393
01:09:54,520 --> 01:10:00,000
more angrier

1394
01:09:56,679 --> 01:10:00,000

1399
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:24,400
one but I was so

1400
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:27,679
intoxicated I accidentally sent my booty

um stuck with it regardless um and uh I

1412
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:11,719
think you'll probably get into about 70%

1413
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,719
of the DVD so

1414
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,560

to talk to you all I don't know where my

1416
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,320
life is taking me I I know where I'm

1417
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:23,960

01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,440
back in England at uh some point to say

1421
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:34,640
hello to all of you again thanks so much

1422
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,640
for coming

1423
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:51,640
[Music]

1424
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:51,640
[Applause]

1425
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:05,159
you I don't want to around this

1426
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:09,400
house I got I

1427
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:13,880
do you don't like the way I break the

1428
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,880
rules I got better

1429
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:39,560
yeah man we always got time for Kiki's

1430
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:42,080
favorite joke this is a little DVD extra

1431
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,890
that is that's the end of the show so

1432
01:12:42,080 --> 01:13:04,949
clap a little longer

1433
01:12:43,890 --> 01:13:04,949
[Applause]

1434
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:14,159
this last joke is uh more prophetic than

1435
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:17,320
you think it's about uh stopping

1436
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:21,120
drinking uh when you don't want

1437
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:23,440
to and only [ __ ] is that

1438
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,320
hard I don't know if anyone's here has

1439
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,280
ever tried to do that when you don't

1440
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,840
want it like when you want it it's but

1441
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:34,560
when you don't it's

1442
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:37,560
like because your body has a host of

1443
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,199
Tricks not just one like a bunch like

1444
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,440
hey I'm going to reach for that coca

1445
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:43,840
colola how' a beer get in my hands brain

1446
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,840
what I don't

1447
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:53,199
know you must have picked it

1448
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:55,760
up but uh I tried to stop drinking once

1449
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:59,840
and my brain uh used to have its

1450
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:04,120
favorite trick to play on me and um that

1451
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:07,080
would be uh I'd be sleeping in my own

1452
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:09,159
bed cuz I wasn't

1453
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:13,719
drinking as opposed to when you are

1454
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:16,199
drinking and it's in like a rose bed

1455
01:14:13,719 --> 01:14:20,800
or a truck

1456
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:20,800
bed some guy named Warren's

1457
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,840
bed I don't know who you are

1458
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:33,760
either if I could find my pants I would

1459
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,800
leave they're on your

1460
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:44,390
head I

1461
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:50,990
know I'm the party pharaoh

1462
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:50,990
[Laughter]

1463
01:14:56,679 --> 01:15:05,120
i' be asleep in my own

1464
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:06,800
bed and uh my brain would want boo so

1465
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,199
much he used to play this trick just to

1466
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:13,360
make it so FL I'd be having a

1467
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:15,560
