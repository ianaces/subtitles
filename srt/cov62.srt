like I wanted them to connect with him

118
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,639
on a deeper level and get to see all of

119
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:51,320
who he was and so in February of 2011 um

120
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,960
I was hanging out with Paul provenza now

121
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,320

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,039
prenza directing it then I know I'm not

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,360
going to make a total [ __ ] [ __ ] of

129
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:16,759
myself because for me he is like the

130
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,319
highest of Comedy tastes there is sure

131
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,840
and uh so he basically within a month

132
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,360
had me booked at Just for Laughs in

133
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,080
Montreal Wow Wow in July coming up so I

134
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,560
was like oh okay well I guess we're

135
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,160
doing this thing holy [ __ ] yeah so I

136
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,960
started just going down to the comedy

137
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,280
magic club in Hermosa Beach and using

138
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,560
their little side room the lounge MH

139
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
because Mike down there had always said

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,160
to me if you ever want to workout

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
material or anything come down use the

142
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,280
lounge and I just once a week got up on

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,720
stage and just started recording and

144
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,400
telling stories and writing and writing

145
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,360
on my feet and I'm really a writer

146
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,000
writer first of all and so right one

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
night I just decided to write on my feet

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,479
and just see what would come out and

149
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,039
like 2 and a half hours later I was

150
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,520
like okay I do not work that well I do

151
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,400
not work that way I'm clearly my

152
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,800
father's daughter in that way I have to

153
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,560
have it down and then organized yeah and

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,440
then by the time I got to July um in

155
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,680
Montreal I had it in decent shape but I

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,800
didn't have it fully memorized okay I

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,400
hadn't had really actualized it so I had

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,039
2third of it on music stands on stage

159
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,440
right stage left which I would kind of

160
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,520
go back and forth and then in the middle

161
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,000
I would come and do scenarios and scenes

162
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,400
and do the acting part of things and

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,160
then go back to the narrating or

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,160
whatever and um and then after we did

165
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,160
that prens and I got together in the

166
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,599
fall of 2011 and that's when we really

167
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,880
developed it we carved it shaped it had

168
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,880
5 hour sessions where you know it was

169
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,840
like therapy and he would smoke a lot of

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,759
pot and I would cry a lot oh my gosh oh

171
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,039
my God and I I would just you know and

172
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,080
tell him stories that had nothing to do

173
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,840
with anything that would ever be on

174
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,879
stage but he was like Gathering it all

175
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,720
in and he was kind of the synthesizer of

176
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,919
it all Co okay and so by November of

177
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,720
2011 it was it was basically in the

178
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,080
shape it's in now and really the last

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,240
year and a half has been me getting

180
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,280
stage time I mean I had I'm not a

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,400
standup I've been doing storytelling

182
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,400
around La for 10 years which means 10

183
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,919
minutes of stage time every other month

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,199
right right pretty much that was it yeah

185
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,919
so I've been getting this kind of I've

186
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,400
been getting this amazing education

187
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,240
about being on stage so that's like my

188
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,319
personal fun with it now is the script

189
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,120
is pretty much set yeah and now I'm

190
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,879
learning how to actually live breathe

191
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,960
and eatting [ __ ] on stage right right

192
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,120
right you know I think typically if you

193
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,919
hear if you hear about somebody who's

194
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,800
maybe trying to tell the sort of story

195
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,039
you're you're doing they might do a lot

196
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,280
of research but it sounds more like

197
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,280
you're just you're telling the stories

198
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,159
you already know that must be what

199
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,560
people are connecting with completely it

200
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,720
is the Carlin family stories and and and

201
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,960
it starts off really the first half and

202
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,120
it's a it's two acts it's a 90-minute

203
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,280
show with an intermission and the First

204
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,039
Act is really kind of me up to age 12 so

205
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,159
it really is the family and it's my

206
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,360
shaping years and what my dad

207
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,479
experienced and and a good portion of

208
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,479
that is the stories that everyone wants

209
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,319
to kind of witness and feel and hear

210
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,560
about our family during those times it

211
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,760
was the straight 60s

212
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,399
the crazy 70s basically and um and then

213
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,800
the second half of the show is is I'm

214
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,599
always playing videos of his and his

215
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,399
videos are kind of bouncing off our life

216
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,320
together or my life at the time so

217
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,320
sometimes they're direct

218
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
chronological you know kind of comment

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,920
about what's going on interesting and

220
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,480
sometimes it's more of a

221
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,560
thematic thing coming in you know either

222
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,839
in contrast and conflict with what I'm

223
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,560
trying to deal with at the of my life

224
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,800
with or it's supporting it in some way

225
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,680
so we kind of play with the video in all

226
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,760
different ways that's incredibly cool

227
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,240
yeah it's fun that's uh did you uh if

228
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,480
you don't mind I I wanted to talk to you

229
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,360
but we always talk about people about

230
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,720
their first comedy influences but you

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,440
grow up in a comedy house I mean I think

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,120
that that that that question is answered

233
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,680
immediately perhaps but yeah it well it

234
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,720
it pretty much is I mean in some ways

235
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,200
mhm um I mean the very first time I saw

236
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,560
my dad on TV I was a somewhere between 2

237
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,640
or 3 years old and my mom was very

238
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,800
excited Daddy was on TV and she got me

239
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,440
all situated in front of the television

240
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,240
set now of course this is 1966 most

241
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,880
likely so your TV was a piece of

242
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,640
furniture in your enormous count console

243
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,959
thing as you all remember I don't know

244
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,839
if you do you're a little young but um

245
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,560
uh and I guess

246
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,480
uh I have no memory of this but I guess

247
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,720
what happened was Dad came on you know

248
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,000
introducing George Carlin and my dad

249
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,680
came out on stage I don't know if it was

250
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,680
at Sullivan or what it was and I

251
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,480
proceeded to scream and cry where's my

252
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,240
daddy where's my daddy and run out of

253
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
the room

254
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,480
no yeah I can imagine that' be traumatic

255
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,839
because yeah suddenly my dad was about

256
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,839
you know 4 in tall and stuck inside of a

257
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,600
box oh my God the only person he scared

258
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,320
that night that's pretty much pleasure

259
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,880
to the country and then holy cow so I

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,440
mean was it that's so weird from then on

261
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,760
I mean it must have been a a lot more of

262
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,639
getting having to get used to that kind

263
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,040
of thing but yeah I mean I do remember

264
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,160
being a little older and and knowing

265
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,519
he'd be on that night I remember him

266
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,680
being on the delar ree show one night

267
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,200
which is a long time ago and and and

268
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,839
starting to feel the pride and

269
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,519
understanding that my dad did something

270
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:05,600
special yeah and then but that really

271
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:09,079
started cementing in more when I was

272
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,480
like 7 8 n years old I tell this story

273
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,440
in my show of the summer of 72 getting

274
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,839
to go on tour with my dad my mom and I

275
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,920
went on tour with him and it was Kent

276
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,000
State Summerfest Carnegie Hall those

277
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,240
were like three of the highlights we

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,680
went to lots of other places but that's

279
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,920
when it really became clear to me that

280
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:32,440
my dad was a God to people it was

281
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,000
1972 you know and um and that's when it

282
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,120
hit me

283
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that that he was something special and

284
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,279
and of course he always made me laugh I

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,800
mean you know um but there were awkward

286
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:47,360
moments too you know being a little girl

287
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,760
in an audience the only little girl in

288
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,720
the audience when your daddy says the

289
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,480
word [ __ ] on

290
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,560
stage at a certain at first I was

291
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,839
unconscious of how probably

292
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,760
uncomfortable that made other people

293
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,639
feel right and then when I got to the

294
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,079
age where I was realizing oh H I bet you

295
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,399
people are uncomfortable about this

296
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,120
right now so that I think somewhere

297
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,920
inside of me I was like oh I've got to

298
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,279
act like it's really okay right I'm

299
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,399
really cool with this you know when I'm

300
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,279
realizing maybe I'm not supposed to be

301
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:25,240
so cool with this right who knows but uh

302
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:28,160
but yeah I mean so so certainly dad was

303
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,720
an but for me it was you know TV I was a

304
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,519
TV kid I up in front of the TV so uh

305
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,760
Lily Tomlin for me was the first person

306
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,079
that I S I guess Lucy mhm um Lucille

307
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,240
Ball but Lily tommen was the first one

308
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,680
who was doing stuff that was like oh I

309
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,720
want to do that yeah I mean she was

310
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,079
playing a little girl right on TV you

311
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,399
know and it was like all the little all

312
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,800
the funny little girls in the country

313
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,800
could do that character sure sure yeah

314
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
of

315
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,800
course so good so I think my my first

316
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,680
you know besides Ethel Merman I think

317
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,480
probably Edith am was my first

318
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,000
impression so good that's amazing do you

319
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,040
um were you again we you don't have to

320
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,079
be I hate I don't I want I don't want

321
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,079
people to feel like they have to have

322
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,160
been Comedy album buyers but was it a

323
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,000
thing in the house to to buy a lot of

324
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,959

collection that he was colle he

328
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,440

329
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,959
told me were was going to be my

there he didn't play me a lot of comedy

335
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,920
albums he played three things that were

336
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,959
really really important to my education

337
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:56,199

things that he wanted to make sure that

341
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,040
I got an education on he probably felt

342
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,560

343
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:13,560

00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:07,240
was making my

361
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,680
dad laugh in a way that you know only

362
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,839
true comedy can can make you laugh you

363
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,440
know that real spontaneous love of the

364
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,120
moment and appreciation of it yeah yeah

365
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,079
was it a thing was it only sharing or

366
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,440
was it did he ever intellectualize it

367
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,040
with you or for you never

368
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,240
intellectualized it never ever never had

369
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,920
those discussions did he have that

370
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,720
interest that you know of was he I mean

371
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,639
was he picking it apart

372
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,160
ah boy you know I don't know being a kid

373
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,160
I really don't know that sure he if he

374
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,720
did he was doing it on his own or maybe

375
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,120
with friends but I don't know if he was

376
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,480
picking it apart I know he was he was

377
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,360
definitely a student I mean certainly as

378
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,120
a

379
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:57,279
child um Spike Jones and Danny Kay were

380
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:59,920
the two big influences on him um and but

381
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,120
no picking intellectualizing analyzing

382
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,279
it no it wasn't that wasn't part of the

383
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,680
game it was just a spontaneous enjoyment

384
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,519
of the art yeah definitely did you ever

385
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,759
find yourself at some

386
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,519
point doing it yourself and sort of

387
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,839
realizing you grew up in an environment

388
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,880
that allowed you to examine it better no

389
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:22,560
no not at all no I was uh an

390
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,440
unconscious uh kid I mean you

391
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,120
know it our house was there was some

392
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,519
years in our household which were very

393
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,160
very chaotic so for a lot of years it

394
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,279
was survival time there wasn't a lot of

395
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:40,639
time to be um even thinking about any of

396
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:42,800
that kind of stuff I knew for me

397
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,199
that and I was just writing about this

398
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,600
the other day there's something about

399
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,920
that place that Carol Brett or Lily

400
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,199
Tomlin or Lucille Ball would take me

401
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,560
there's that expanded feeling when

402
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,079
you're having enjoying a moment of

403
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,279
comedy and I knew I wanted to give that

404
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,720
to other people sure that's all I knew

405
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,559
about it that was as much as I knew that

406
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,520
I wanted to be a part of that that

407
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,039
magical expanded feeling however that is

408
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,079
or or that expanded feeling that I knew

409
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,439
my dad was creating in a in a live

410
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,880
audience

411
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,919
situation um as a teenager then for me

412
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:28,000
you know I was in high school 78 through

413
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:30,520
81 so Saturday Night Live was Valhalla I

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,120
mean it was Saturday night you you'd

415
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,080
gotten your money together so you could

416
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,640
get enough weed for the

417
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,320
weekend and hog and DA's ice cream had

418
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,120
just been introduced into America [ __ ]

419
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,480
oh no it was bong hits hog and Daws and

420
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:48,720
SNL man I mean you know and it was it

421
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,559
was it was the original cast of SNL it

422
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
was it was they were everything and then

423
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,799
there was Monty Python on

424
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,640
PBS and that was it those two things

425
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,440
were everything and affected I hung out

426
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,280
with some very funny people in high

427
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,799
school so all of our humor was

428
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,559
completely filtered through that it

429
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,760
wasn't standup it was sketch comedy and

430
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,720
one of our dads had one of the first

431
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,960
beta cams in LA and we took it for a

432
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,799
month and shot sketches every weekend of

433
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,679
just bad bad but fantastic sketch comedy

434
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,200
that we just would literally right in

435
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,080
five minutes like okay let's go do it

436
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,400
right now so good get our costumes and

437
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,159
whatever you know and um

438
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,360
and I wish it had survived I really do

439
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,320
it was all on VHS or something but that

440
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,120
was and for me like that's what I

441
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,200
thought if I was going to go anywhere

442
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,760
that's what I thought I would go towards

443
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,559
yeah do you do you remember the first

444
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,280
thing that you do you remember writing

445
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,600
like when you first decided writing was

446
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,200
something important to you or um you

447
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,880
know it was I was one of those people

448
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,720
that got caught up in

449
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,520
my confusion of my life in my 20s and

450
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,919
didn't have a lot of time to develop at

451
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,480
all anything except for survival okay uh

452
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,000
at age 18 I met a man who was 11 years

453
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,640
older than me and we did a lot of

454
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,799
cocaine oo wow wow so my although I was

455
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,559
interested

456
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,240
in I'm wanting to pursue and I did a

457
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,280
little bit wanting to pursue some acting

458
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,400
I didn't realize that I had no concept

459
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,240
of myself I had no idea of who I was

460
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
didn't realize that I probably should

461
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,679
have been at the Groundlings probably

462
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,799
should have been auditioning for SNL and

463
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,640
going that character comedic actress

464
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,200
route because that's really what I who I

465
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,360
wanted and what I wanted to do instead I

466
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,440
was in a very bad relationship and and

467
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,640
in [ __ ] up part of life yeah my dad

468
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:55,600
did which I show in my show my dad did a

469
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,400

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,280
2C okay and I have a copy of it holy

471
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,640
[ __ ]

472
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,159
and I said to him I want to be in it and

473
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,400
he and his writers wrote me a part as a

474
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,200
Punk Rock Girl Scout who comes to his

475
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,919
door to sell him cookies oh my God and I

show the scene in my one in my solo show

477
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,600
and when I went to look at it to put it

478
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,120
into the show and I'm watching the

479
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,720
footage and I'm

480
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:26,760
thinking God I had I had no training at

481
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,400
all and I had I had really good good

482
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,480
comedy instincts yeah and a friend of

483
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,960
mine and I'm not name dropping or

484
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,480
anything but it means something to me my

485
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,200
friend Lorraine Newman who's now a good

486
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,240
friend of mine saw that and said to me

487
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,919
why the [ __ ] weren't you doing this work

488
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,520
right you could have been in the cast

489
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,200
like right then and there and I and it's

490
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,080
like I didn't I had no concept of myself

491
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,960
at that age of course what happened at

492
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,760
that age was is I did that thing and it

493
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
sparked something in me but because I

494
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,960
had no real training and because I was

495
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,320
George Carlin's daughter which I felt

496
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,720
like I didn't never wanted to be put in

497
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,440
a situation where there was nepotism or

498
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,840
anything like that I didn't feel like I

499
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,640
had earned my my my stripes and so I was

500
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,240
still knowing that I wanted to do that

501
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,240
and everything but didn't quite had no

502
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,799
concept of it at that point either and

503
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,880
it took me a couple of more years to

504
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,039
kind of get my way out of the marriage

505
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,559
and all that kind of stuff and I ended

506
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,840
up going actually back to UCLA and

507
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,440
getting my Bachelor's degree um but I

508
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,760
look back on it now and I it really has

509
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,840
been happening to me lately because

510
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,360
about 3 months ago Second City there's a

511
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,559
show at Second City called

512
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,720
TMI um and they invited me to come and

513
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,520
do sketch comedy with them and they do

514
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,480
their show and I had a blast doing it I

515
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:52,559
bet and it was like 30 years later why

516
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,400
am I doing this now but um yeah you know

517
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,080
would have could have should have

518
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,520
right I'm doing it now what can I say of

519
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,520
course yeah um

520
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,960
did you I mean uh as far as developing

521
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,400
uh a writing voice uh did you ever have

522
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,600
I don't know did you ever have any kind

523
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,279
of conflict like you said being quote

524
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,400
unquote George Carlin's daughter did you

525
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,520
have any conflicts as a writer yeah it

526
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,960
you know the big Shadow thing was always

527
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:24,159
there it was tough um when I I met my my

528
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,600
husband that I my husband that I have

529
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,640
now my one and only husband no my my

530
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,080
second husband but really the the love

531
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,159
of my life Bob Mcall he and I started

532
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,960
writing in the early '90s uh started

533
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,279
writing sitcom spec scripts and that was

534
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,480
like enough outside of my dad's purview

535
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,159
that it felt safe to do that okay so we

536
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,760
wrote a bunch of spec scripts we ended

537
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,440
up writing a b movie that actually got

538
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,919
made it's Rose mwan is in it it's called

539
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,080
devil in the flesh oh yes of course and

540
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,360
we wrote it as a total tongue and cheek

541
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,039
comedy but you know it's be movie

542
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,000
Thriller we would like wake up in the

543
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,440
morning say how are we going to kill the

544
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,760
grandmother

545
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,720
I don't know how should we kill her

546
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,640
today we had a blast riding it um but

547
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,240
you know it was the The Shadow thing was

548
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,159
always big with me and um it's always

549
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,200
been hard for me kind of the official

550
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,880
Hollywood thing it was always terrifying

551
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,880
for me I never knew where I could fit

552
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,120
into

553
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,840
that um had a lot of issues around it

554
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,559
and then when my dad did his fox show

555
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:31,039
the George Carlin show Bob and I pitched

556
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:34,440
him uh pitched him an idea for a show

557
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:37,080
for an episode and he loved it and ended

558
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,480
up pitching it to Sam Simon and who was

559
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,480
running the show at the time we weren't

560
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,120
allowed to pitch it to Sam Sam did

561
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,320
wouldn't even allow me barely allowed me

562
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,400
onto the onto Warner Brothers he he

563
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,919
didn't like he's got a thing about

564
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,120
nepotism he really okay he you know he's

565
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,080
he's an interesting guy I'm leaving it

566
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,559
at that and bless his heart he's I know

567
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,200
he's dealing with serious health issues

568
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,840
right now um

569
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,039
but so we pitch it to my dad my dad

570
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,200
loved it and my dad pitched to Sam and

571
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,159
Sam loved it and my dad said oh Bob and

572
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,080
Kelly happened to pitch it to me yeah we

573
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,679
want them to write it so we ended up

574
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,000
writing an episode and having a blast

575
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,320
with that and everything like that and

576
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,480
we you know it's so funny how [ __ ] goes

577
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,880
down we ended up getting invited at the

578
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,960
time I mean this is like 95 I guess it

579
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,720
was at the Time Warner Brothers had this

580
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,039
amazing sitcom writing program yeah and

581
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,320
we got invited

582
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,080
to go and interview for it awesome which

583
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,640
was awesome right and but see I'm George

584
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,679
Carlin's

585
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,200
daughter and the thing about being

586
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,000
George Carlin's daughter is [ __ ] the man

587
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,880
right right and basically in my eyes

588
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,840
sitcoms and Warner Brothers were the man

589
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,600
right never mind that you know you get

590
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,640
on a staff somewhere and you write one

591
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,480
or two scripts of season and you're in

592
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,559
the room and you get great health

593
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,080
insurance and you're getting paid about

594
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,279
25 Grand

595
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,919
episode and you're in the club yeah and

596
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:07,200
that yes eventually you can go on maybe

597
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,120
to write a feature whatever you want mhm

598
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,480
I I didn't think about any of those

599
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:17,080
steps I just thought of the [ __ ] this

600
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,840
boy club [ __ ] the man [ __ ] sitcoms [ __ ]

601
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,480
this [ __ ] [ __ ] town I'm a real

602
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,520
[ __ ] artist right and I didn't

603
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,320
exactly say that word for word in my

604
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,799
interview but I'm sure the subtext of it

605
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,840
was there uh-huh uh-huh because um we

606
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,360
didn't get invited

607
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,520
in oh my God even though we had you know

608
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,120
a great Matt about you spec script we

609
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,039
had a great Seinfeld and we already

610
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:47,240
written an episode for a Warner Brothers

611
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:48,679
show right right yeah so um I did that

612
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,240
yeah and I've been apologizing to my

613
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,919
husband ever since right right we're

614
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,760
still married still loves that's good

615
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:59,159
and he gets it he gets it um but yeah

616
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,640
there's something about being a Carlin

617
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,760
and wanting to do it on your own terms I

618
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,200
guess and you know my dad he he was a

619
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,720
very lucky man you know he he had

620
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,720
moments like that in his own career

621
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,640
where he I mean he tells great stories

622
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,559
about when he was going through the

623
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,320
change going sounds like he having

624
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:21,760
menopause my first he's going through

625
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,320
the change you know um he had been

626
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,520
booked like a Playboy club or something

627
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,840
like that real straight place and he is

628
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,360
already done with these places he's got

629
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,000
the contract and he's got to do it and

630
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,159
he goes on and they're making him go on

631
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,840
because if he doesn't go on he doesn't

632
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,240
get paid

633
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,000
and and he'd already been fired from

634
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,840
Vegas I think at this point and um I

635
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,720
guess at one night he just laid

636
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,480
underneath the piano and read like the

637
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,240
little thing like I guess a little tag

638
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,120
just read that to the audience for a

639
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,200
while you know so I guess that was kind

640
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,559
of my phase of that you know I just was

641
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,279
like [ __ ] you [ __ ] you Hollywood [ __ ]

642
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,720
you

643
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,360
mainstream I'm a I'm a Carlin and even

644
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,960
though I don't I have I have no right to

645
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,320
be doing this because I have no nothing

646
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,919
to stand on because I have no work in

647
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,559
the world but I'm going to reject

648
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,760
you I I just love that that story

649
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,039
doesn't end the way you expect if only

650
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,240
because at his hardest in that scene

651
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,960
he's a child so childlike that is the

652
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,799
most brilliantly completely he's doing

653
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,039
performance art actually you know is

654
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,240
what he's actually yeah and that's

655
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,720
what's so beautiful and I and I and I

656
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,919
don't again I don't want to turn this

657
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,360
into a whole let's examine of his work

658
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,559
but obviously you're doing a show about

659
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,840
him and so his work is going to come

660
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,679
into it so I've always had questions

661
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,760
yeah that I you know which I probably

662
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
can't answer it's okay ask them but uh

663
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,840
but you're going to have a perspective

664
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,320
on it yeah uh uh the the change that

665
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,880
you're talking about

666
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,799
specifically where suddenly the hair is

667
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,880
tied back suddenly he's in all black

668
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,919
right suddenly he's reflecting something

669
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,679
he's never been before he goes for I'm

670
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,919
talking about your [ __ ] versus your

671
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,120
stuff too real really laying in oh

672
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,559
you're talking about that change that's

673
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,240
the CH that's the change that I I was

674
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,440
talking about the straight man the

675
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,880
counterculture George of course right

676
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,080
but that you're talking about the second

677
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,120
of course Counter Culture Georgia is the

678
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,840
one that I think I first and I related

679
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,159
to cuz I'm what I was in high school

680
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,880
when I first started listening to stuff

681
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,080
and absolutely beard and long hair yeah

682
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,960
you're talking about the change that's

683
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,559
the change that always sort of like hit

684
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,159
me so hard because as a as a kid I'm

685
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:25,200
growing up with class clown that's the

686
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,960
one my parents gave to me so that I

687
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,519
listen to it over and over again right

688
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,320
you know memorize seven words you know

689
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,720
all that good [ __ ] okay so I've always

690
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,279
been curious about and it's my own

691
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,080
ignorance for not going on Wikipedia but

692
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:42,039
I'd rather get it from you yes you know

693
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,600
what did you see that brings about that

694
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:47,440
sort of yeah that's a very [ __ ] the man

695
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,519
oh absolutely absolutely you know what I

696
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,080
mean even though some people The

697
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,559
Simpsons even gave him [ __ ] about it but

698
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,360
you know like it's still very well no I

699
00:28:52,559 --> 00:29:01,320
mean you know I think basically in um in

700
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,279
1987 he turned 50 mhm when you turn 50

701
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,679
things happen in your life right you

702
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,440
really do see there's definitely less

703
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,519
time yeah ahead of me than there is

704
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:16,519
before me and his mother had

705
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:18,960
died uh a few years before that his

706
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,720
mother was a huge shadow in his life I

707
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,080
mean literally the day she died when we

708
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,039
came home from the funeral he was a

709
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,120
different he was a changed man W there

710
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:33,120
was a burden lifted off of him yeah um

711
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,600
and I think uh it was the end of the80s

712
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,320
yeah we had just been brutalized by

713
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Ronald Reagan for eight years it was a

714
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,440
very difficult time to feel like a

715
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:49,279
freeth thinker in this country of course

716
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:52,240
and um and the [ __ ] was was just

717
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,919
front center for the country to see you

718
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,679
know there was no more hiding it you

719
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,679
know there was no more dancing around it

720
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,559
um you know

721
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,519
it I mean it's just exponential nowadays

722
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,360
but uh you know with the Iran Contra and

723
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:09,880
all that stuff it just all started

724
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,240
unraveling basically and and I think for

725
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,640
Dad between all of that that cultural

726
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,440
stuff his own personal turning

727
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:22,440
50 um and and he talked about in

728
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,399
particular Watching Sam Kennison yeah

729
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,600
screaming at the

730
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,600
audience and thinking why is he

731
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
screaming scaming because you have to

732
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,840
scream nowadays to get through to people

733
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,360
right because there's that much noise

734
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:42,080
mhm and um he had just you know he was a

735
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,039
man and I so get this because I so have

736
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,919
this inside of me I I'm constantly

737
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:49,480
wanting to evolve myself sure constantly

738
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,960
what's the next Horizon that I'm I want

739
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,960
to move towards the minute I get

740
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,559
somewhere it's okay this is great now

741
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:00,399
what yeah yeah and that's who he was too

742
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:05,320
lucky for us he was always finding his

743
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:07,840
next personal Edge and he just started

744
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,880
doing material that was just so much

745
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,399
more on the- nose

746
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,360
commentary directly you know about what

747
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,559
was going on and not feeling any need to

748
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,000
take care of the audience anymore right

749
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,840
there was something about that he he was

750
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,960
learning that and probably also I'm

751
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,600
guessing because he'd had enough decades

752
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,159
in this business and he knew he had he'd

753
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,320
already survived I mean like you know

754
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:42,000
and I talk about it in my show the late

755
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:45,080
70s early 80s he I play a clip of um

756
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,120
Rick Moranis from SCV doing an imitation

757
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,320
of my dad I've have not seen this clip

758
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,559
it's really great oh my God and it's he

759
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,320
does this thing on beets the vegetable

760
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,679
beets and he's like beats beats beats

761
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,519
beats you know and it's like the

762
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,440
ultimate you know in at your Naval kind

763
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,279
of observational humor and it's and it

764
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,440
and it I think it my dad was in some

765
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,120
ways very thin skinned and I think it

766
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,360
like kind of like destroyed him in some

767
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,639
ways like oh [ __ ] and the way I talk

768
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,799
about it in my show is it's like you

769
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:17,399
know he he was the straight guy was a

770
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,919
successful straight comic and then he

771
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:22,919
was the counterculture God he and prior

772
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,880
went out and changed the world and set

773
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,240
the stage for all these other comics and

774
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,600
um and then he he somewhat became an

775
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,639
institution mhm and he became in some

776
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,840
ways part of the establishment for these

777
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:39,120
young guys coming up and SCV and SNL

778
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,960
were just different creatures to him he

779
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,559
didn't he didn't he loved it but he

780
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,880
didn't get it you know it wasn't his

781
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,960
thing it wasn't his generation and I

782
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,960
think he realized oh I'm I need to

783
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,360
figure out who I am again so he that's

784
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,039
when he started to and that's when the

785
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,399
stuff stuff you know he started to kind

786
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,840
of build in that time and I think the

787
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,320
peak of that was the late 80

788
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,639
I think he talks about um the um what am

789
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,559
I doing a New Jersey show I think that

790
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,559
was the first one where he really came

791
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,600
out and had some things to say to the

792
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,480
audience and that we were all kind of

793
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,200
like o yeah wow this isn't going to be

794
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,840
cute and funny all the time you know

795
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,519
he's got there's a there's an edge here

796
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,760
there's an anger here and I think he was

797
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,760
really freed by that I think he really

798
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,279
was really really freed by it and then

799
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,240
jamming in New York

800
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,960
which I believe is is except for modern

801
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,639
man that one piece I really believe that

802
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,320
whole show is such um a tour to force of

803
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:42,919
his voice which he ended up building on

804
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:47,279
for another however many years 15 years

805
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,559
um but man that is just it's pure

806
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,919
perfection that whole show yeah and and

807
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,720
I and he really I mean he said and I

808
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,799
think he even said it to John Stewart in

809
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,360
97 you know that after 30 years of

810
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,559
comedy he realized he'd found his

811
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,279
artistic voice he' really found it

812
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,919
finally and he knew who he was

813
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,879
completely and he didn't give a [ __ ]

814
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,520
right anymore what anyone thought about

815
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,240
him and of course he did because he's a

816
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,320
comic wants people to laugh but um he

817
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,760
freed himself of something there that's

818
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,320
insane yeah it's just so it sounds like

819
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,720
it shocked you just as much as it might

820
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,720
have the tyal I mean it shocked and it

821
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:33,359
energized me because I was

822
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,399
um I always loved when he spoke a truth

823
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,560
and it shattered something in the room

824
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:41,720
sure there's something about that that's

825
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,119
so thrilling and so I

826
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,040
mean I think it's growing up at the

827
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:48,040
times I did and of course him being my

828
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,720
dad and and witnessing the country and

829
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,480
the way it went but you know truth

830
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,040
tellers have always been important in my

831
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,560
life and to have my dad be one and

832
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,800
telling a truth that and telling it in a

833
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,720
way that's poetic and funny and and

834
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,880
worldview shattering all at the same

835
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,200
time [ __ ] man it's it's it's exciting to

836
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,920
be in the audience when it's happening

837
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,560
and it's exciting to know it's my dad

838
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,359
doing that and and it and it gives every

839
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,240
one of us who want to express that in

840
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,160
the world great hope that we have a

841
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,160
platform to do this too sure and that we

842
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,280
want to dedicate Our Lives to that yeah

843
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,119
do you

844
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,720
I it's easy for an audience member for

845
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,680
somebody who is especially who is a

846
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,480
standup who gets to do a new hour every

847
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,440
year or every couple years whatever it's

848
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,040
easy for me to demarcate someone's

849
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,760
Evolution yes um harder maybe impossible

850
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,400
if you're the person doing it maybe a

851
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,720
little less hard if if somebody who's

852
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,079
related to them who gets to see that uh

853
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,760
but for yourself do you do you do you

854
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:55,839
get the opportunity to take a step back

855
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,200
and actually are there demarcated points

856
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,240
where you can look at your own Evolution

857
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,800
as a writer oh God yes I mean I I'm

858
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,599
um I got my Master's in Yi and

859
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,319
psychology so like my evolution is like

860
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,839
all I ever think about I mean I'm a I'm

861
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:15,079
a Storyteller that talks about myself

862
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,400
I'm an autobiographical Storyteller so

863
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:21,359
I'm always trying to find the narrative

864
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,400
through line in my life story and I you

865
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,520
know doing this show I did another onew

866
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,240
woman show in 2000 which really was the

867
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,680
first time I sat down my mom died in '97

868
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,839
of liver cancer and that completely

869
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,119
changed my life sure and of course and

870
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,880
but that's when I really knew it's like

871
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,280
oh you can be hit by a bus any day like

872
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,280
[ __ ] or get off the pot Kelly like if

873
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,560
you want to be a writer performer then

874
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,319
[ __ ] go do it you know stop sitting

875
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,400
around going well when will someone tell

876
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:52,839
me that I'm okay and I'm

877
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,720
lovable um and so I spent about 2 years

878
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,240
and just really walked through my life

879
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,480
and and and looking at my own life now

880
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,599
looking back on it now in this fine year

881
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,200
oh my God I can't believe it's

882
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:09,640
2013 um I mean I really see that I was

883
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,720
always putting my toe in the water and

884
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,560
checking the temperature and going a

885
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,400
little further in and then getting

886
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,880
freaked out and getting out of the water

887
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,640
sure and and I was really I was a

888
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,319
frustrated artist I was someone who was

889
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,680
in my home writing a lot thinking about

890
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:29,920
a lot of things but terrified to go out

891
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:33,599
in the world with it MH um never wanted

892
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,400
to be a standup never ever saw that as

893
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,640
something my dad even said to me I don't

894
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,480
want you doing that really yeah which is

895
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,000
a little difficult to hear sure I mean I

896
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,160
made my dad laugh all the time so I knew

897
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,720
it wasn't that right but a part of me

898
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,560
thinks well maybe it was that but I get

899
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,680
that he knew it was a [ __ ] up life

900
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,240
it's a life on the road is tough he saw

901
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,839
what life on the road did to our family

902
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,359
and what he had to end and he had an

903
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:05,520
audience he had an audience when you

904
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,240
don't have an audience it's a whole

905
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,599
different Road and then on top of that

906
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,160
being someone like him's daughter you

907
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,440
know I'm sure he didn't want me going on

908
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,160
stage and some drunk [ __ ] going hey

909
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,760
bring the funny Carlin out right oh that

910
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,200
would have been a fun moment I would

911
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,280
have thought I'd come back for that

912
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,560
though maybe I would have um so I never

913
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,200
wanted to be a stand up but I knew I

914
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,440
wanted to be on a stage say

915
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,960
something to people and impacting people

916
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,960
yeah and and doing it in a way right um

917
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,599
and so I I did a lot of tow in the water

918
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,640
and then back again tow in the water

919
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:45,520
back again and um wrote this onew woman

920
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,000
show in 2000 sent it to sent the script

921
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,359
to my dad it was really about my mom's

922
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,599
death and I had this kind of real

923
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,520
Awakening like oh like this amazing

924
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,079
Awakening I mean I guess you could call

925
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,119
it a spiritual awakening but really like

926
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,160
a a s sense of who I am and what my what

927
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,720
I felt my purpose was and and really

928
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,640
this experience that I had around my

929
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,280
mother's death and the intensity of it

930
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,960
and then also growing up in this kind of

931
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,480
crazy household that I grew up in and

932
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,280
being able to it was called driven to

933
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,720
distraction okay and the thesis was

934
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,040
basically like you know so many things

935
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,359
distract us from who we really are until

936
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,800
the very thing you don't want to happen

937
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,599
comes in your life which is the death of

938
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,119
something or something big and then you

939
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,480
can no longer really distract yourself

940
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,520
from it right and then you realize oh I

941
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,400
need to really live my life that's kind

942
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,839
of was the thesis behind it so I sent

943
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,200
the script to my dad and

944
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,920
um you know I hadn't thought about this

945
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,200
then but now when I look back on it I

946
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:46,560
can really see you know when people talk

947
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:49,960
about my dad and prior I really see that

948
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,720
they each occupy two different

949
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,160
universes because although you think you

950
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,560
know my dad my dad never talked about

951
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,680
his life on stage right I mean early yes

952
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,839
okay Tippy was on in there and and I

953
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,000
believe I said the tippy did a number 10

954
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,640
52 whatever what all what is um you know

955
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,079
and he he pulled from his life but he

956
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,520
never talked about his wife he never

957
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,119
talked about his drug addiction he never

958
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,359
talked about any of that prior on the

959
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,359
other hand oh yeah oh yeah would be

960
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:20,440
living his life and six months later

961
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,480
he's on stage telling you what it's like

962
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,800
to be on fire running down his driveway

963
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,040
right right you know I'm more like prior

964
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,880
uhhuh so my show was like that that yeah

965
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,400
and so my dad read it and he was very

966
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,440
uncomfortable with it oh no very

967
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,359
uncomfortable I didn't say anything in

968
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,400
it that he hadn't fully admitted in

969
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,720
public a doing too much cocaine that

970
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,599
there was a lot of arguing in our house

971
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,960
there was nothing uh you know Earth

972
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,960
chattering going on but he felt I think

973
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,040
he felt a lot of guilt about those years

974
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,119
and it just made him uncomfortable and

975
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,800
he said so but he also said I would

976
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,560
never stop you you're an artist and you

977
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,880
have to do this you know and of course

978
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,119
being the beautiful only child that I

979
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,920
was I was like I canel my run and I

980
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,440
ended up only doing it three nights okay

981
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,280
so once again I put my toe in the water

982
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,040
temperature fell a little warm this time

983
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,359
I thought better get out because it's

984
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,480
making daddy

985
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,119
uncomfortable and and that's when I

986
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,000
ended up going to grad school and kind

987
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,520
of taking a whole different direction in

988
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,079
my life uh in 2001 and then I got out of

989
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,720
grad school and was an intern for 2

990
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,839
years and literally the people that

991
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,160
started coming into my room as clients

992
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,880
MH were right ERS and standup comedians

993
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,720
and actors of course of course yeah and

994
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,440
it was like oh I'm supporting these

995
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,160
people's dreams helping them get out of

996
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,920
their own way and yet I'm the one who

997
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,800
wants to be out there on stage again

998
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,280
right and that's when I said okay I've

999
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,560
got to I've got to I've got to I've got

1000
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,640
to really go for this um and even during

1001
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,520
that time I did a lot of Storytelling at

1002
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,319
the time my dad came to see me once do

1003
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,480
it and uh he said to me Well you

1004
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,119
certainly know what you're doing doing

1005
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,880
up there yeah like okay Dad said that

1006
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,359
I'll take it I'll take it um and then I

1007
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,800
started working on a memoir because I

1008
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:10,079
knew that this crazy life story I had

1009
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,440
this journey MH being a woman trying to

1010
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,000
find my voice sure growing up in the

1011
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,480
shadow of someone who had a voice all I

1012
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,319
wanted to tell that story very much so

1013
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,559
and it included my mother and father my

1014
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,440
childhood and all that kind of stuff and

1015
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:27,319
I told my dad I was working on a memoir

1016
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,319
and he was like really

1017
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,720
really you know and so I went and I put

1018
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,599
it on a shelf and I really knew now that

1019
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,040
was

1020
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:39,480
2006 I knew I said okay you know what

1021
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,240
I'll just figure out something else to

1022
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,359
do until he's until he's gone yeah and

1023
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,400
then when he's gone I'll go do my work

1024
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:50,720
right and it's like a horrible thing to

1025
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,200
say m and yet I didn't want to make him

1026
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,359
uncomfortable I didn't want to step a

1027
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,319
and

1028
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:01,960
yet I look back on it now and I think

1029
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:04,400
well would have that have stopped him

1030
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,800
right you know did he did he care what

1031
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,640
people he was making uncomfortable about

1032
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,400
the things he was saying on stage ever

1033
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,200
sure no not really um but you know it's

1034
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,920
a different generation it's a different

1035
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I grew up differently than he did he's a

1036
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,800
man I'm a woman he didn't have a shadow

1037
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,760
like I you know there's all that other

1038
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,280
stuff but

1039
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,440
um you know so I feel like I kept

1040
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,640
pulling myself back and hiding and and

1041
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,160
going off and doing doing other work

1042
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,680
that interested me and was important to

1043
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,200
me and I think ultimately is serving me

1044
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:39,760
in my life 100% but

1045
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,119
um but you know it's like I you know but

1046
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,079
but the weird thing is too is that I was

1047
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,800
thinking about this driving up here

1048
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,920
that before my dad died I didn't know a

1049
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,599
single comedian personally interesting

1050
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,000
that's interesting didn't hang out with

1051
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,720
them yeah Dad didn't I mean I know dad

1052
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,480
knew them and talked to them and had an

1053
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,119
influ inced a lot of

1054
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,760
them um and I knew he'd go into clubs

1055
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,079
and he'd check out people and he was on

1056
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,559
the road and I knew and he had phone

1057
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,040
conversations and relationships with

1058
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,000
young Comics coming up I didn't know any

1059
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,000
of that until after he died by the way

1060
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,960
because I was living my life and dad had

1061
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,920
his life yeah um but I didn't know any

1062
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,839
Comics wasn't even part of the comedy

1063
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,720
world but that was Dad's life and yes I

1064
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,160
had some sort of little halfway entree

1065
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,640
into it but not not my world not my life

1066
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,040
right never went to comedy clubs in fact

1067
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,720
hate comedy clubs to this day I'll go

1068
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,079
see my friends every once in a while

1069
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,280
right but literally the day after my dad

1070
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,880
died these comic started calling of

1071
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,839
course and now and and really because of

1072
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,400
Rick Overton and Paul provenza and

1073
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:50,359

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:52,119
of connoisseur of Comedy um I am now it

1075
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:55,280
was so incredible that first year

1076
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:58,280
between my dad's fans and the comics how

1077
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,520
they embraced me mhm I would not have

1078
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:06,160
survived without them and because of

1079
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:09,160
that now I feel like I'm doing this work

1080
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,640
and it's a whole different entree into

1081
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,040
it you know I know I have to I know I

1082
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,720

right I have to have my craft I have to

1084
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,720
do the work but I get to have a

1085
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:22,760
different conversation with them now and

1086
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,680
I and I and I'm I'm really honored by

1087
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,559
that conversation really really honored

1088
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,200
that I get to be someone who

1089
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:32,440
gets to meet his fans and and talk to

1090
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,359
him and gets to to be with the comics

1091
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,359
now on a different level you know that

1092
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:39,640
you know they they I'm yeah I'm George's

1093
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:44,000
daughter but he's not here hovering I

1094
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,000
mean he is always hovering God help

1095
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,359
us but he's not physically hovering

1096
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,559
anymore you know I wouldn't show up

1097
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:54,800
going hey you know whatever um you know

1098
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,559
I feel like I've been embraced into the

1099
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,800
bosom of of these comedy

1100
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,079
you know ladies and gentlemen such a

1101
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,920
Beau a bit to kind of wiggle your way in

1102
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,160
there though you don't it's not enough

1103
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,920
to be oh no anyone's daughter that's not

1104
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,720
enough not in this [ __ ] not not with

1105
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,240
comedians so that's I mean that's what's

1106
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,720
impressive on its own I mean it has to

1107
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,559
come somewhat you a minute ago you're

1108
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,800
talking about the shadow but at the same

1109
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:22,200
time a second later you're talking about

1110
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,599
would he do this you obviously there's

1111
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,880
obviously something about him that you

1112
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,800
emulate is very important to you to live

1113
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,640
up to yes

1114
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,800
a standard a huge standard and a lot of

1115
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,000
people maybe in your position

1116
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,920
wouldn't the bitterness would maybe be

1117
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,680
overtaking them you know what I mean and

1118
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,640
to and to learn uh so much about

1119
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,359
yourself uh especially creatively as a

1120
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,599
result of just everything that you've

1121
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:48,800
gone through and again still to appeal

1122
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,400
to Comedians and impress them is you

1123
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,040
know it's a big skill you know I think

1124
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,359
the thing that my dad embodied and and

1125
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,200
therefore I embodied and my mother it

1126
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:03,559
too real I'm and and comics and everyone

1127
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:07,280
who knew my mom uh would stand behind me

1128
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:10,440
on this is we're an authentic family

1129
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:14,079
we're just authentic people and I think

1130
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,480
that in comedy that is everything yeah

1131
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,720
it is I mean especially nowadays it's

1132
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,760
it's all about being authentic sure and

1133
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,480
um and I think

1134
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,440
that

1135
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,440
uh I think that serves me more more than

1136
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,040
anything else in my craft learning my

1137
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,640
writing craft is important learning to

1138
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,119
be on stage has been is is is an

1139
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,960
incredible experience I'm having right

1140
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:42,200
now and and improving my writing all the

1141
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:46,400
time um but being comfortable in my own

1142
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:49,040
skin sure and really trusting myself and

1143
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,119
knowing that I belong and I deserve to

1144
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,119
be here just because of the fact that

1145
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,680
I'm willing to try hard and to show up

1146
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,839
and do the work um and that I have spent

1147
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,800
a lot of [ __ ] years working on myself

1148
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,160
of course I mean you know therapy up the

1149
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,720
[ __ ]

1150
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,000
yaoo

1151
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:10,200
um and uh and so I you

1152
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,599
know and it's but it's always a

1153
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:17,400
balancing act too you know because you

1154
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:20,559
it's the ego is such a little [ __ ] MH

1155
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,920
because it'll start to believe the press

1156
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,040
or believe what you know oh I'm part of

1157
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,160
this group now and oh look who's in my

1158
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,520
phone book and oh look who I hang out

1159
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,640
with and oh look who I can just call and

1160
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,839
look who texted me and this and my funny

1161
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,920
thing is my dad was always um star

1162
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,920
struck yeah and I'm always Star Struck

1163
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,920
too so a part of me is always like oh my

1164
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,920
God that's awesome that's so good though

1165
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,760
but the other part of me's like Just

1166
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,640
Breathe Kelly just [ __ ] breathe

1167
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,079
they're just another person they [ __ ]

1168
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,760
just like you

1169
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:56,119
do and um and and don't and and you just

1170
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,640
got to remember to kind of come back

1171
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:00,319
into your own

1172
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:04,400
skin say that we're all humans here

1173
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:08,079
we're just being real and um none of

1174
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,160
that Okie Okie energy I call it the Okie

1175
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,960
energy do you I mean I'm finding at

1176
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,200
least from talking to a lot of people on

1177
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,319
this podcast I mean this is 62 some

1178
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,040
episodes now uh I get the feeling and

1179
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,000
this is just positive makes me happy

1180
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:26,040
that the tears of the clown comedian is

1181
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,720
slowly maybe going I mean if if a man

1182
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,200
again it sounds like like you said it's

1183
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,480
you had you're a real family he doesn't

1184
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,319
sound like a man who tearing himself

1185
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,720
apart constantly and just you know

1186
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,400
filled with self-hate you know what I

1187
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,880
mean that's such a thing people really

1188
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,920
feel like they have to do that to be

1189
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,760
that you you know to be funny yeah I

1190
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:51,160
think he certainly you know he didn't

1191
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:54,880
have a daddy mhm I think

1192
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:58,640
he he had a you know his had some demons

1193
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,640
in his family absolutely

1194
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:07,799
um I I think he was a man who was very

1195
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:11,440
driven sure extremely driven

1196
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:14,559
perfectionistic uh and and over the

1197
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,400
decades you know but also a man who had

1198
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,200
Consciousness had the ability to finally

1199
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,680
witness himself and evolve I mean that

1200
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,880
is how one evolves is you you you start

1201
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,119
to be able to see your own behavior in

1202
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,720
an objective way so that you can change

1203
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,640
it I mean that is I think the definition

1204
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:36,720
of of evolution of Consciousness sure

1205
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:40,440
and um so we had that great ability so

1206
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,079
he was always working on himself but you

1207
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,559
know

1208
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:49,640
um yeah who doesn't [ __ ] have demons

1209
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,559
who doesn't have Darkness but I think in

1210
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,760
general I know at the end

1211
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,920
he

1212
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:02,599
um you know he he had found God we were

1213
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,200
at the um the Paley Center in Beverly

1214
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:06,359
Hills and they were doing a tribute to

1215
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,079
him one night it was just a few months I

1216
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:11,520
mean it was maybe like six weeks before

1217
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,079
he died wow and I think you can even go

1218
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,720
online and find it yeah it's incredible

1219
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,720
there was maybe 150 it's a really small

1220
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,599
theater at the Paley Center maybe 150

1221
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,880
people in that little theater oh God and

1222
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:29,000
he was I saw I saw in him that he got he

1223
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,079
was an elder Statesman mhm that he was

1224
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,359
the wise Shaman in the room mhm and that

1225
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,680
he was comfortable with that and that he

1226
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:41,240
was like this

1227
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:44,559
philosophical guy and I saw peace in him

1228
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:47,520
really did see peace in him and I know

1229
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,160
that his personal life I know he loved

1230
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,359
my mother dearly but they had a lot of

1231
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,359
baggage in their relationship from all

1232
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:58,079
those years I know that when he Met

1233
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:00,599
Sally uh Wade and were together until he

1234
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,040
died that he had a lot of joy in that

1235
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:04,960
relationship and I know he was tired of

1236
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,599
being on the road and traveling but he

1237
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,880
was always hungry to do the next bit

1238
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:14,160
right right he I I mean I have his

1239
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:17,960
computer there's probably the makings

1240
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,880
of two or three more HBO shows in there

1241
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,559
in very raw raw form but there are files

1242
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,640
and files and files of stuff that I

1243
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:27,040
really haven't even looked at yet um I

1244
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,640
mean I look at it every once in a while

1245
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,119
and just get overwhelmed by it all and

1246
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:35,640
think what am I supposed to do with all

1247
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:38,440
of this my chest gets tight oh my god um

1248
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:42,520
but I don't know

1249
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:45,040
the you know I I I do really though

1250
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,000
believe that people that comedians the

1251
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,599
more I learn about comedy and I thank

1252
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,559
Paul prenza for this because he's really

1253
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:55,000
made me a student of Comedy getting to

1254
00:52:51,559 --> 00:53:00,000
watch people

1255
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,400
um I look at what it's about and I

1256
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,640
really see that people say to me you

1257
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,280
know what's what's it like hanging out

1258
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,760
on them like they are the

1259
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,520
smartest and kindest for the most part

1260
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,480
the smartest and the kindest people I

1261
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:16,400
know yeah comedians yeah they're really

1262
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,240
sensitive souls for the most part but

1263
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,200
they're so [ __ ] smart they can't keep

1264
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,960
their mouth shut about what's wrong on

1265
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:28,240
the planet or in themselves because

1266
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:30,200
they're always digging and figuring out

1267
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,119
what's this mean what's this mean what's

1268
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,200
this mean and and putting it out there

1269
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,000
in such a way that um they're

1270
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,440
questioning it so that we can question

1271
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,839
it sure and and they're funny and

1272
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,280
they're funny on top of all of that

1273
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,000
because I think I do all that other

1274
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,720
stuff I mean I call myself a thinker and

1275
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,720
a communicator yeah and an instigator

1276
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:54,599
but I'm not driven to like get the laugh

1277
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:57,319
all the time yeah you know um but I get

1278
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:00,040
that drive of like so there is something

1279
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:03,240
about there's there's an unrest MH

1280
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:06,200
there's a famous Martha Graham quote

1281
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:10,040
that my dad sent to me probably 10 years

1282
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:13,000
ago and it is that an artist is Never

1283
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,200
Satisfied there's always an unrest in us

1284
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,920
there's always the minute you do

1285
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,559
something there's what's next yeah and

1286
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,640
so that Darkness I think is absolutely

1287
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:26,480
essential for a comedian for sure you

1288
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,880
know um whether you have to like hate

1289
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,839
yourself and be like killing yourself

1290
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,280
with drugs and alcohol and and scary sex

1291
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:36,960
all the time right I hope you don't have

1292
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,040
to be doing that I don't think you don't

1293
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,599
have I don't think you do no yeah I

1294
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:46,040
don't think so um but you know there's

1295
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:48,119
always that in every crowd for sure yeah

1296
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,000
um I want to make sure that we we uh get

1297
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:52,599
in uh that you can tell everybody more

1298
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,880

1324
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,359
the other thing that I do weekly that

1325
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,799
I'm really proud of and actually where I

1326
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:01,160
I really have helped me to discover my

1327
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,640
voice is my is my podcast which I do

1328
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,680
which is called waking from the American

1329
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,839
dream which I completely took that title

1330
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,319
from my dad's bit uh that great line he

1331
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:11,680
says which is the reason they call it

1332
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:15,079
the American dream is because you have

1333
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:17,359
to be asleep to believe in it and when

1334
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:18,839
he said that I went [ __ ] he did that

1335
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,839
again that

1336
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:22,839
poetry world view shattering [ __ ]

1337
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:27,079
thing he

1338
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:29,839
does um and came up with that title uh

1339
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:32,559
you know years years before my like a

1340
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,000
year after he did the show and then I

1341
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,440
just wanted the title for something and

1342
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,760
started doing a documentary and then and

1343
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,680
then he went and died my whole life

1344
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,359
