yeah I I'm I mean I my first documentary

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,880
is a sort of parody not a parody it's

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,680
not but it's like it's a parody in that

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,240
like the sport I'm talking about is so

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,880
stupid and so far removed from something

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,759
as cool as skateboarding that I had to

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,240
call it Lords of soap town so oh that's

41
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,320
hilarious long story but as to why it's

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,320
called soap town but yeah yeah yeah I

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,240
love those movies can I see that on

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,600
Netflix not yet I'm I I just signed a

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,680
thing to get it released on DVD good so

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,799
waiting for Netflix to come knocking I

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,920
think I have to knock at their door yeah

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,799
there's a lot of uh

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,680
buzzers and knocking and texts with

50
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,280
Netflix yeah yeah they're very busy

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,959
these days yeah yeah seems like it um

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,239
developing good shows um okay so why did

53
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,480
you pick this album because it's common

54
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,800
La last few months people have been

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,200
picking a lot of these a lot of Mel

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,879
Brooks and car r specifically these

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,280
albums yeah like I'm having to turn

58
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,680
people away well I think I think Mel

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,440
Brooks and Carl Rin are both having this

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,920
sort of Renaissance with people I don't

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,680
know if you call a Renaissance as much

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,840
is an appreciation of them uh Mel Brooks

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,120
and they they did an HBO special

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,519
together and um I think it all started

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,120
actually a while ago maybe maybe seven

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,800
or eight years ago when

67
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,560
um uh what's his name who's a sports

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,879
caster

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,239
um I'm gonna be no help he did a show on

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,640
HB Bob Costas it is Bob he did an

71
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,280
interview with them and and uh with Mel

72
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,760
Brooks and it just went on and on it was

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,799
supposed to be 1 hour special and he by

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,080
the end everybody in the studios nearby

75
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,959
had had collected in this one Studio

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,560
Sound Stage and he went for hours and

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,400
they released it as like a three-part

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,760
special or something um so I I don't

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,640
know if it started there but then um you

80
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,400
know they they just have done stuff

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,599
together I saw I saw Mel Brooks do a

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,319
oneman show in uh in Beverly Hills at

83
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,360
the David geffin theater and he'd never

84
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,080
done a man show before and he got on

85
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,680
stage I don't know how the hell we got

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,480
tickets like KPCC announced that there

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,560
were okay that there was a show and my

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,760
wife called in and got like we got the

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,439
last two tickets we were like in the

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,280
back row in the corner but it's a small

91
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,319
theater okay and he got up on stage and

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,480
uh you know in a tuxedo and he just had

93
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,720
a glass of water on a stool and a

94
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,319
microphone and he basically went through

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,040
his entire life from being from his

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,079
parents' life to being born to Childhood

97
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,239
in Brooklyn to being a young writer on

98
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,920
your show of shows all the way through

99
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,200
the movies he's directed and

100
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,319
interspersed he would sing you know he

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,799
wrote all those songs yeah Springtime

102
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,480
for Hitler and so he would sing the

103
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:19,239
songs as he told his stories my God and

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,880
I mean this guy did not miss a beat for

105
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,800
he he did 45 minutes and then said I

106
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,960
have to pee left the stage came back

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,520
five minutes later and did another 45

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,600
minutes so good and it was like you know

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,039
it was probably like a collection of

110
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,639
every story he's ever told on a talk

111
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:43,199
show on The Tonight Show or a panels or

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,000
wherever and so they just were all beat

113
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,560
it out and they were all full of funny

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,199
stories and jokes but heartfelt at the

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720
same time and and Carl Riner was out in

116
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,880
the audience and they they did some

117
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,280
2,000 year old man back and forth and it

118
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,440
was just a really magic night wow so I

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
think there there's been a bunch of

120
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,080
things like that and then they've each

121
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,280
gone out and done some podcasts which I

122
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,520
had Carl Riner on mine probably the

123
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,479
biggest thrill of any podcast I bet

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,479
guest that I've ever had and um and then

125
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,720
I know that Mel Brooks has done uh Chris

126
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,560
Hardwick I believe he's done Marin yeah

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
I'd like to get him on mine but I'm I'm

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,400
afraid to

129
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,840
ask he's such a hero to me sure no I

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,440
know I have yeah I I would say I'm just

131
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,000
as a I've sent the emails uh oh yeah

132
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,360
repeated repeated to no response whereas

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,680
Carl Riner I have gotten at least

134
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,479
responses you know but he's a he's

135
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,639
melbrooks he's a busy man he's a god

136
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,960
what are you going to do I had a dream

137
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,800
about him I guess because of this

138
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,919
podcast but two nights ago I had a dream

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,160
and I was um with Mel Brooks I forget

140
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,759
the context of the dream but I was

141
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,080
making him laugh and he really saw me as

142
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,960
like the best version of me like I felt

143
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,520
like this is what a perfect parent would

144
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,680
make you feel like it was definely a

145
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,080
father thing and I was young I was like

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,240
a little boy and he kissed me on the

147
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,440
nose and he hugged me that's amazing

148
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,880
yeah that's so good it was like

149
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,560
everything I dreamed that parenting

150
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,000
would be and that I never

151
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,160
got I I I mean I'd always wish my

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
parents were Jewish if that counts I I'd

153
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
go for that too that'd be fine yeah oh

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
yeah we'd all be a lot funnier with

155
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Jewish parents yeah I think so yeah

156
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
what's your heritage uh uh man you know

157
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,520
what I've been researching that a lot

158
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,880
lately uh found out just super German

159
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,479
which is what we expected my last name

160
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,000
is German yeah Eng super super Anglo on

161
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,120
one side and then I'm like three4 German

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,560
one quarter Anglo that's mostly it okay

163
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,280
with a little other stuff thrown in that

164
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm interested in but there's no proof

165
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,880
or yeah documentation just rumors yeah I

166
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,759
like those rumors it's fun but it well

167
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,360
you know I got on ancestry.com recently

168
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
me and Dave kachner kachner got

169
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,759
convinced that he and I are related

170
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,280
because we're so similar and so uh we

171
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,360
both sent out for the ancestry.com kit

172
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,039
and then you can once you do it you can

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,400
cross reference oh yeah your DNA and you

174
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,960
can see if you're related in any way I'm

175
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,919
still waiting for the results I should

176
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,560
do that I should my mom did the DNA

177
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,840
thing I want my dad to do it I mean I

178
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,960
hope they don't turn out to be related

179
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,759
but you understand I just want to know

180
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,199
my backround right I like the idea

181
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,919
though cross referencing you and a

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,199
friend who you think or hope you know

183
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,240
that's great I love that that's

184
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,240
fantastic um

185
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,479
so when did you first hear this

186
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,520
particular album and you you picked it

187
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,240
you said because it's all 2,000 year old

188
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,360
man whereas the other stuff is a mix of

189
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,800
just other interview stuff yes well I've

190
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,080
got um my well my initial connection to

191
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,280
this is growing up my father was a huge

192
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,720
Mel Brooks fan and so we we watched all

193
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,280
of his movies together growing up and

194
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,360
the producers was always his favorite

195
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,080
movie of all time which was amazing that

196
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,560
it turned into a Broadway show that got

197
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,960
so popular because it was kind of a

198
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,280
sleeper hit for him you know it wasn't

199
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,879
his well most wellknown but he we always

200
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,479
just felt like it was the most perfect

201
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,400
premise and the execution and the

202
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,960
casting and so I always had this very

203
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,919
emotional connection to Mel Brooks

204
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:21,080
through my father and then when I was

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,080
um I guess I was about 12 or 13 he

206
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,120
bought me the 2,000 year old man

207
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,840
collection which is three or four albums

208
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,919
from from the collection and uh just you

209
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:35,159
know wore them down listening to them

210
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,039
and then as I got older and my dad

211
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,159
passed away I started playing the albums

212
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,800
for my son we'd play back Amon when he

213
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,560
was probably about nine or 10 MH and we

214
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,519
play back Amon we listen to 2000 year

215
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,279
old man and it it landed squarely on him

216
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,519
he did nothing was missed I mean he it

217
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:59,240
is just so purely funny you can't

218
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,519
explain why all you just can stand back

219
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,560
in in awe and say this is a man who is

220
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,440
represents and embodies funny yeah and

221
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,279
you know when he talks about a nectarine

222
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,839
being the perfect fruit you know it's

223
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,160
the right temperature and I take a

224
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,640
rotten nectarine over a a fresh pear and

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,120
you know he would just repeat that and

226
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,760
uh and so he was he would repeat the

227
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,720
album and then uh one Halloween you know

228
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,120
again he's like 10 years old and we're

229
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,839
out in Venice Beach and we're

230
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,760
trick-or-treating and uh I go oh and

231
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,240
it's Mel Brooks and he goes somebody

232
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
dressed up as Mel Brooks I said no it's

233
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,519
Mel

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,880
Brooks and he turns around and there he

235
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,120
is and he's out trick-or-treating

236
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,360
because his son lives in my neighborhood

237
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,399
and so he was going out to trick or

238
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,600
treat with his grandkids

239
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,279
and my son said uh Mel Brooks he goes

240
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,079
it's so nice to meet you my name my son

241
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,160
I used to call him the mayor of Venice

242
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,920
introduces himself to everybody and he

243
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,120
says uh I you know he goes I love the

244
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,360

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,040

2000- year old man you're 5 years old

247
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,399
and he just was so playful and they

248
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,680
talked back and forth we took a picture

249
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,880
I'll give you the picture so you can put

250
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,399
it on your uh podcast and uh it was just

251
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,800
such a thrill and he was everything that

252
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,360
we hoped he'd be and uh and so um when

253
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,399
it came time to pick an album I I went

254
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,880
back through my albums and I wanted to I

255
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,279
wanted the one that had cuz some of them

256
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,839
have sketches that are brilliant also

257
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,519
sure but this is the one that was just

258
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,120
purely 2,000 year- old man you knew

259
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,839
Shakespeare told you know heedy cat with

260
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,880

shower shower come to be shower most

262
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,720
voice came are because of an poetica you

263
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,600
mean they sound like what they are they

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,800
sound exactly shower doesn't exactly

265
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,399

268
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,839
they added the hot water then you walked

269
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,440
in you went out

270
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,800
so very good okay see that's how we got

271
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,040
shower simple simple you mean all words

272
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,839
you think are Anam poetically B

273
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,360
basically come from the sound of well

274
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,959
how about the word egg egg doesn't sound

275
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,839
like an egg watch that chicken look at

276
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,720
that chicken study that chicken very

277
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,279
very very very closely yes I do I don't

278
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,519
see as produces an egg and you you

279
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,800
listen to it you'll you'll see the

280
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,800
chicken

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,120
goes that's that's that's and they they

282
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,360
pulled together different parts that had

283
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,519
some of them had appeared on other

284
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,000
albums I believe I think so and pulled

285
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,959
them all together and this is the

286
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,079
complete uh I don't know it's got to be

287
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,200
like 20 tracks yeah 20 uh 25 I think

288
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,720
yeah which is a a which actually

289
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
concerned me cuz I'm like wait how long

290
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,680
is this album I mean I don't care I love

291
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
it I'll listen to it all day but I was

292
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,240
like oh God I have to prepare how many

293
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,360
times I get to listen to it but it's so

294
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,000
fast y so incredibly fast and maybe you

295
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,200
know and I again people always expect

296
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,240
that I know everything about the album

297
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,360
we listen to it but like I don't know

298
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,639
how much of this is improv it does feel

299
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,519
it feels like 100% because he's so

300
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,079
Lively maybe he's got some stuff in his

301
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,639
back pocket I mean do you know enough

302
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,240
about it yeah

303
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,120
well the whole concept started out as

304
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,279
you know there was a

305
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,279
time in New York back in like the

306
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,480
1960s where people got together for

307
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,399
cocktail parties and they dressed up and

308
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,519
it was Lively conversation it was

309
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,279
intelligent and then people that were

310
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,399
funny would sort of just just take the

311
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,440
stage I mean you going you go back to

312
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,199
like darthy Parker but this whole idea

313
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,720
of you know reparte and dinner parties

314
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:42,320
and it turned into the first standup

315
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,160
comedy in a sense Bob newart who you

316
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,800
know his I'm sure you know you know

317
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,240
everything about these comedy albums but

318
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,560
you know he had never done stand-up

319
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,000
comedy when he recorded Bob newart

320
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,639
himself and it went won a Grammy and it

321
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,199
was a best-selling album and um so that

322
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,480
was the same thing it developed as a a

323
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:02,240
living room kind of a monologue and this

324
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
was the two of them at parties would

325
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,959
just make people laugh and it started

326
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,560
out as a 5-minute bit mhm and then um

327
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,440
and it might have actually started in

328
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,519
the writer's room yeah the Genesis of it

329
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
was it was they were in The Writer's

330
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,199
room for your show of shows and uh they

331
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,680
would just always [ __ ] off and so at one

332
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:23,120
point Carl Riner just says to Mel Brooks

333
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,959
so you're 2,000 years old what's that

334
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,399
like and he just made this noise and

335
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:30,760
that made everybody laugh was like this

336
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,199
sigh and uh and then from there they

337
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,040
started doing it at dinner parties and

338
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,279
it just grew and grew and grew and then

339
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,560
they put it out on an album and so when

340
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,959
they did tape it in front of an

341
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,440
audience uh from what I understand it

342
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:46,519
was probably about

343
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,040
75% you know they had the they had the

344
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,199
jokes sure yeah and then the rest was uh

345
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,920
you can tell the points where it's

346
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,720
something quick

347
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:00,720
because to me what what's so endearing

348
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,320
and compelling about the album is it's a

349
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,959
bunch of things but when you go past the

350
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,480
jokes and the material and the then the

351
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:11,720
character it's the playfulness and the

352
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,399
relationship that comes through you hear

353
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:18,120
two friends that are enjoying making

354
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,360
each other laugh and and who

355
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,959
are making each other funnier together

356
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,959
sure yeah and who don't step on each

357
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,000
other their rhythm is

358
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,160
impeccable and the respect that Carl

359
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,639
Riner shows Mel Brook in setting him up

360
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,160
and then getting out getting out of the

361
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,240
way he's the best straight man

362
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,240
ever it's true I which is funny too

363
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,199
because Carl Riner as he's one of my

364
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,480
favorite sitcom actors of all time and

365
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,560
playing Alan Brady is one of the hamiest

366
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,480
crazy but to be able to do that and also

367
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,959
be this guy this interviewer who is you

368
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,800
know I mean he's not he's not Bland

369
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,839
necessarily but he like you say he steps

370
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,360
out of the way a second he needs to

371
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,800
right uh I do like the moments when he

372
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,600
breaks so those are some of my favorite

373
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,240
moments on the whole thing you can tell

374
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,880
like he got thrown I love that so so

375
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,360
much and he still has that I mean when I

376
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,199
saw them at that show together and when

377
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,759
I've seen them on TV together he's just

378
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,399
enamored he's got a crush on Mel Brooks

379
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,040
it's beautiful and they get together uh

380
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,160
at night I guess three or four nights a

381
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,000
week they get together and they watch TV

382
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,079
they're very current on comedians that

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
are out there right now they love Sarah

384
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,680
Silverman and SC that's great yeah and

385
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,040
so they they have ice cream and they

386
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,720
watch TV and awesome yeah it's just

387
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,079
beautiful friendship and it's very sad I

388
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,120
mean they both talk like I had calll

389
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,480
Riner on my podcast and he said um most

390
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,800
of his friends are gone yeah you know

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,120
the guy's 90 years old at this point 91

392
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,480
yeah something like that I think Mel

393
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,800
Brooks is like 88 89 right it's crazy

394
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,720
and neither of them have their wives

395
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,160
anymore so now it's it's I mean if it's

396
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,560
going to be just them it's good that

397
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,519
it's those two yeah you know that's

398
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,079
great I mean for me I it's very selfish

399
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,360
like I love the idea of that I'm like I

400
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,680
hope I have that when I'm 90 [ __ ]

401
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,720
years old although it' be great to have

402
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
my wife too I'm not you know you guys

403
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,800
understand she doesn't listen to the

404
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,639
podcast no of course she does what is

405
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,519
she stupid uh yeah so it it's funny

406
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,920
because I own this album I have this one

407
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,480
framed on my wall because mostly yeah

408
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,399
because but more because Mel and and

409
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,680
Carl are both on it and I love the 2000-

410
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,959
year old man and then I realized when I

411
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,480
listen I'm like [ __ ] I haven't heard

412
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,279
most of these bits I've heard variations

413
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,560
on the other albums cuz I have the same

414
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,160
three album set that you probably got

415
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,759
with the two of them nose to nose

416
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,279
so and that's fantas but this one I

417
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,160
don't know there is something pure about

418
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,319
just 40 minutes of them just

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,040
bullshitting on this same character over

420
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,120
and the jokes are so dumb and that's

421
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,800
what's so delightful about it yeah do

422
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,480
you have a favorite bit on the whole

423
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,120
album or several bits or well I guess

424
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,319
the nectarine thing always makes me f

425
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,319
makes me laugh um I like uh I like the

426
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,759
silly stuff like when he says uh he asks

427
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,560
him about his pubic hair and he says no

428
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,759
my public hair he's talking about like

429
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,600
the hair on his head and his arms and uh

430
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,720
it's just

431
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:11,720
um you know it's it's the moments you

432
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,880
know um when he talks about like what is

433
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,360
the uh great mystery of the universe and

434
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,760
all the years you've been alive what is

435
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,000
the one thing that has always befuddled

436
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,199
you and given you wonder and he goes you

437
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,200
know when you eat asparagus and then you

438
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,840
make a number one what is that smell

439
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,280
and that's another one where you hear

440
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,880
Carl kind of like bend over a little bit

441
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,200
it's so oh there's you know it's funny

442
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,200
too is like it's it's kind of a it's a

443
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,360
pretty like it's a formula yeah it's a

444
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,360
great formula but somehow it works every

445
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,919
time he has so what was the name of the

446
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,679
first blahy blah and it's always like

447
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,080
Murray or Saul and somehow that joke

448
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,520
lands every time and I don't know why

449
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,440
yeah he goes uh he he goes did you know

450
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,720
Jesus and so he talks about knowing

451
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,080
Jesus and then he goes and what about

452
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,320
the apostles he goes yeah yeah the uh I

453
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,320
I I know the apostles it was uh Josh and

454
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,760
Lee and Barry and uh and and he goes

455
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,799
those were not the apostles he goes oh

456
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,799
my mistake that was William

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,240
Morris oh God it's so silly it's so it's

458
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,559
it's another two another sorry it's

459
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,760
another example of around the same era

460
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,799
of like um Alan Sherman and stuff where

461
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,960
Jewish

462
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,600
culture regardless of whether it's is

463
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,039
over the top is like an Alan Sherman

464
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,240
where he's just singing yish in a lot of

465
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,240
stuff uh where it's it's just appealing

466
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,200
to mainstream America and there probably

467
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
though a lot of them laughing and not

468
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,480
being sure why the same like same reason

469
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,000
I might have laughed at it when I was a

470
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,960
kid cuz I didn't know but it sounded

471
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,039
super funny to me um do do you think

472
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,440
there was like what do you think why do

473
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,400
you think it might have resonated so

474
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,799
well as it just the characters well the

475
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,640
Jewish thing really is is a big part of

476
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:03,440
it there's a very yish Rhythm to it

477
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,400
there's the you know it's like the old

478
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,640
Catskill comedian Rhythm but with really

479
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,960
intelligent stuff yeah and it is inside

480
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,600
but it's always accessible Mel Brooks

481
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:19,760
manages to always sort of Co-op that um

482
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,120
that that Insider feel of this language

483
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,000
that isn't even a language it's a pigeon

484
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,720
language that is as associated with

485
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,320
comedy as French is with with love and

486
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,280
you know uh German is with attacking

487
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,320
other countries and you know but he uses

488
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,200
yish in a way that lets you in you

489
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,480
always know what he means by the Yiddish

490
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,559
word sure yeah yeah and yet it's full of

491
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,200
it and it's like I was a member of the

492
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,520
I've been a member of the friar Club

493
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,919
since

494
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,120
1993 really and been around these guys

495
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,799
and I've picked up a pretty good

496
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,400
vocabulary of Yiddish over the years and

497
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,919
so for me to uh to hear him it's like I

498
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,880
feel like I'm back at the friers club

499
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,600
and I feel like he's part of that that

500
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,360
Spirit of these guys that I've come to

501
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,120
respect so much who went to the cat

502
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,240
skills not there was no comedy industry

503
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,679
back then you know that was a comedian

504
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,360
was being uh there was a job where you

505
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,320
went table to table while people ate and

506
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,320
you tried to crack them up yeah that was

507
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,039
your job and you did it for four hours a

508
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,520
day and then maybe during the day you

509
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,840
were you got to wear your towboy at the

510
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,240
pool on top of being I forget the name

511
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,640
of it but it's there was a job

512
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,760
description for this guy and they all

513
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,880
did it and they they developed chops and

514
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:40,720
balls and thick skin and this this this

515
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,280
there's something so um confident about

516
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,039
that Rhythm because it's

517
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,440
saying and here's where you laugh right

518
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,440
right and you needed that because you

519
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,960
had people that were eating dinner or

520
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,480
talking amongst themselves and you had

521
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,919
to announce in a way here's the joke

522
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,000
yeah you know and and so um so I think

523
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,880
the way he he takes that together with

524
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,440
um again just the the quick mind and uh

525
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,360
which you didn't see with Catskills

526
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,200
comedy that was the same guys doing the

527
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,240
same jokes forever sure and here was a

528
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,159
guy who was inventing brand new

529
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,520
character and uh and and situations on

530
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,440
the spot yeah and then throwing it into

531
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,760
movies that you would you know BL a

532
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,159
western right a western a yish western

533
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,840
essentially like there's I mean he even

534
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,120
has an you know the Indian chief

535
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,360
speaking yish which is one of my

536
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,279
favorite parts of that whole yeah that's

537
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:34,919
right that's right Lo and gain oh my God

538
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,919
the new sheriff

539
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:40,039
svat God sorry I I got to be careful

540
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,360
last time we talked just a couple weeks

541
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,919
ago we did uh 2001 years and we ended up

542
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,400
spending H 75% of it talking about

543
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,080
Blazing Saddles because it turned out my

544
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,799
guest was equally as big a fan as I am

545
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,240
who was your guest uh travels Travis

546
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,520
mroy from my brother my brother and me

547
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,559
and uh great guest a lot of fun turns

548
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,120
out he's seen the movie a thousand times

549
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,000
no kidding like he's kept track it's one

550
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,120
of those things I'm like oh well [ __ ] I

551
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,120
no competition here but we loved it just

552
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,760
as

553
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,600
much do you is there something about

554
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,799
this I mean again you're you're a

555
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,720
standup you're an actor but like is

556
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,640
this is any uh like The rhythms or any

557
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,520
of melbrooks like in you like you can

558
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,520
sort of feel it coming out when you do

559
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,279
when you're being funny or do you not

560
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,400
notice it it's just a part of you so

561
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,240
inherently that I think it definitely

562
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,279
comes out when I do crowd work because I

563
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,559
realized that what's funny like you said

564
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,880
with Mel Brooks is that it's it's quick

565
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,039
it's not necessarily the first word he

566
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,360
says is funny it's that his rhythm of

567
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,240
answering

568
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,919
immediately is is just it just makes you

569
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,159
laugh and I think when I do crowd work I

570
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,400
do that I'm going tell you the truth

571
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,600
about all the Jewish Mothers and Fathers

572
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,320
and the Jewish in-laws you're talking

573
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,799
about mine and all yes this is the truth

574
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,799
about them they all are prideful yes and

575
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,240
spiteful yes and they all for instance

576
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,000
me when I was a kid when I got married

577
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,880
it was in caves caves you lived in a

578
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,039
cave cave you were living in a cave and

579
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,880
your we made dinner we said pop M come

580
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,600
over come over for dinner and you know

581
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,840
the Jewish Mothers and Fathers they came

582
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,360
over with a terrible rainstorm they're

583
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,559
standing outside the cave I said come in

584
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,360
p no I'm all right here you mean he was

585
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,200
standing outside the cave I'm fine I'm

586
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,279
fine he was standing outside the cave I

587
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,159
said I said P training my training on

588
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,480
you no we all

589
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,880
right we all right we don't have to come

590
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,240
in we just want to look at you dangerous

591
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,799
out here

592
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,080
I mean they were they're nuts so finally

593
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,960
what what what brought them into we

594
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,120
pushed them in can we take your Cod let

595
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,279
me take your no it's all right I'll kick

596
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,880
my coat oh they wouldn't even give you

597
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,679
their coat sit down no standing is good

598
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,679
and oh sit down we made dinner for you

599
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,279
no we ate we ate on the dinosaur on the

600
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,320
way over you know I asked people

601
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,520
questions then I I react to them and the

602
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,039
the quality of the joke is inversely

603
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,840
proportional to the speed at which you

604
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:03,520
get it out and and so speed is of the

605
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:06,039
essence and uh and so you know you I I

606
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,640
think I I definitely pick up on that and

607
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:10,960
I and I think I also pick up on the

608
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,640
structure of you know he was one of the

609
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,240
first great improvers I mean this was I

610
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,400
guess at a time when Second City was

611
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,559
just coming up sure and uh you know he

612
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,559
was definitely um you know at the same

613
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,159
level as these guys were in terms of

614
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,120
just the basics of accept you know MH

615
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,080
even and I but I'll also give him credit

616
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,799
cuz he that son of a [ __ ] can deny

617
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,320
better than anybody else too if he has

618
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,960
to you know he can do it in such a way

619
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,840
oh that's true yeah he's not when I

620
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,720
guess when I say except maybe except

621
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,080
that the bit is going to keep going oh I

622
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,760
see what you mean oh okay okay okay okay

623
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,480
yeah but but not the not the

624
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,080
improvisational yes and as

625
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,799
okay but to extend things okay I see

626
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,520
what you're saying to to to go blindly

627
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,120
forward with a bit even when you don't

628
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,159
necessarily know where it's going or

629
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,159
what you have oh man cuz there the one

630
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,240
or two genuinely felt like curveballs

631
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,600
cuz even Carl's like I'm trip you up

632
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,600
like I'm going to trip you up why is a

633
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,480
nose called a nose and he comes up with

634
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,880
what are you going to do blow your eyes

635
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,640
yeah so stupid but again that's exactly

636
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,080
that is one of the fastest bits on it

637
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,799
and it feels so off the cuff that I have

638
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,120
trouble believing that was a bit already

639
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,200
right maybe he even had notes he's like

640
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,240
all right here's where I'm going to [ __ ]

641
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,880
with him yeah like I don't know but oh

642
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,039
man I'm trying to also picture what kind

643
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,480
of what kind of an audience we're

644
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,840
dealing with here too because they're

645
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,840
going nuts I can't tell the size but I

646
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,559
can't remember if they did it in a I

647
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,840
think they did it on like a recording

648
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,919
studio Sound Stage okay okay um I think

649
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,559
they did a series of nights and then

650
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,080
they pull together the best stuff makes

651
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,399
sense don't quote me on that but I

652
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,080
believe that's what it was you know you

653
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:47,559
should have I have a thing on my podcast

654
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,559
where it's called Fitz dog fiction and

655
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,720
when I say something that's not true

656
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,840
people email me and then I read the

657
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,080
corrections on the next episode see I

658
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,679
you know what that actually is probably

659
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,200
a better way to do it than wait for

660
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,039
people to get pissy with me which by the

661
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,120
way does not happen a lot I have a very

662
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,760
cool audience like gen genuinely very

663
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,279
cool I've gotten one one comment where

664
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,159
this guy was so pissy about me not

665
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,120
knowing something and I emailed him back

666
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,880
yeah I had I kept a cool head and I just

667
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,080
said listen I don't know everything but

668
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,240
I like this idea of just inviting it I

669
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,360
think if you invite it people aren't

670
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,520
going to be dicks about it no they love

671
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,600

682
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,320
am I saying it's all the it's so silly

683
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,840
like these little bits so is this one of

684
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,480
the albums did you play all the albums

685
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,000
for you for your son oh yeah yeah so

686
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,279
good and uh and then we watch blazing I

687
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,520
don't want to get to Blazing Saddles but

688
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,000
but I showed him Blazing Saddles

689
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,640
probably younger than I should have

690
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,240
right but um cuz there there is you know

691
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,919
the whole thing about uh the hooker

692
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,679
[ __ ] the black sheriff and the size

693
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,320
of his penis there's a lot of stuff that

694
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,760
would there a little but I just figured

695
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,279
you know who gives a [ __ ] yeah yeah and

696
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,200
so but I I haven't shown on the

697
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,559
producers yet maybe I'll do that when he

698
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,760
he's away but when he gets back might

699
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:28,960
one of the best things about having uh a

700
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,760
child is waiting and then sharing a

701
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,360
movie with them that that's special to

702
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,240
you I bet I bet something that so but

703
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,919
then it's so hard with Blazing Saddles

704
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,000
because there's so much irony to Wade

705
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,159
through but it just he's he's good to go

706
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,080
like I guess if he's raised with a

707
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,360
comedian dad I you know maybe it's

708
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,159
easier to I think so and and you know

709
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,519
even though some of the stuff they they

710
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,640
are references he's not going to get it

711
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,919
doesn't matter because it's it's there's

712
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,760
a music to it that you just get into

713
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,799
yeah my parents wouldn't let me watch it

714
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,000
no no I don't think I saw till I 16 and

715
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,600
then it changed my life really yeah like

716
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,880
everything became about doing what he

717
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,320
was doing with that movie and then

718
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,840
getting really pretentious about it too

719
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,080
I had that stage um man the prod did you

720
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,559
like the producers musical we're going

721
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,519
to go down this path just for a minute I

722
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,000
didn't did I see it I don't I don't

723
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,679
think I saw okay the problem is I would

724
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,760
just say listen to the soundtrack rather

725
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,600
than see the movie version really I

726
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,799
don't like the movie version nothing

727
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,679
against anybody in it oh the movie

728
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:28,320
version M sorry the movie version of the

729
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,919
play yes the original movies Fant yeah

730
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,919
it's not it's not it's not fun the

731
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,559
musical's great I just don't there's a

732
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,760
few things in life that you just say you

733
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,440
know leave it alone they just nailed it

734
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,240
yeah you know like I remember hearing

735
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,320
like Shia Twain redo Wild Nights by Van

736
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Morrison and just like you're oh you're

737
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,399
GNA do it better than Van Morrison are

738
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,919
you you gonna take one of his most magic

739
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,399
upbeat songs ever right a song that

740
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,399
people [ __ ] floss and do their hair

741
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:01,120
to while they get excited about going

742
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:04,120
out into the night to discover Bliss the

743
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,480
soundtrack of Joy you're going to take

744
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,080
that you [ __ ] dumb [ __ ] can I curse

745
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,960
on your show you certainly can oh my God

746
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,320
I got and you know what it wasn't Shania

747
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,000
Twain I'm I'm gonna look it up because I

748
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,840
don't want your listeners emailing you

749
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,760
sure sure well they again they can

750
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,679
correct you uh that's fine they can send

751
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,840
those corrections to you that's okay uh

752
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:27,480
if anybody hears us you know

753
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,960
uh oh John Cougar melon Camp covered it

754
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,600
that's oh yeah that's oh yeah I remember

755
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,960
that and that's just he made it whiter

756
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,200
than was necessary oh my God he watered

757
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,200
it down and oh and then the worst thing

758
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,480
is then you meet young people who don't

759
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,360
know about the original version

760
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,159
yeah yeah I mean that's they've talked

761
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,320
about like a Blazing Saddles musical too

762
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,880
and I don't know why that would I first

763
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,600
of all you I we talked about this last

764
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,519
time you can't say the N word on on a

765
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Broadway state alth do they ever say it

766
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,600
or does the Bell go off cover a ton they

767
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,519
a ton yeah just you might not think

768
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,399
about it though like because the movie

769
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,600
is so silly and cartoonish that I you

770
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,760
know um well let's get back to the the

771
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:15,240
the let's get off Blazing Saddles sorry

772
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,559
it'll it'll happen um so did you uh have

773
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,880
you heard did you hear when they did the

774
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,000
2000-year old man in the year 2000 which

775
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,799
was like the last one they did what do

776
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,120
you think of that one I loved it yeah I

777
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:28,039
loved it you know it was

778
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,120
like it was it felt like two masters

779
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,519
just doing an overview you know it

780
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,559
didn't feel like they were

781
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,480
necessarily breaking tons of new ground

782
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,000
but they were going through it again and

783
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,720
and it was showing that Mel Brooks was

784
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,159
as sharp as ever and is you know what

785
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:48,200
sharp means is

786
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:51,559
IQ plus guts yeah yeah you know comedy

787
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,120
is really about risk reward and can you

788
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:57,600
go for a joke that's silly mhm and not

789
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,320
be ashamed if it doesn't work right yeah

790
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,960
that's part of that is having the trust

791
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,360
with your partner mhm which they which

792
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,120
they have probably even in Spades more

793
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,679
more than they did before I think their

794
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,919
relationship is probably stronger now

795
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,480
than it ever was yeah so uh no it felt

796
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,360
you know it felt a little more Pat they

797
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,840
had it down but uh but he was just as

798
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,919
quick I think he thrives and again this

799
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,080
is just total conjecture but I think he

800
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,360
thrives

801
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,399
on on Variety in such because like every

802
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,080
time you saw him do a oneman show what

803
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,440
is great is if you'd seen him do it the

804
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,120
next night my guess is every story would

805
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,039
have changed a little bit because every

806
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,159
time I've heard him tell a story I love

807
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,840
them every time they change every time

808
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,840
I've seen them live a few times same

809
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,039
thing like one night totally different

810
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,679
to the next night just cuz you're like

811
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,120
yeah you know the crowd wants this or

812
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,120
this is what I want to hear myself say

813
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,880
tonight you saw Mel Brooks live a couple

814
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,200
times uh let's see I want to say 2007

815
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,559
let's say 2007 six or seven not doing a

816
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,000
oneman show not doing a oneman show no

817
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,039
but he was doing um q&a's after Young

818
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,200
Frankenstein Blazing Saddles and the 12

819
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,880
chairs those are the three I saw was it

820
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,840
at the the theater the god it wasn't at

821
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,720
the silent movie it was one it was

822
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,480
closer to over here somewhere in Santa

823
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,080
Monica yeah uh and I don't remember

824
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,799
where the hell it was that one man show

825
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,559
I saw apparently is the first and last

826
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,080
time he ever did had feeling cuz I had

827
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,720
never heard of it and I now I want to

828
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,039
record and he clearly rehearsed it for

829
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,519
nine months that's crazy yeah that's so

830
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,440
crazy I know but yeah like between those

831
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,279
three nights that I saw him and was like

832
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,279
five away from him and didn't get to say

833
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,600
anything person I was with had the guts

834
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,519
to say can I have a hug and he gave him

835
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,399
a hug he did I wish I'd have done that

836
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,919
yeah yeah but uh yeah I would ask for a

837
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,360
kiss on the nose yeah right a kiss on

838
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,880
the nose is fantastic from Mel Brooks

839
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Christ H but yeah it it was different

840
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,679
every night and I think he thrives on

841
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,039
that like at the very least that just

842
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,960
that variety but then most Comics do am

843
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:53,279
I wrong is that or do you do you like

844
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,760
having a set tight and good to go like

845
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,559
what's important to you well there's a

846
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,919
gestation period for me as a comic where

847
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,720
I come up with a new bit and obviously

848
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,720
it's very loose I I don't really write

849
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,279
it out I find it on stage and then if

850
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,880
there's something there then you try to

851
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,399
stretch it out and push it and see how

852
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,600
much more you can get like I feel like

853
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,639
every bit every idea has a certain

854
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,360
yardage you can get out of it some end

855
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:22,919
up being just like on liners and some

856
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,760
end up being stories and some of them

857
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:30,000
end up being um just jokes that have you

858
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,720
know uh a lot of Beats to them and the

859
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,559
longer I do them the more they get to be

860
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,200
word for word and that's when they

861
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,120
usually end up getting pushed to the

862
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,440
closing bit once they get strong enough

863
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,039
and then I sort of take them out once

864
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,360
they once I get tired of saying them and

865
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:46,480
you sort of say when I do my next album

866
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,200
I'll you know it'll be a collection of

867
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,080
12 five minute chunks that have each

868
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,679
been sort of locked down Jesus oh nice

869
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,320
lovely thin the I yes I mean is he as

870
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,279
wor sandals he wor s very much as he's

871
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,799
pictured today in the motion pictures

872
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,760
that we see of him why do they made a

873
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,519
travesty of it you mean that Jesus

874
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,520
Christ throwing over the tables and

875
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,760
knocking over things well didn't Jesus

876
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,200
behave that way no he was quiet a quiet

877
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,839
lad he didn't do that no he came in the

878
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,000

feel like it it's not necessarily I do a

892
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,679
new hour every such and such for you no

893
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,200
no I'm not one of those guys you don't

894
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,280
mind you don't mind doing a bit if it

895
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,839
still works or still feels good to to do

896
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,000
yeah I feel like I want to give the

897
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:01,040
audience the best I can and if that

898
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,520
means in a on a Friday night late show

899
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,240
when they're really talking and a little

900
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,200
bit dumb and drunk that you know

901
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,240
something new and elegant is just going

902
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,400
to get [ __ ] on and it's going to make me

903
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,119
feel bad and lose confidence in the bit

904
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,599
right so I'm gonna I'm going to

905
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,000
downshift and do some older stuff get

906
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,240
through the night and know that the

907
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,280
Saturday night first show is going to be

908
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,040
all fresh new fun stuff yeah that's a

909
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,400
really you know for a comic that's a

910
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,040
really good like defense mechanism

911
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,160
rather than just [ __ ] on everybody

912
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,040
just like I'm going to do the stuff that

913
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,800
I know will work or like you said I

914
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,240
don't want it to be [ __ ] on I love that

915
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,240
that's great well and also I feel like I

916
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,839
owe them a good show like I don't blame

917
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,240
them for being drunk or whatever it's

918
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,680
like you know it's Friday night and so

919
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,240
my job is to make it a good experience

920
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,960
for me and them uh you know I don't I

921
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,680
don't believe that there's a bad crowd

922
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,599
necessarily they may not be as effusive

923
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,440
as you like but they're a bunch of

924
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,560
strangers they're not they didn't come

925
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,319
together together and and decide to be

926
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,000
shitty yeah so you know for the people

927
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:04,920
that aren't shitty you just have to give

928
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,839
them a good

929
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,319
show do you can we are we able to

930
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,599
there's no [ __ ] segue for this so I

931
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:12,960
apologize can we talk about can we talk

932
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,200
about the Cosby stuff a little bit do

933
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,560
you mind sure okay so I have consciously

934
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,760
avoided letting people talk about Cosby

935
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,480
on the show if they bring it up I say

936
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,520
fine but you know we have to talk about

937
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,920
such and such yeah we have to talk about

938
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,200
the garbage but you you've been going

939
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:35,000
out of your way to sort of reclaim his

940
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,599
stuff a way how what made you decide to

941
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,640
do it well you know the whole causby

942
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,400
thing came up and watching him watching

943
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,800
this statute of limitations thing kick

944
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,880
in when all these women who have

945
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,280
suffered are being humiliated again

946
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,720
first they're humiliated by being

947
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,000
assaulted then they're humiliated by

948
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,440
being called Liars by him and yet he's

949
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,800
still touring so while he was still

950
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,359
touring I said how do we hurt him and I

951
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,680
said well what would hurt me the most if

952
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:03,720
somebody stole my material mhm and so I

953
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,920
figured that's that's what I'm going to

954
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,119
do and I just started going out on stage

955
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,760
and doing Cosby bits and and you know

956
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,280
announcing that they were Cosby bits and

957
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,319
then it would always Veer into him

958
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,240
raping somebody in the job of course of

959
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:19,880
course you know and so and so uh I did

960
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,359
it and uh but I would do the bits like

961
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,040
word for word and then I would throw in

962
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,040
something rapy mhm and uh and then the

963
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,400
the the guardian picked it up and wrote

964
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,880
a story about it m and and then um NPR

965
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,560
did a piece on it and and then Daniel

966
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,040
TSH stole the bit and did it did you

967
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,800
hear about this no I didn't hear about

968
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,319
that but I'm not surprised oh is he got

969
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,880
a reputation for that he's just got a

970
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,560
reput let's move on from my opinions of

971
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,240
him but you can tell you've got facts to

972
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,560
go off well that's it he did he did the

973
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,839
exact bit yeah that blows yeah is it is

974
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,319
it considered okay would it be you

975
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:58,200
probably I'm sure you're not considering

976
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:59,960
this but would it be satire if you did

977
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,000
that as an album you pick your favorite

978
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,720
Cosby bits you do greatest hits you do

979
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,520
it your own way but is it I don't know

980
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,520
well the problem is there's a couple

981
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,040
problems one is you don't want it to be

982
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,240
seen as a celebration of you know his

983
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,599
Anthology yeah so I think the thing to

984
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,160
do would be if you got 10 comedians to

985
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,280
each do one bit okay and they all end in

986
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,800
rape yeah then that might be something

987
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,119
but the other thing that's difficult is

988
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,480
that it's very it's very hard to

989
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,599
duplicate his style it's very slow okay

990
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,240
yeah and it's physical and its facial

991
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,200
expressions and on the page there's not

992
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,200
that much to work with yeah I mean on

993
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,880
some of his earlier bits yeah but the

994
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,760
the the longer he did it the more it

995
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,319
became you know yeah dramatizing

996
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,040
something and um it's it's a tribute to

997
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:51,240
him I mean look you can't take away the

998
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,560
fact that the guy is one of the greatest

999
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,800
comedians of all time right no no so

1000
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,400
um you know It's Tricky and I think the

1001
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,359
other thing I was trying to get at by

1002
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,160
doing it is whether or not like whether

1003
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,680
it's Roman palansky or Woody Allen or

1004
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,760
name your favorite [ __ ] NBA player

1005
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,160
that choked his girlfriend like whether

1006
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,599
or not you can appreciate the art of

1007
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:20,000
what somebody does if you object to them

1008
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:23,040
personally um so I I wasn't putting it

1009
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,240
out as an answer to that but just as hey

1010
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,079
here's an interesting thing to think

1011
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,079
about sure well and that's that's the

1012
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,480
way have to do it I mean good art is

1013
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,560
better at asking questions than it is

1014
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,160
giving answers I think and then in in a

1015
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,400
case like this like it's also the only

1016
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,280
well I won't say only because I don't

1017
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,920
want to limit you know but it's one of

1018
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,440
the few ways we're making a rape joke is

1019
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,160
clearly about making fun of the rapist

1020
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,280
right you know and and I don't know I to

1021
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,880
me like it's it's it's a solid piece of

1022
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,119
performance art if nothing else but it

1023
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,880
also is a great I wish I'd have seen you

1024
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,119
do it I mean but you're right though I

1025
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,400
hadn't thought about the idea that it is

1026
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,240
so him it is so expressive that it would

1027
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,800
be hard to imitate yeah we've talked

1028
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,400
about on the show The this idea that I

1029
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,880
had years ago where I've wanted to do uh

1030
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,359
a night of covers but I've asked

1031
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,000
comedians I'm like what do you think if

1032
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,040
10 people got up and did their favorite

1033
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,480
Carlin bit uh would it work does that

1034
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,920
work and some people are like great

1035
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,520
that's a great idea but I'm also

1036
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,040
hesitant to ask because I'm like does

1037
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,920
that work as a thing well Jim Brewer

1038
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,720
used to do that in New York yeah and he

1039
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,119
would have he would like I went up and

1040
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,680
did a Steve Martin bit and it's great

1041
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,720
people [ __ ] love love it because what

1042
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,920
comes through is you see comedians doing

1043
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,960
their favorite comedian and so you kind

1044
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,560
of see their love and passion for that

1045
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,680
comedian come out okay in their

1046
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,359
commitment to doing that material yeah

1047
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,960
and you don't not everybody did it in

1048
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:44,960
the same tone MH some people did perfect

1049
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,359
Impressions sure I found that to be less

1050
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,839
interesting than somebody who just was

1051
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,359
kind of doing it their way a little bit

1052
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,880
but um yeah I did a Ste I did an old

1053
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:56,920
Steve Martin thing and and uh it felt

1054
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,200
really good I enjoyed it do you know

1055
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,720
what bit did yeah it was called what I

1056
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,319
believe it was there was an album called

1057
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,400
The Steve Martin Brothers yes where half

1058
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:09,960
of it was banjo music and the other half

1059
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:13,319
was him giving this very sincere

1060
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,480
speech and there's this there's this um

1061
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:18,200
kind of

1062
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,720
sweeping uh patriotic music playing in

1063
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:25,119
the background and he says what I

1064
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,680
believe I believe in rainbows and puppy

1065
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:32,280
dogs and Uncle Ernie who waves his

1066
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,040
penis I believe in nine out of the Ten

1067
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,680
Commandments and I believe that all

1068
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,280
people should be allowed into this

1069
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,280
country provided they speak our native

1070
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,280
language

1071
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,319
Apache I I can't it goes on for like six

1072
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,319
minutes that's the one Steve Martin

1073
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,520
album I don't own so that's why that's

1074
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,319
also very new to me I but you know and

1075
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,960
it's funny is for somebody like yourself

1076
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:59,880
who again is like us standup whereas

1077
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Steve Martin was his own [ __ ] thing

1078
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,880
to to for you to do what is essentially

1079
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,800
a performance piece that's interesting

1080
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,720
and I think that's one of the reasons

1081
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,040
that works so well is cuz like you're

1082
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,319
doing this very very tonally very

1083
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,720
different thing than you would normally

1084
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,560
do and I find that pretty yeah that's

1085
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,200
pretty great yeah I mean I think that it

1086
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,400
might be hard to get the rights to do

1087
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,400
that but it seems like a good TV show

1088
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,599
but I would talk to Brewer first yeah

1089
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,240
yeah yeah well now that I know that he

1090
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,800
did it I'm going to have to go into

1091
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,839
business with him yeah yeah yeah I love

1092
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,800
that idea that's great oh my God uh

1093
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,800
let's see so how how how are we doing on

1094
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,800
time I keep you

1095
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,040
okay so uh let's see if I can find a way

1096
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,440
to get us back to Mel Brooks positively

1097
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,720
probably not so let's go back real quick

1098
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,400
so after you're first introduced to Mel

1099
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,200
Brooks and Mel Brooks becomes a part of

1100
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,920
your life did it just make you see out

1101
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,559
more Mel Brooks or did it inspire you to

1102
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,319
look up certain Comics get certain

1103
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,319
albums anything or were you just finding

1104
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,599
what was funny or was it popular at the

1105
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:00,400
time well I I probably that that first

1106
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,720
album my first album was Steve Martin

1107
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,920
wild and crazy

1108
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,280
guy and then I think my dad got me this

1109
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,960
melbrooks thing pretty soon after and

1110
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,480
then I started collecting comedy albums

1111
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,160
there was this record store in uh White

1112
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,640
Plains New York that I used to it was a

1113
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,520
head shop with records and they had a

1114
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,960
they always had the new comedy album so

1115
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,400
I would buy you know you got your Weird

1116
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:26,200
Al Yankovic shirt on I would get Weird

1117
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,440
Al's albums and uh you know I got I have

1118
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,040
a lot of Bill Cosby albums all of

1119
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,359
carin's albums and so I've got boxes of

1120
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:37,000
comedy albums at my house and I think

1121
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:39,720
the idea of sitting and listening to

1122
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,440
Comedy is a really great way to ingest

1123
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,240
it you know because nowadays everybody

1124
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,359
has to watch it on TV and I think that I

1125
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,839
think it takes away from um getting lost

1126
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:53,000
in it as much because you're you know

1127
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,559
maybe too many of your senses are being

1128
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,440
being occupied I mean unless you're a

1129
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,040
physical comedian sure you know just

1130
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,280
listening to

1131
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,200
somebody is just the maybe it's the

1132
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,800
first way I was exposed to it because I

1133
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,720
didn't see standup comedy as a kid right

1134
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,720
I only knew it as listening to it and

1135
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,119
watching people do five minutes on The

1136
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,440
Tonight Show and that was a very

1137
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,400
different that felt different than what

1138
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,559
I was listening to on comedy albums

1139
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,960
which was much looser and people sounded

1140
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:22,920
like they were having more fun yeah and

1141
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:27,839
um so I guess I got indoctrinated to to

1142
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:29,680
Comedy by by listening first and the the

1143
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,160
feeling I had with my father because we

1144
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,200
listen to other comedy albums he loves

1145
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,920
Steve

1146
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,839
Martin and so I don't know that I sought

1147
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,680
out comedians like Mel Brooks but then

1148
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:41,319
when I was about uh 10 my father was a

1149
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,520
member of the Friars Club also in New

1150
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,200
York so he would bring me down and I

1151
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,720
would meet all the Comedians and they

1152
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,760
would and then my dad would take me out

1153
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,440
to see their shows so good we would go

1154
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,640
up to the cat skills and I remember

1155
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,440
going I remember going to the yakers

1156
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,680
Raceway one time which is this outdoor

1157
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,680
it was a [ __ ] Raceway a horse track

1158
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:03,319
and we go out and bro um

1159
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,920
um uh Freddy Roman is performing in the

1160
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:08,280
track but he's just got like this corner

1161
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,880
of the bleachers with a microphone set

1162
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,960
it was the weirdest set and Freddy of

1163
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,800
course is wearing a tuxedo it's 1:00 in

1164
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,880
the afternoon he's sweating and there's

1165
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,920
people scattered all over the place it

1166
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,119
was like the oxygen atom there was no

1167
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,520
there was no matter near itself and so

1168
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:29,680
he just went up there and to this day I

1169
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,119
took this lesson from him he he said how

1170
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,440
you doing folks thanks for coming out

1171
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,359
let's all get together come on let's

1172
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,720
move you guys hey lady in the blue blous

1173
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:38,960
you look beautiful not I love the joking

1174
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,760
around but getting them to all sit

1175
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,119
shoulder-to-shoulder in the stands

1176
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,760
together yeah and then he made them

1177
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,960
laugh and he killed and I realized like

1178
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,480
you your your job is not just to write

1179
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,400
and perform jokes your job is to put on

1180
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,480
a show make it a show [ __ ] produce it

1181
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,720
yourself you need to you know if you

1182
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,119
need to tell a the weight staff to shut

1183
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,079
the [ __ ] up if you need to throw

1184
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,480
somebody out if you need to you know

1185
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,640
tell it tell them to turn up the

1186
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,880
microphone like be present while you

1187
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,960
perform and be in control completely and

1188
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,000
so I I guess I got turned on to Comedy

1189
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,960
that was similar to to Mel Brooks in the

1190
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,079
sense that like these guys were Catskill

1191
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,000
Comedians and I just learned so many

1192
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,839
lessons from guys like Maly Lawrence and

1193
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,319
Dick Capri um you know from watching

1194
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:31,319
them in doing roasts at the Friars Club

1195
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:33,720

grabbed onto himself and that's how he

1202
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,160
fell in love you know I see and he

1203
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,640
stayed with himself and he lived with

1204
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,280
himself and was in love was he

1205
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,319
ostracized for being that way he was

1206
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,280

1207

was he shun was he shunned for that oh

1208
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,119
yes he was shunned because you know the

1209
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,319
Bible it says they shall not H spill thy

1210
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,119

00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,160
was fruitless and and subtracting you

1214
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:20,119
want to look it that's right do you have

1215
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,000
any of those albums no oh God those are

1216
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:24,240
they're so massively collectible but

1217
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,440
I've never I still have not heard one no

1218
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,079
I've never seen one I've got friends who

1219
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,800
own a bunch of them and collect them and

1220
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,920
you know we'll pay hundreds yeah they'll

1221
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,160
pay hundreds why didn't they make more

1222
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,000
just cuz they're for club members

1223
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,400
they're exclusive oh no [ __ ] yeah yeah

1224
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,640
and then you always wonder like were

1225
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,960
they nobody's afraid because they

1226
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,040
obviously said [ __ ] in front of a group

1227
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,160
of people but like I you know I lie I

1228
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,160
might have heard one that I feel like

1229
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,000
was I want to say it was a roast of like

1230
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,559
Humphrey Bogart of all people and Phil

1231
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,079
Silvers was in it and I love Phil

1232
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,400
Silvers silv and he is tearing into him

1233
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:58,160
with the most homophobic and again I

1234
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,920
know it's all in good fun but like I was

1235
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,440
like oh my God Sergeant Bilco what are

1236
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,800
you saying like I had no idea what these

1237
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,200
roasts were about and that that also has

1238
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,280
made me more interested to hear more of

1239
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,960
them but like yeah there you can I got I

1240
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,079
have friends who own a bunch of them

1241
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,720
because they're wealthier collectors

1242
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:16,000
than I am yeah I'm not wealthy at all so

1243
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,079
yeah I'm I'm curious to hear them so did

1244
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,599
you see a bunch of them live um yeah I

1245
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,800
would go when I was a kid my father

1246
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:25,599
would take me back when it was closed

1247
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,559
door mhm I want to say there was no

1248
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,359
women allowed probably

1249
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,240
the only one they let in for a long time

1250
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,480
was uh oh my God now I'm just totally

1251
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,240
blanking but uh there was no there was

1252
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,760
no press there was no recordings of it

1253
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,960
that I knew of okay so you know and they

1254
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,680
might not they've only might have

1255
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,079
recorded some of them then maybe it was

1256
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,960
just yeah I mean I guess they must have

1257
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,000
had some kind of Master tape but

1258
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,599
certainly not like the media coming in

1259
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,799
and recording it to play Clips or

1260
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,640
anything like that and and people let it

1261
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:56,960
out it was crazy the [ __ ] jokes and

1262
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,640
stuff that you know became taboo as as

1263
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,760
things evolved and then of course the

1264
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,200
Comedy Central roast took it down an

1265
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,880
even dirtier road but not not dirty in

1266
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,040
the same way right back then it was

1267
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:12,760
dirty in the sense that like uh you

1268
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,880
really were trying to uh top each other

1269
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,799
Y and ingratiate yourself to the person

1270
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,839
that you were roasting right as opposed

1271
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:21,440
to just I'm going to write the most

1272
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:23,160
hardcore jokes I can possibly pay 10

1273
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,400
other people to write for me yeah that's

1274
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,480
the other thing too is like you're being

1275
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,720
essentially cast to make jokes about a

1276
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,079
person you may never have met yeah and I

1277
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,559
feel like the friers club thing is at

1278
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,839
least we're all the same [ __ ] idiot

1279
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,680
we can all make the same jokes about

1280
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,480
each other that's where that you know

1281
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,480
camaraderie comes from which is why the

1282
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,440
comedy they're weird have you done any

1283
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,440
of the comedy I did the Chevy Chase

1284
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,119
roast Chevy CH okay which I mean talk

1285
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,720
about not knowing the guy you know he

1286
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,160
wouldn't even Shake our hands before the

1287
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,359
roast like people would go up and go to

1288
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,599
shake his hand and he would literally

1289
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,359
just turn he had sunglasses on and he

1290
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,920
turned his back to us while we roasted

1291
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:00,799
him God it was horrible oh that's rough

1292
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,960
yeah wow but you know the reason he

1293
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:05,520
didn't have anybody he knows roasting

1294
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,480
him is nobody would come yeah he has no

1295
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,680
friends yeah yeah this I don't know if

1296
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,880
it's different later in life but at that

1297
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:15,280
point which was probably around 2000 or

1298
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,240
so okay okay he had didn't have enough

1299
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,440
friends to pull together a uh de it's so

1300
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,160
weird you know he still got this

1301
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,480
reputation and then if you watch the

1302
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:26,799
National Lampoon documentary uh drunk

1303
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,280
Stone brilliant yeah it's so like his

1304
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:30,040
are kind of heartbreaking and kind of

1305
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,960
human and I'm like this is the first

1306
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,640
time I've seen you be a person in so

1307
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,280
long especially with all the [ __ ] like

1308
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,680
that he's been rumored to have done to

1309
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,359
Dan Harmon and stuff oh I didn't know

1310
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,920
that oh yeah because that's why there's

1311
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,920
so much [ __ ] on community so much

1312
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,720
clashing and he's I know that executive

1313
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,440
producers changed a few times during

1314
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,559
that show yeah and Dan Haron has played

1315
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,200
some of Chevy Chase's shitty voicemails

1316
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,400
to him which to me though what's funny

1317
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,359
though is when I listen to them I almost

1318
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,839
and again I he's got the personal

1319
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,200
experience I don't but I almost get a

1320
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:00,720
friar Club Vibe like I'm going to [ __ ]

1321
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,799
on you as hard as I can because I

1322
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,920
respect you but I also think there's a

1323
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:07,680
huge generation gap between Chevy Chase

1324
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,400
and Dan Harmon you're saying I can go

1325
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,880
online and find a voicemail of CH Chase

1326
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,040
yeah I think he's put them on on a

1327
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,319
podcast I I feel like they're on a

1328
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,160
that's somewhere yeah yeah yeah CH Chevy

1329
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:22,720
J is giving him just the Royal just the

1330
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,280
biggest amount of [ __ ] um so can I again

1331
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,880
I'm sorry I know we've we've gone off

1332
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,200
the rails just a little bit but you know

1333
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,640
we're still saying staying within your

1334
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,280
influences so apologies for my ignorance

1335
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,680
but your dad was a member of the was he

1336
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,200
a comic or he was a radio personality in

1337
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,079
New York he was one of the biggest radio

1338
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,040
guys in New York and so he was he was

1339
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,040
the token Irish guy at the friar club

1340
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,559
which is almost all Jewish and so they

1341
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,599
got a kick out of him because he'd come

1342
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,680
in and he he'd make uh the Jewish jokes

1343
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,240
with them and they'd make Irish jokes

1344
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,280
and then um on St Patrick's Day he would

1345
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,520
throw this big St Patrick's Day party at

1346
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,520
the club where he invited all of his

1347
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,079
friends that were mostly Irish sure but

1348
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,680
then all the old Jews would come

1349
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:02,319
wandering in and they'd have some Irish

1350
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,880
soda bread and listen to some music and

1351
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,319
watch some Step dancers and awesome and

1352
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,480
they loved it it became this mixing of

1353
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,960
Two Worlds and so he ended up becoming

1354
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,200
on he was on the board and then he was

1355
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,280
the Scribe which is on the you know

1356
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,799
which is an elected office at the club

1357
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:21,319
um and so he used to bring me bring me

1358
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:25,559
to the club a lot I watched the OJ Chase

1359
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:28,400
there really I saw the um the miracle

1360
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,839
hockey team the Olympics in was it

1361
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,799
1976 okay or 80 I think it might have

1362
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,680
been 80 and um yeah so it's a very

1363
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:38,599
special place in my family's that's so

1364
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,000
cool life and then when he died they

1365
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:41,680
they had a golf tournament that was a

1366
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,799
fundraiser and they named it the Bob F

1367
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,520
Simmons uh golf tournament that's

1368
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:47,920
awesome and they've had it going for

1369
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,079
years and then they wrapped it up a few

1370
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,359
years ago so apologies for my appalling

1371
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,839

radio so now I want to know more I'm

1381
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,960
always fascinated with radio so what

1382
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:22,520
kind of radio it was AM radio back when

1383
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,599
am was King and it was I tell you what

1384
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,240
not that different than a podcast he

1385
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,319
would he would get on he'd shoot the

1386
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,160
[ __ ] he' talk about my mom and us and he

1387
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:32,920
talk about what's going on in the news

1388
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,040
and he bring on guests mayor cot used to

1389
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,680
call in every single morning awesome and

1390
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,119
he would have on um you know Sinatra

1391
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,839
would come in sometimes and it was very

1392
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,200
uh it was very New York you know he's

1393
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:48,040
he's a bronx Irish guy and he just

1394
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,480
embodied a lot of what the what New York

1395
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,880
was about but he was a bleeding heart

1396
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:57,400
liberal and so he would get into it with

1397
00:53:51,880 --> 00:54:00,640
his Republican counterparts yeah and uh

1398
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,440
and so it was it was like uh people got

1399
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:07,200
to know him yeah and that's so cool and

1400
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,000
they tuned in to hear his life so that

1401
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,960
was obviously a huge influence on me and

1402
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,559
I didn't know it would be because I did

1403
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,640
just standup comedy for the first you

1404
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:19,119
know 20 years of my career and it's only

1405
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,160
in the last six six or so that I started

1406
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,559
doing ra you know doing radio on a

1407
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,880
podcast and it's kind of like wow was I

1408
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,280
supposed to have started this a long

1409
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,319
time ago right that's amazing yeah are

1410
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,799
there archives out there of your dad's

1411
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,839
stuff up on the Shelf there's a bunch um

1412
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:37,760
but no I don't think I don't know that

1413
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,160
you can find them online maybe I should

1414
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,440
I should make a project out of putting

1415
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,799
his stuff up online I don't know how

1416
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,440
many people would really care at this

1417
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:46,440
point but for the people that would yeah

1418
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,240
I think it would be really nice well as

1419
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,640
as as a at least amateur archist myself

1420
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,280
it's I mostly just do it to do it I want

1421
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,000
it to be there right with the option and

1422
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,839
the understanding that maybe nobody will

1423
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,319
give a

1424
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:01,599
[ __ ] but I I don't know for me it's the

1425
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:03,640
project in and of itself is worth it I

1426
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,480
just I would be fascinated so many hours

1427
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,000
to go through and some of it's unreal to

1428
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,200
real yeah that's the hard part

1429
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,520
especially if that [ __ ] starts to fall

1430
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,319
apart but if you need somebody I I know

1431
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,200
fire sign theaters

1432
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:18,319
archists archivist he has access to

1433
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,000
every possible thing that yes yeah so

1434
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,799
let me know if you need anything um okay

1435
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,200
so let's let's this again no Segways no

1436
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:28,160
if you're gonna talk about segs are for

1437
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,359
[ __ ] thank you thank you so much talk

1438
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,400
yeah if you're G to recommend this album

1439
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,880
I mean I think I know what you're gonna

1440
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,720
say but let's say somebody either

1441
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,319
doesn't know anything about Mel Brooks

1442
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,680
or only knows Latter Day Mel Brooks

1443
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,920
let's say they only know the producers

1444
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,559
musical movie uh what's a good reason to

1445
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:48,599
listen to this album

1446
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:51,480
um I guess again I got to go back to the

1447
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:55,119
relationship between him and Carl Riner

1448
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:58,799
um I think you Marvel at his quickness

1449
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:01,920
and his references is but it's like we

1450
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:04,280
all wish we had a friend that we could

1451
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,480
talk like this with yeah and I think

1452
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,400
that's the number one thing and it's

1453
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,400
like to to me to sit down and listen to

1454
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,280
this is it's just a different experience

1455
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,200
that young people don't get just make

1456
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,400
them sit down in a room and just listen

1457
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,799
to this album and it's almost like

1458
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,440
they're going to experience something in

1459
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,280
life that they never have before because

1460
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,559
they're so used to seeing things

1461
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,559
visually and you think of in the old

1462
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,280
days people sitting around a radio and

1463
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,440
it really develops Community you look at

1464
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,280
each other yeah even more so that in a

1465
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,640
comedy club your eyes are on the

1466
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,839
performer you may glance at each other

1467
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,720
sidewards once in a while like that's

1468
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:39,680
you

1469
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,440
honey but when you're when you're

1470
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,880
listening to it like we would play

1471
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,319
backham and you you look at each other a

1472
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,760
lot while you're listening yeah and you

1473
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,359
really connect on it and it's very

1474
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,640
meaningful it's very personal and it's

1475
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:52,960
almost like you're sitting in a room

1476
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,319
with some friends that are making you

1477
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,039
laugh yeah Ah that's perfect that kind

1478
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:58,880

several years the important part though

1575
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,319
is that while we're close friends we

1576
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,920
found a bond when we discovered that we

1577
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:43,079
both love the greatest sitcom of the 9s

1578
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,640
