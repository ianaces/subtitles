30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,560
respect like each joke does exist unto

31
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,040
itself in its own particularity um on

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,280
another deeper level they all comprise

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,959
like a greater hole

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,200
um and and and you're not capable of you

35
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,519
know appreciating what's truly hilarious

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,280
about any any particular bit until we've

37
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,080
gotten to the end and you've the youve

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,480
the context

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,920
um and I'm sorry I'm sorry like I know

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,800
that you come to a comedy show uh

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:40,720
expecting to laugh um and enjoy

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,720
yourselves U but life isn't fair

43
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,519
um I I feel like this is going to be one

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,680
of those shows where you leave uh

45
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,920
feeling like [ __ ] um but they but then

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
get that slight little pickme up when

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,640
you realize that no one from the show is

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,640
actually on your subway car home

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
um cuz it's not easy I don't know I feel

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,400
like the fact that you're out there and

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,319
I'm here like we are are unable to

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
relate I uh I remember before I ever did

53
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,640
standup whenever I was out in the

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
audience the only thing going through my

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,200
head the entire time was you know like I

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,200
I can do better than this [ __ ]

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,480
um no but really this is what I'm hoping

58
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,040
will be a very limited edition series of

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,280
my standup uh entitled jokes that I

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,799
wrote last night while awake at 400 in

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,840
the morning um on account of not being

62
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,360
able to sleep for fear of the way that

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
my life is unfolding

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,640
um is dedicated to my mother

65
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,680
um but she and I have a very strain

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,760
relationship um she says all she's ever

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,799
wanted is for me to to to be happy um

68
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,799
All I've Ever Wanted uh is to be loved

69
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,680
and respected um and it's a real

70
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,680
stalemate

71
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,319
um no but really uh the last time the

72
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,760
last time she she I went out for dinner

73
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,400
the bill came in and and she said

74
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,280
$67 was it worth

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,560
it and I said like normally I like to do

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,280
what I can to try not to put a dollar

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:29,600
value um on the time that we spend

78
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:32,479
together uh but if I'm forced to um the

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,479
this was a very expensive

80
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,160
meal no my mother's doing quite well the

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,280
last time I went home I discovered that

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
she recently renovated my room into a

83
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,380
place where a kid would have been happy

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,720
growing up

85
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,160
[Applause]

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,680
um it wasn't easy it wasn't easy my

87
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,919
father was a

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,160
little violent um I I remember I recall

89
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,600
as a as as a kid telling my mom one day

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:01,560
when I grow big enough uh he's going to

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,560
beat the [ __ ] out of only you um

92
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,120
[Music]

93
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,080
I I remember though telling um my

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,199
telling my sister I think the one thing

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,240
preventing me from killing myself uh is

96
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,400
the fear of what it might do to the

97
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,919
family um and and she said David you

98
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,479
can't continue to live your life with

99
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,160
respect to what you think will make

100
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,160
other people happy

101
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,360
um so few ever actually recognized that

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,039
as a joke

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,600
um yet yet no one ever intervenes you

104
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,120
know um I remember the last my my my

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,840
mother what happens after we die and she

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,840
said Daddy Goes to Jail

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,880
um but we wanted to disclose like to

108
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,440
reveal to my sister the fact of her

109
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,000
adoption um but in the way sort of least

110
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,720
traumatic as possible uh so we we let

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,919
her know in the midst of a sort of

112
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,919
collective family sexual assault

113
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,960
um you don't realize it right now but

114
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,800
that was your favorite joke of the

115
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,800
evening

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,639
um no years you know I mean like now now

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,440
now you may not see what's so funny um

118
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,440
but ye years from now you may look back

119
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,720
on this entire evening as a whole you

120
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,800
know and laugh and that's really the

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,000
essence of Comedy I feel right

122
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,199
there they say though a more senior

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,400
comic has told me that you have to love

124
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,400
your

125
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,720
audience but but I

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
think there has to be a way around that

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,039
um Love is something that develops over

128
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,720
time you know possibly at the end of the

129
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,840
at the end end of the set but uh no

130
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,680
really though if you're not enjoying

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,599
yourselves this evening uh you've only

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,400
yourself to blame

133
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,759
um this is your life uh you know and and

134
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,960
and whether you're at a comedy show or

135
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,479
you're or you're you're making love

136
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,879
you're on your way to work you have to

137
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,160
take control and responsibility for your

138
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,520
experience of it you know like uh like

139
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm not enjoying

140
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,280
myself but but who would I be to blame

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,280
you you

142
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,000
know like I don't think

143
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,960
Jesus I don't think Jesus was ever like

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,960
oh I've never been to Paris know

145
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,440
like no probably like a very rich

146
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
internal life you

147
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,720
know but really though all these years I

148
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,680
done stand up for myself cuz I you know

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,280
for for me cuz I wanted to but now I

150
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,639
realize that there is no self the self

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,280
doesn't exist there's only relation um

152
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,520
between me and you with respect to why

153
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,440
we're here and what we want in

154
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:06,080
particular time and place and so for me

155
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:09,280
you are the necessary evil um which

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,080
allows me to do what I want which is to

157
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,479
tell

158
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,639
jokes but the terrible thing is is that

159
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,560
I can't even tell the jokes that I want

160
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:24,599
to tell because you don't understand

161
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,599
comedy the way that I know

162
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,240
it no but really thank you for being

163
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,240
here uh

164
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,240
obviously obviously without an audience

165
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,680
it' be impossible for me to to share

166
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,519
with the world uh through my standup

167
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,640
just how much I I dislike doing this

168
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,000
um because all these young Comics all

169
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,959
these very young Comics always make so

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,399
so angry I I I can't help but feel like

171
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,240
if you know if only ID started like 10

172
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,200
years earlier by now I could be done

173
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,200
with the whole [ __ ] thing

174
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,160
already

175
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,360
but I hope everyone's been having like a

176
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,000
nice break as of I um my friend held a

177
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,600
little get together to celebrate the

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,440
birth of work child and I guess it was

179
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,000
inappropriate but at the time looking at

180
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:20,200
that beautiful new baby all I could

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,200
think to myself was this life to shall

182
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,959
die and I told my friends how I felt and

183
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,800
they said well that's what makes its

184
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:28,120
life so valuable and I said no that's

185
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,120
what makes its life such a

186
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
waste

187
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,440
and while they all gave me looks of

188
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,040
understanding I don't think any of them

189
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,720
truly appreciated what I meant because

190
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,040
none of them bothered to pull the baby

191
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,040
from the

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,120
pool I remember though my girlfriend was

193
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,680
pregnant and uh she wanted to keep the

194
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,040
kid but I just wasn't ready to be a

195
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,440
father um and she said when we leave

196
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,519
this world don't you want there to

197
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
remain something behind that's a part of

198
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,160
the two of us and the symbol of the love

199
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,000
we have have for each other and I said

200
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,519
of course but I'm just not ready to be a

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,839
father and so we compromised uh we went

202
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:15,160
to this Artisans workshop and and we

203
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,240
crafted with our very own hands this mug

204
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,240
out

205
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,279
of out of clay

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,760
um and we and we signed it and

207
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,399
everything

208
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,040
uh and now that's uh where we keep the

209
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,040
aborted fetus um

210
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,760
sadly though you know the stresses of

211
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,600
the time were so great it led to our

212
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,600
eventual breakup um and so now I only

213
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,760
have access to The Mug on Mondays

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,839
Wednesdays Fridays

215
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,680
and every other

216
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,639
Saturday often times where there can be

217
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,440
women in the audience who've actually

218
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,880
had a miscarriage uh who could have

219
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,800
difficulty appreciating the humor um

220
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,959
it's almost as if uh if some

221
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,959
something died inside of

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,519
them I'm sorry this is the Persona with

223
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,880
which I'm forced to continue

224
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
um my girlfriend though absolutely

225
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,079
refuses to use any form of birth control

226
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,800
uh whatsoever and it's really sort of

227
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,040
changed my world to know that now each

228
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,079
time I have sex there's the real

229
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:32,639
possibility of me bringing about not

230
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,639
only a brand new life but also a single

231
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,440
mother no I know that there can be some

232
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,480
uh some women who find that joke to be

233
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,000
slightly misogynistic

234
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,880
um but then again you know your gender

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,680
really isn't known for its sense of

236
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,680
humor

237
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,600
um but I'm a good person I'm a good

238
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,519
person I I just have no jokes to

239
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,399
illustrate the fact

240
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
um I have a I have a friend though he's

241
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,279
in lots of bands and he says the way it

242
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,440
works is that all Comics want be

243
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,320
musicians and and all musicians want to

244
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,399
be

245
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,720
comics and it just makes me so angry I'm

246
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,839
like why would I want to be anyone who

247
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,839
wants to be a

248
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,920
comic by the privilege though this year

249
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,279
of doing my first set at a music f

250
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,760
festival and afterwards like we had a

251
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,920
car ride home back to Montreal 13 hours

252
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,480
straight overnight with these four

253
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,079
musicians and the whole way we had this

254
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,600
very sort of esoteric uh philosophical

255
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,480
conversation as to the nature of Art and

256
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,880
I came to think you know why comedy why

257
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,720
am I a comic why do I tell jokes and so

258
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,440
so basically like we're only here to be

259
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,199
happy really and so for me what's

260
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,639
funniest is when we're not

261
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,399
happy um and it just what happens to be

262
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,680
the case that just intuitively I I tend

263
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,639
to subvert for myself any happy moment

264
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,360
which which begins you know I see what's

265
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,639
terrible in it and even for the stage

266
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,240
now doing standup I look for what's

267
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,480
awful in every moment so my life is a

268
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,959
series of like unhappy unhappy instances

269
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,560
and that's why jokes that's why I'm a

270
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,680
comic

271
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,680
um and then so I asked the musician I

272
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,399
was like why music like why are why do

273
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,560
you why why music and he's like

274
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,360
well he's like when I'm like actively

275
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,320
listening to music

276
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,399
or like writing or playing

277
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,199
it it's like that's when I'm closest to

278
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,839
the

279
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:44,320
universal that's when I'm

280
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,320
one with the

281
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,800
universe and I was like

282
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,639
[Music]

283
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:57,759
oh you can go [ __ ] yourself like [ __ ]

284
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:00,240
you [ __ ] you [ __ ]

285
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,519
you

286
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,160
I don't know no one asked for this no

287
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,880
one asked for this

288
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,560
life not it takes up all lot lot most

289
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,120
lots of my time and my money and I think

290
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,079
that I I don't think I'm getting back

291
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:18,480
what I put into it but that's

292
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:18,480
uh but if I if I had to own a

293
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:27,680
slave if I had to own a slave I I think

294
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:30,600
it would be John col train

295
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,880
um

296
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,360
and if I had to own a second slave like

297
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,959
if I had to own a second slave I think

298
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,279
it would be thonus

299
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,360
monk um although just a small part of me

300
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,000
can't help it feel that perhaps what

301
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,480
with all the slaving away all day uh it

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,600
would affect their music just a little

303
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,839
bit you

304
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,120
know I think I

305
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,519
can I think that I can tell that joke

306
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,880
though because I'm a comic

307
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,519
um and I don't own I don't own anything

308
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,519
so

309
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,839
uh I was going through um I was going

310
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,639
through a really rough time last year

311
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:13,000
and I didn't know whether I could go on

312
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:16,600
um and so for the first time ever I

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,639
prayed uh and I asked God for the

314
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,000
strength and the courage to

315
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,199
continue and he said

316
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,199
uh uh

317
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,279
no

318
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm just tired of seeing seeing blood in

319
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,199
my urine I think that's

320
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,920
yeah there's a woman that I know she's

321
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,600
morbidly obese and uh not a single time

322
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,279
throughout her entire pregnancy did she

323
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,279
receive a

324
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,160
congratulations and she thinks it's

325
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,800
because people were afraid to confuse

326
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,639
her possible being with with child for

327
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:59,600
what may in fact he have been just yet

328
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:04,000
another fold of fat um whereas in

329
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,000
actuality no one was happy to see her

330
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,759
procreating no the one thing I won't

331
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,360
make fun of in my stand up is the plate

332
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,480
of the fat and obese um you know it

333
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,480
really is a genetic Lottery uh the the

334
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,560
way that I see it um you know I was

335
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,519
simply fortunate enough to to have been

336
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,519
born with a sense of

337
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,040
Shame but you always hear like how this

338
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,480
sort of like distorted feminine ideal of

339
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,720
beauty creates all these like anxieties

340
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,279
and eating disorders and women um which

341
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,759
is terrible uh but no one ever talks

342
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:47,000
about how difficult it is for me to find

343
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:47,000
a girl whom I can bring myself to [ __ ]

344
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,319
um but I'm over my whole sort of younger

345
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,680
girl phase I've simply arrived at that

346
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,000
level of maturity where I where I

347
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,600
realize uh what's truly satisfying is

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,790
you know the complete domination of the

349
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:07,600
will of an equal

350
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:11,000
[Laughter]

351
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,240
um in 1972 though John lenon and Yoko

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Ono released to sort of an you know

353
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,919
understandably apprehensive audience um

354
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,679
the song Woman is the [ __ ] of the

355
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,079
world uh to you know you know talk about

356
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,760
the second class status and um you know

357
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,480
leaders of African-American communities

358
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,960
were quite upset saying this is a slap

359
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,600
in the face and culture

360
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
sensitive um so John and Yoko they sort

361
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,480
of like they they they they went back

362
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,559
and they re-released the song under a

363
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,679
second title uh [ __ ] is the [ __ ] of

364
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,679
the

365
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,360
world but you know but ethics uh which

366
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,039
is what I think is the essence of Comedy

367
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,080
is quite ambiguous uh whereas rules of

368
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,799
grammar are quite clear-cut

369
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,600
um for instance if a transgendered

370
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,679
person gets gets mad at you for using

371
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,960
the wrong pronoun it's it's actually

372
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:09,400
permissible for you to tell him or her

373
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,400
to go [ __ ]

374
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,760
themselves I've been tutoring this kid

375
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,960
though is not doing very well at school

376
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,320
he's in grade four uh but he reads at a

377
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:24,120
grade 2 literacy level and he's got uh a

378
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:27,000
bad attitude to boot um the last

379
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,240
time the last time I I I went in to see

380
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,799
him he told me that my hair was kind of

381
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,799
messy and I said so what um you can't

382
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:45,039
read no but really like I was doing you

383
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,159
know I was in the states for a while

384
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,840
doing stand up there and the thing with

385
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,520
the states is like the word like the

386
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,000
word [ __ ] is so common it's it's all

387
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:57,039
over especially in uh in rap music I

388
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,440
find uh although I can understand it I

389
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,880
guess in one sense because it's a word

390
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,320
that like Rhymes so easily

391
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,480
uh and it has this particular sort of

392
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,440
meter to it which also is you know it's

393
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,679
good to it works

394
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,919
and I guess what I'm trying to say is

395
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,900
that like these people don't want to

396
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:23,610
work hard

397
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,610
[Laughter]

398
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,640
um

399
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,240
but but it's contextual you know it's a

400
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,400
word like [ __ ] like what it depends

401
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,720
how you're using it you know like for

402
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:39,200
some people are so reluctant to

403
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,200
like like my girlfriend

404
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,679
um it was our it was our safe word

405
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,300
[Music]

406
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,240
um that's that's how she

407
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
died

408
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,799
[Music]

409
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,840
but it's all pretense right like if I

410
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,000
say like uh if I say like I like [ __ ]

411
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,559
little

412
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,840
boys

413
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,760
but I don't love

414
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,400
it then you don't know where on the

415
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,559
Spectrum it may

416
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,960
lie no but really though for the first

417
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,960
time ever a girl asked me to to like you

418
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,720
know ejaculate over her face and uh

419
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,480
like I you know it isn't anything I've

420
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,960
ever had any interest in doing um but I

421
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,039
said like if if this is something that

422
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,640
you

423
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:42,960
enjoy I'm H I'm happy to oblige uh but

424
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,520
perhaps if while it's happening you

425
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,120
could please explain to me just what it

426
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,440
is about this that you like uh then at

427
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,679
least I could get something out of the

428
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,679
whole

429
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,000
experience all I'm saying is

430
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,640
that personal relationship can be quite

431
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,120
difficult um I remember this guy went

432
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,600
school for years he was complete wreck

433
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,960
after his girlfriend left him he had no

434
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,360
idea what had happened and I remember uh

435
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,000
between his sobbing he softly said to me

436
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,240
he said David as my only friend uh tell

437
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,240
me the

438
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:20,120
truth and I said

439
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,120
uh I'm I'm not your friend

440
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,120
um but they say that it's out of the

441
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,120
profoundest human suffering that emerges

442
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,400
the greatest communic achievement and I

443
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,600
think that's true in personally I you

444
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,919
know that's why I think it's so tragic

445
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,120
about the the death camps

446
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,400
um when you think of all the incredible

447
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,400
jokes you must have lost you

448
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,919
know but if there's one thing that I've

449
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,559
learned uh throughout all my years of

450
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:50,400
standup it's that no one likes this next

451
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,400
joke

452
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,720
um because I'm an adherent of the sort

453
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,919
of classically modern historical notion

454
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,720
of stand up comedy uh According to which

455
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,240
there's sort of an implicit uh

456
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,520
discernable directional progress uh to

457
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,600
the unfolding of joke telling over time

458
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,320
um it just so happens that we're at what

459
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,679
one may conceive of as sort of like the

460
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,000
you know like sort of like the Communist

461
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:22,400
totalitarian stage uh and I know that

462
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,679
it's not easy um but I promise you that

463
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:31,320
if you stick with me uh in only two

464
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,320
generations time uh perfect hilarity for

465
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,000
everyone will will history vindicate

466
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,360
that

467
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,799
joke ought it to because I I think that

468
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,000
if you're only asking how much you know

469
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:46,159
did you laugh then you're really missing

470
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,159
the bigger picture

471
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,880
um I was telling the one of my harder

472
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,080
jokes on evening about the the the rape

473
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,440
and murder of this woman and after my

474
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,760
set a man from the audience came up to

475
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,080
me and said you know uh I think you

476
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,880
ought to be aware of the fact that in

477
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,520
real life my wife wife was actually

478
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,320
raped and

479
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,000
murdered and he told me this and I had

480
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,720
one of those moments where things sort

481
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,279
of stand still and you start to see

482
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,320
things

483
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:17,720
differently and when I finally gathered

484
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,200
a hold of myself I apologized to the man

485
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,200
for being so incredibly Thoughtless and

486
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,880
told him that from now on uh you can be

487
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,880
the one to tell the

488
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
joke

489
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,440
but they tell me they say David there's

490
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,120
nothing at all funny about sexual

491
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,760
assault and I say I

492
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:47,360
know um that's

493
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
not why I do

494
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,440
it I've been thinking quite a bit though

495
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,240
recently about circumcision um um it was

496
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,919
Abraham at least according to the Bible

497
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,159
who's the first person to be circumcised

498
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:08,000
in fact he circumcised himself uh what

499
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,320
happened at least according to the Bible

500
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,120
is that God spoke to him and said this

501
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,159
shall be our covenant between me and you

502
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,440
respect to all of your progeny

503
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,480
throughout the ages and uh it's very

504
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,120
strange to me because like God could

505
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,720
have chosen anything to be the

506
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,799
Covenant but this is what

507
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,320
wanted so it's like God is vast and

508
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,320
infinite unknowable and complex and all

509
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,000
these things the one thing that we can

510
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,480
say for certain is that God really does

511
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,480
like circumcised

512
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,159
penises and I'm no Theologian and and I

513
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,360
don't know if like Angels on the head of

514
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,399
a pin um but apparently on a good day

515
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,520
God could fit like four of them in his

516
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:56,720
mouth at once

517
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,760
um and if NRA is to be believed that's

518
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,760
actually how he died

519
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,600
um I just like the image of God sitting

520
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,120
there with all these dicks in his mouth

521
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,120
thinking oh it's good to be God you

522
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,679
know I think it was anel or Augustine uh

523
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,399
who asked whether God could shove so

524
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,039
many [ __ ] into his mouth that it would

525
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:24,159
be too many [ __ ] for God uh and

526
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,880
obviously the answer is no um which was

527
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,640
decided uh during Vatican 2 um when

528
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,039
Church Council got together to reconcile

529
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,039
sort of modernity and and

530
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,880
Doctrine no but NRA actually has this

531
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,840
notion of eternal return which is that

532
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,559
if time and space are infinite it's not

533
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,120
that any Universe which can possibly

534
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:46,360
exist will come about uh a single time

535
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,399
but rather it will recur an infinite

536
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,399
number of

537
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:53,880
times and this notion sort of came to

538
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:57,000
mind once uh while in the midst of

539
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,039
masturbating um and the idea that there

540
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,120
could be an infinite number of universes

541
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:06,760
comprised solely of one person having

542
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,760
this thought while

543
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,360
masturbating that was my worst

544
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,360
masturbation session

545
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,120
ever there's this comic that I know

546
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,360
though who

547
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,880
uh he was I guess he was like you know

548
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,720
molested as a kid um and every single

549
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,240
all all he talks about on stage is how

550
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,120
he was sexually abused and my heart was

551
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,200
like oh like like perhaps like if only

552
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:37,360
you hadn't been like sexually abused as

553
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,480
a kid today you might understand how to

554
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,480
tell a [ __ ]

555
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,640
joke it's not that I rever

556
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,080
pedophiles

557
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,880
uh but just a little part of me just

558
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,320
reveres them just a little bit uh

559
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,720
because to my mind mind it's it's

560
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,760
unimaginable that they are incapable of

561
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,279
recognizing the incredible potential

562
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,080
harm that they're doing possibly ruining

563
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:11,919
a life for something that they

564
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,960
love cuz I know that I have never felt a

565
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,960
love like that

566
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,799
before and I don't think that I ever

567
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,039
will um and like I don't want to touch a

568
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:25,200
kid

569
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,120
um but like if I loved standup so much

570
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,919
that in order to do it I would go

571
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,080
through a

572
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,080
kid I think that would be a beautiful

573
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,919
thing I think though that everyone

574
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,679
should touch a kid at least a single

575
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,600
time

576
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,720
um I'm not saying it would make you look

577
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,720
a good person or good citizen but you

578
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,720
only go around once and you really don't

579
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,279
know what you like until you try it uh

580
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,960
especially in the bedroom

581
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,120
um and you know like social Ms evolve

582
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,679
and and change and and and and and and

583
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,519
laws 65 5 years ago there no voting

584
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,799
rights for black people right so like

585
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:05,559
who knows what 3 weeks from now will be

586
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,559
a be able to

587
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,960
touch oftentimes after a set some the

588
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,240
audence come up to me and say I really

589
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,440
didn't appreciate the things that you

590
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,279
said on stage uh but then you know other

591
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,279
times uh sexual predators will

592
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,760
approach and say you you really struck a

593
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:29,440
cord

594
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,440
uh so I guess it balances out you know

595
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,519
why why is it always though like only

596
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,120
the absolute sort of objectively worst

597
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:41,120
societies that don't recognize cultural

598
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,000
relativism that's that's normally the

599
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,000
big Applause break number right there

600
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,200
but like this friend of mine he wanted

601
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,919
to volunteer in Africa but not with some

602
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,720
sort of Western organization with its

603
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,080
own Imperial agenda for the continent

604
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,000
and uh but with like a local group so

605
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,440
for six months he ended up with the uh

606
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,110
the sudes uh government um helping to to

607
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:16,360
to to rape and murder darans

608
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:18,640
[Laughter]

609
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,600
um but I've but I've recently I don't

610
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,679
know I've recently sort of been on the

611
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,440
lookout for some expad Sudanese chicks

612
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,480
um it's not that I find their slender

613
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,600
faces or cool dark complexions to be

614
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,000
especially attractive it's just that I

615
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,360
think could be a lot less pressure and

616
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,360
work to date a girl who doesn't have a

617
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,360
clitoris I actually told that Joo the

618
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,760
evening when we were working over at the

619
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,000
women's shelter

620
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,000
um but it didn't go over very well at

621
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,039
all

622
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,039
I I I [ __ ] up the timing and

623
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,279
everything but if you're only sort of

624
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,120
like think thinking about these jokes

625
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,480
and laughing to yourself and not out

626
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,919
loud that I can't see the backs of your

627
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,720
mouths which is why I do this uh I feel

628
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:12,960
like [ __ ] the audience in the face is

629
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,960
like the final taboo of standup somehow

630
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,640
so a lot of a lot of people were quite

631
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,760
outraged when the director uh Roman

632
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,880
palansky pleaded guilty to what was

633
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,559
essentially the rape of a miner um but I

634
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,559
think we forgetting that he was also a

635
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:33,679
holocaust suror um because in my mind

636
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:37,039
the two things sort of even out uh the

637
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:41,519
way that I see it that 13-year-old girl

638
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,519
was essentially just his

639
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,279
Palestine as a side note um I actually

640
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,399
came up with that uh joke one evening

641
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,960
after someone challenged me to write

642
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:59,240
something that would offend Jews women

643
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,240
uh and fans of Chinatown um

644
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,840
this is a fine line that we didn't

645
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,039
comedy tragedy I agree personally I've

646
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,480
never been quite exactly sure where I

647
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,159
stand on the issue of

648
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,799
genocide um because on the one hand unly

649
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:19,480
tragic uh but on the other hand

650
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,480
undeniably

651
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:28,399
funny I guess it's just one of

652
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,279
those things where you really had to be

653
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,279
there

654
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,720
um my grandfather though was one of the

655
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,799
few uh lucky members of his generation

656
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,200
to grow up Jewish in Europe and avoid

657
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,480
the horrors of the Holocaust uh

658
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,159
thankfully uh several months before the

659
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,650
war broke out he was beaten to death in

660
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,910
a

661
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,910
[Laughter]

662
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,960
pom

663
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,919
no but there still is the uncomfortable

664
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,919
lingering question as to why if the Jews

665
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,840
as they did so outnumber the Nazis at

666
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:11,559
the camps why didn't they fight back um

667
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,559
you obviously I don't know uh but what I

668
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:16,679
can say is that we Jews do pride

669
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,000
ourselves on what we like to believe is

670
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,360
our distinctly dark self-deprecating

671
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,519
sense of

672
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,880
humor and in fact today it is nice to

673
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,919
have for ourselves as a source of

674
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,240
material um

675
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,639
basically the greatest human suffering

676
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,639
in living

677
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:35,080
memory and yeah you know like while it

678
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:38,120
would have been nice to have had a full

679
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,840
set of of grandparents um I simply

680
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,880
cannot tell you to just what an extent I

681
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,880
respect their commitment to the

682
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,120
joke when the Nazis though they did some

683
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:54,440
unconscionable things they actually

684
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,400
forced the Jews to work the

685
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:02,559
crematoria on Saturdays

686
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:05,600
[Laughter]

687
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:09,240
that's our that's our day of rest uh

688
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,240
it's it's an a front to God

689
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,159
um I know that people like oh like too

690
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,760
soon too soon and like yeah yeah okay

691
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,760
but like one more year you know

692
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,360
so there's this new field of Academia

693
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,000
though which asks uh what would have

694
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,559
happened had decisive moments in history

695
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,919
turned out differently and

696
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:36,080
apparently had Hitler won the war um

697
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:40,919
people wouldn't get so [ __ ] upset

698
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,919
when I tell a holocaust

699
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,759
[Music]

700
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,759
[Applause]

701
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,200
joke I think the big difference though

702
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:54,039
between the Holocaust and the Armenian

703
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,279
Genocide of of 19 sort of 14 to 18 is

704
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:59,480
that why there were still a few crazy

705
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:03,440
holocausts is out there The Armenian

706
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,440
Genocide never happened

707
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:12,159
um if I may though I'd like to read to

708
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:16,679
you my favorite passage from the Bible

709
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:19,560
um it's about menstration um it goes as

710
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,639
follows um when a woman has a discharge

711
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,480
of blood which is her regular discharge

712
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,359
from her body she shall be in her

713
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,599
impurity for seven days and whoever

714
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,040
touches her shall be unclean and

715
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:29,919
everything upon which she lies during

716
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,119
her impurity will be unclean everything

717
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,679
also upon which she sits shall be

718
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,000
unclean and whoever touches her bed

719
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,240
shall wash his clothes whoever touches

720
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,040
anything upon which she sits shall wash

721
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,320
his clothes whether it is a bed or

722
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,879
anything upon which she sits and goes on

723
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,520
and on and on and on and that there is

724
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,040
actually um from a brief period after

725
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,040
the destruction of the second temple um

726
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,040
when for a a brief while God was

727
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,200
thinking of just giving it all up and

728
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,119
instead going into the laundering

729
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,119
business

730
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,879
um

731
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,880
for the first time ever though I know

732
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,640
it's like a very sort of like cliche

733
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,880
premise but I actually lost a condom

734
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:19,119
inside of a girl um she's about sort of

735
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:22,000
like 55 with shoulder length brown hair

736
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,960
um so if

737
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,040
anyone happens to find it uh you can

738
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:32,440
talk to ram uh he has my contact info

739
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,599
and no questions asked you

740
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,920
know as a man though it's one of my

741
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,040
great Pleasures in life to pee uh

742
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,320
standing

743
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:48,359
up and uh over a sitting down woman

744
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,480
um and into the mouth of another sitting

745
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,079
down

746
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,920
woman obviously it would be so much you

747
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,520
know greater to pee into the mouth of a

748
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,960
standing up woman standing

749
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,760
being so Majestic um but I can no longer

750
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,560
achat the stream

751
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,440
um I think though that in order to be

752
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,000
penetrated I would really have to feel

753
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,960
like this guy is so

754
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,520
masterful I don't know I just feel like

755
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,119
it's a really like giving up of oneself

756
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,119
but I don't think that I'm willing to to

757
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,960
sort of concede that I feel that I don't

758
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,079
know

759
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,000
like like my uncle for instance um he

760
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,240
bought a he he bought a cottage recently

761
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,960
and it's beautiful it's the first one in

762
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,560
our family it's like two stories and

763
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,160
it's newly finished it's lovely and I

764
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,560
remember the first time I saw it just

765
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,000
thinking like oh like if I could have

766
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,079
this

767
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,599
life I would let you [ __ ] me however you

768
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,920
want whenever you

769
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,400
want but still I couldn't be like no

770
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,680
like just cuz I can't afford a cottage

771
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,480
at this point in my life it doesn't mean

772
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,160
I've made all my decisions wrong I have

773
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,920
my Pleasures you

774
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,359
know but the strangest thing was was to

775
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,520
to recognize that the one thing

776
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,359
preventing me from allowing my uncle to

777
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,960
[ __ ]

778
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,960
me was my low

779
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,160
self-esteem I remember I was in New York

780
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,079
happened to be over the the Gay Pride

781
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,640
weekend um or The Pride weekend and

782
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,000
there were all these you know at at the

783
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,319
parade all these all these gay guys

784
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,040
dancing sort of half naked in the

785
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,480
streets uh which is fine um but it

786
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,960
couldn't help but confirm for me my

787
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,200
suspicion that perhaps if in fact

788
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,319
instead of having uh gone to the gym all

789
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,079
the time

790
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:31,599
um they'd instead put some of those

791
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,760
hours into actually sort of attempting

792
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,760
to advance their civil rights uh then

793
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,640
today today we'd have no need for the

794
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,839
parade at all you

795
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,880
know like I don't know what Martin

796
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,160
Luther King Jr was packing under his

797
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,119
suit that day he made that speech um but

798
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,119
that's the point you

799
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,240
know I recently joined Montreal's Gates

800
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,599
trade Alliance we go in the city beating

801
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,599
up the B

802
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,359
bisexuals but I can't stand these big

803
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,839
Burly guys who always like come on admit

804
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:11,800
it Dave you're a

805
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:16,000
[ __ ] and I'm just like isn't it enough

806
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,000
that you're inside of

807
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,319
me this year though um these American

808
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,640
scientists sort of cured uh an a newborn

809
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:33,280
an infant of its of its

810
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,520
HIV and so now it's like uh you know for

811
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,440
years now for me um in order to cure my

812
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,440
own AIDS I've been [ __ ] the wrong

813
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,440
baby

814
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,200
um some people don't like that when I

815
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,040
tell that joke but I feel like Gary's

816
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,480
life is over anyway you know so like

817
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,640
what's the what's the

818
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,520
difference all I'm saying though is at

819
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,720
what point ought we to be granting to

820
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,720
person sort of legal autonomy to make

821
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,599
decisions over their own lives um like

822
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,800
what if one day

823
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,839
uh I'm just lying there

824
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,760
uh perfectly

825
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:19,680
still not

826
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:22,200
moving not not moving at all and a baby

827
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,440
uh happens to crawl

828
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,839
up onto my naked

829
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,720
body

830
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,319
and I don't I don't move I just lie

831
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,640
there perfectly

832
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:37,359
still and and and

833
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,560
unassuming

834
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,560
and it takes me into its

835
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,600
mouth and it starts to fate me um with

836
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,910
its beautiful little baby

837
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,400
[Applause]

838
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:58,400
[Laughter]

839
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
breath

840
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,240
and I'm still not

841
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,079
moving wouldn't that be

842
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,839
awesome there's no like good way to go

843
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,839
into my rape

844
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,599
material cuz there's a question as to

845
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,680
whether we live in a rape culture which

846
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,280
is one that sort of condones and

847
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,960
normalizes and accepts it and I don't

848
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,760
think that we do CU I think that if we

849
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,079
did I think people would enjoy these

850
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,800
next jokes much more

851
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,520
um because in Cleveland OH there in

852
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Cleveland there was this there was a Sex

853
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,400
Dungeon um these women were kept in The

854
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,119
Sex Dungeon for years which it's like

855
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,359
one of those horrific things I can I can

856
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,599
I can I can think of um and I saw on TV

857
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:56,920
one of the women uh read her Victim

858
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,680
Impact statement in court

859
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,359
and she was saying like You know despite

860
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,400
the things you did to me the indignities

861
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,760
I suffered at your hands

862
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,400
and it's like I can still be the person

863
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,400
I want and live the life that I want I'm

864
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,000
going be the person I I can be on and on

865
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,960
and on and on it's like what are you

866
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,839
talking to what do you mean shut up like

867
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,240
shut shut the [ __ ] up

868
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,160
like after everything you've gone

869
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,200
through you still think you're capable

870
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,119
of doing what you want in your

871
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,359
life then how am I

872
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,880
able to blame my

873
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,760
parents for the basically the right

874
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,880
decisions they made you know how are any

875
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,240
how's any of us to blame our

876
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,359
circumstances for where we are in

877
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,599
life I think she have to go back on

878
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,960
television and and and and and and and

879
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,040
and and sort of recant and apologizing

880
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,119
I'm sorry like I made a mistake like my

881
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,200
life is over and it's just [ __ ] and I

882
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,800
can't do anything and like then it's a

883
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,640
service to humanity that's her place in

884
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,560
the cosmos I think that's a go back and

885
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,560
do what's right you

886
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
know I've just never been a great

887
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,160
advocate of life you know um which is to

888
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,599
say that I don't think it's good um

889
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,920
unconditionally like I don't know what

890
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,480
to say anymore when a when a when when a

891
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,480
friend tells me uh they're

892
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,040
pregnant it's okay get up just stand up

893
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,280
stand up and stand up stand up it's okay

894
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,599
it's okay okay it's all right it wasn't

895
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,760
going well anyway I wasn't feeling that

896
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,480
one so it's okay it's

897
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,720
good like I don't know what to say

898
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,200
anymore when a friend me they're

899
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,640
pregnant like you want a kid just like

900
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,119
you want anything else in life it's

901
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,880
something outside of you in the world

902
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,319
that you think will make you

903
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,760
happy like just because I don't I may

904
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:40,880
not want a kid doesn't mean I'm any more

905
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,200
selfish a person like maybe I I want a

906
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,359
couch you

907
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,920
know so I'll get that couch and when my

908
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:51,000
time comes I will leave that couch to

909
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,200
another couch or whatever you know but I

910
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,440
don't know I think the only way that I

911
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,760
could have a kid would be if I were to

912
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,000
accidentally impregnate a girl and it be

913
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,839
out of my hands but like to decide for

914
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,559
another point of self-awareness that

915
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:08,480
this is worth it to sort of Burden it to

916
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:11,520
have to kill its own time till its own

917
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,480
demise just cuz I can't make it on my

918
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,170
own

919
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,000
alone it's anyway ah

920
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,359
[Music]

921
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,839
anyway and I would love to be a father I

922
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:24,359
think I think be so much fun but I can't

923
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,520
do this to another human being you know

924
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:28,400
at least with my experience of life um

925
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,640
so I think what you should what we

926
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,040
should do when someone tells you they're

927
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,520
pregnant is you know we ought to wait

928
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,680
like seven 8 years uh and then turn to

929
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,000
the kid and be like how do you feel

930
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,000
about

931
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:50,359
this and if they're

932
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,839
like ah it's worth it or anything above

933
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:54,319
then we should turn to the parents and

934
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,319
be like oh

935
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,079
congratulations

936
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,760
one time I almost I had this like near I

937
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,680
I was almost hit by hit by a car and my

938
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:12,079
whole life flashed before my eyes and it

939
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:12,079
was just one long [ __ ] shot compilation

940
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,280
um and I was like yeah I I figured as

941
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,640
much like this

942
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,319
is I was in Greenwich London England

943
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:25,400
which is like the center no man just get

944
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,160
up yeah that's okay man no it's totally

945
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,760
yeah yeah it's okay okay yeah that's

946
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,480
good no I think it's fine yeah yeah okay

947
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,839
okay well we we'll edit that out I think

948
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,000
that

949
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:39,599
uh I was in Gran Lon England um and

950
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,760
there's this old Observatory uh and

951
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,400
there's an exhibit on the cosmos and so

952
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,040
we are like just one planet revolving

953
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,800
around a single star in uh a galaxy of

954
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,599
billions of stars which itself is within

955
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,000
a universe of billions of

956
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,520
galaxies and so so if intelligent life

957
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,400
came about once it's not that there's a

958
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,160
mere possibility that it may have come

959
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,240
about about a single other time but

960
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,800
rather there's a good reason to think

961
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,440
that it would have come about

962
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,720
innumerable other

963
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:15,319
times and I I I I stood there trying to

964
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:20,680
take take it all in and I couldn't help

965
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:24,119
but feel that there had to be a better

966
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,119
astronomy exhibit out

967
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,880
there

968
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,839
I think the homeless though

969
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:36,040
um I think what really bothers me with

970
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,559
the homeless I think they're lazy I

971
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,599
think that's their main problem about

972
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,079
like about half of them haven't even

973
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,570
finished you know to bother growing all

974
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,700
their limbs

975
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:48,700
[Laughter]

976
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,359
um but really what it is like stop like

977
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,920
what I don't understand like why why why

978
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:58,240
the why aren't why aren't the homeless

979
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,960
always the first in line at record store

980
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,400
autograph signings you know I

981
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,640
mean I I mean you're going to sleep on

982
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,640
the street anyway you

983
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,599
know you might as well meet Drake you

984
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,040
know

985
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,040
anyway I was working though uh we're

986
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,880
coming to the end though I I I I mean

987
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,880
maybe we'll see

988
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,599
so this friend of mine though last

989
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,240
weekend she she revealed me she has

990
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:41,359
cancer uh I however chose not to burden

991
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,359
her with how she'd uh ruined my

992
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,079
evening often times after after I said

993
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,480
the the MC will come back on and be like

994
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,880
oh like David's available for children's

995
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,000
parties and weddings and bids fuzz and

996
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,359
everyone will

997
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,200
laugh but the fact is I actually am

998
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,200
available for children's parties

999
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,000
and I think that the I think though the

1000
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,960
thing that I find most intrinsically

1001
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,960
degrading about elder

1002
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:22,960
abuse is the constant having to remind

1003
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,960
them as to why you're treating them so

1004
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,720
badly

1005
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,800
no

1006
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:35,720
but I was reading about this kid with

1007
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,559
mustroph who was teased so badly by this

1008
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:41,000
other kid about his muscular distrophy

1009
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,800
that uh he killed

1010
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,400
himself and at least you know to my mind

1011
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:52,559
um just to have the capacity to do such

1012
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,599
a thing it really doesn't sound like

1013
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,599
such severe muscular distrophy

1014
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,839
but what I find most I can't understand

1015
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,440
the most is these people with like these

1016
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,280
incredible physical disabilities who

1017
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,599
nonetheless are capable of maintaining a

1018
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,960
deep religious

1019
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,800
Faith CU you're like you think that like

1020
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,599
like you know like given like what they

1021
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,359
they're already forced to put up with in

1022
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,920
this world God would have at least

1023
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,920
spared their

1024
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,000
minds I don't know I think the one thing

1025
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,599
though the one sort of civil rights

1026
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,800
movement I can get behind is the fight

1027
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:35,720
for the for the for the right to

1028
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,400
assisted suicide uh CU I mean not not

1029
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,640
being able to kill

1030
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,640
yourself you that's that's that's no way

1031
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,640
to live

1032
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:50,040
um but what I really don't get about

1033
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,040
retards

1034
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:54,599
uh is the always going around in the

1035
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,359
velcro scrap

1036
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,400
shoes

1037
00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:03,160
cuz like I can get like not having the

1038
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:05,480
manual dexterity to like operate the

1039
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,319
laces but what's wrong with a nice penny

1040
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,319
loafer you

1041
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,319
know maybe that's part of the maybe

1042
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,559
that's part of the whole retardation

1043
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:18,000
thing I don't

1044
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:20,160
know anyway I know it's like I know it's

1045
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,400
like convention to uh to to to want to

1046
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,400
leave an audience wanting more

1047
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,200
um but like if I'm going to be getting

1048
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,760
off anyway I feel like that's like the

1049
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,520
crest way of going about it

1050
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:38,359
um there's no real

1051
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:42,319
closing number to this I guess that

1052
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:44,240
uh we stick around and have some ending

1053
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:47,880
what you mean this

1054
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,559
is terrible ending to a

1055
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,839
show so happy New Year and thank you
