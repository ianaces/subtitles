that

158
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,000
fantastic now Judo what's the difference

159
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,759
between karate and Judo well mainly the

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,280
biggest difference is that judo's in the

161
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,000
wrestling uh category of of sport okay

162
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,440
uh and karate and Taekwondo uh in the

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,280
more in the boxing or the hitting and

164
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,919
kicking the Striking aspect so in Judo

165
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,560
we don't do any hitting or kicking it's

166
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,280
a grappling Sport and it evolved out of

167
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,159
jiujitsu which was a martial art or a

168
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,520
fighting style so it it was originally

169
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,800
designed to be a sport in a form of

170
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,639
physical education okay and jiujitsu is

171
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,159
is the mother and father of and Judo

172
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,560
more or less yes you're right exactly

173
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,000
that's the sort of thing the old Samurai

174
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,159
Warriors the guys with the big swords

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,719
and everything used to do uh Jiu-Jitsu

176
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,320
was hand toand combat for them when they

177
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,680
dropped their sword or or whatever

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,839
weapon they were using or did close in

179
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,880
fighting and they didn't do a lot of

180
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,160
hitting and kicking back then because

181
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,279
everybody wore armor you know so hurt a

182
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,839
lot to hit them right right what's the

183
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,800
difference between that and say like the

184
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,240
Kung Fu that came out of China well

185
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,680
basically that's it the the Chinese uh

186
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,560
uh boxing styles are things like Kung Fu

187
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,760
and so it's just a different adaptation

188
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,480
it's another striking art from another

189
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,120
national origin okay okay typically now

190
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
you have this great school Northstar

191
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,040
Judo what uh who's your typical student

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,040
that comes in to study the martial art

193
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,959
we have a wide range uh we have uh kids

194
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,079
we have adults uh men women children uh

195
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,079
there is no typical student we have an

196
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,240
Olympic champion who trains there an 88

197
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,120
Olympic uh competitor from the US we

198
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,640
have Olympic team members we have

199
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,959
national team members and also we have

200
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,360
just ordinary people who want to have a

201
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,600
good time with a with a sport an

202
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,560
individual thing that they can do so we

203
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,440
have just people off the street who say

204
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,200
hey this looks like it might be fun mhm

205
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,120
now like I said it is a sport how how

206
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,120
real is this for like a self-defense

207
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,600
purposes the Judo is it is it an

208
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,279
effective self-defense method it's

209
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
excellent for that uh remembering first

210
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,440
of all it comes from Jiu-Jitsu and that

211
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,279
the prime purpose of Jiu-Jitsu was

212
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,800
personal defense in fact it was more

213
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,360
than that it was saving your life

214
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,000
Staying Alive in combat uh it also makes

215
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,760
a lot of sense because of the grappling

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,480
aspect most of the confrontations people

217
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,640
get into whether it's on a playground or

218
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,959
recess or whether it's in some other

219
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,640
altercation that could be far more

220
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,720
serious normally really uh aside from

221
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,519
what you see in the movies goes into a

222
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,200
Hands-On grappling Close Quarters sort

223
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,120
of Confrontation and often times ends up

224
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,800
on the ground so the hitting and kicking

225
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,640
that you see in the movies sometimes is

226
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,040
a little bit farther out of field than

227
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,120
the reality of the thing absolutely I

228
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,920
know I was in the I was in looking in

229
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,440
the mirror one day and uh and it was

230
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
incredible we started the guy started he

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,040
didn't think I looked as good as I think

232
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,640
I looked and I know that I look good and

233
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,360
he kept looking at me all funny and he

234
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,440
started kicking grappling and it wasn't

235
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,320
a real deal people watch those martial

236
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,720
arts movies and think that's real

237
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,920
martial arts but that's not that's

238
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,560
Entertainment That's Entertainment

239
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,279
that's exactly what it is okay in fact

240
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,880
let's take a look at some real Judo we

step on up Bill and Bill you are a

248
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,079
champion too in your own right um I'm

249
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,120
sorry

250
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,240
I compete nationally and I'm I'm on the

251
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,480
US Judo team now Junior Judo team oh

252
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,959
that's fantastic so what you going to

253
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,279
demonstrate for us first well we'll

254
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,040
demonstrate a little bit maybe just real

255
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,600
quickly about what makes Judo work okay

256
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,440
let's take a look let's do yeah let's do

257
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,800
this units a strength thing uh let's

258
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,959
just imagine that Bill's bigger than I

259
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,600
am and hold on wait wait how about how

260
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,760
about how about bigger and better

261
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,720
looking only with your

262
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,120
help and uh so if bill has 10 units of

263
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,399
strength and let's say and I have only

264
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,720
five let's say I'm half as strong so

265
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,320
Bill pushes me and I push him it's sort

266
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,680
of like a semi-trailer in a Volkswagen

267
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,880
right okay so Bill's going to push me

268
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,079
and I'm going to push back but that

269
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,480
won't do me much good right okay so what

270
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,959
I have to do is I have to yield when he

271
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,959
pushes me and I have to use his strength

272
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,920
all 10 units and maybe one of mine to

273
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,320
get him off balance okay now I appla

274
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,320
some of the laws of physics here put a

275
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,160
little leverage down in the corner use

276
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,639
another unit of strength over he goes

277
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,800
and I still got two units left to laugh

278
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,639
at him

279
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,440
wow so this is an effective form of so

280
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,000
use his own strength against them that's

281
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,560
exactly the idea okay give us another

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,360
give us another demonstration well just

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,839
real quickly uh let's just say even

284
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,200
though we are mostly a sport let's just

285
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,760
make an answer for that self-defense

286
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
question okay and suppose that Bill's

287
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,760
going to strike me on top of the head

288
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,000
let's do it this way bill because I

289
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,519
don't want you to H that

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,160
table um and what I'm going to do is

291
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,680
Bill got even bigger uh is I'm going to

292
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,079
just deflect that blow and use that

293
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,839
momentum to throw Bill onto the matap

294
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:36,519
okay

295
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,600
W all right great stuff now what if you

296
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,839
don't know how to fall now he knows how

297
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,959
to fall you know if you threw someone

298
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,240
like that and they didn't know how to

299
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,360
fall that could cause some injury on the

300
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
concrete especially

301
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,079
yes learning how to fall is worth the

302
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,399
price of admission to a judo school

303
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,440
because everybody takes a fall sometimes

304
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,079
whether it's off a skateboard or walking

305
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,360
down the street or in the uh on the ice

306
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,320
you know so falling skills are very

307
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,920
important okay let's see him throw you

308
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,639
around a little bit once okay this will

309
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,639
cost you

310
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,320
okay wow that's out of sight all right

311
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,720
give him a round of applause all

312
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,920
right all right coming up next we got a

313
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,079
PSA and then I'm going to get in the

314
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,760
