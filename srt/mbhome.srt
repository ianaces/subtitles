1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,000
this is my mom Marilyn Bamford and this

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,559
is my poppy Joel Bamford and uh this is

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,799
Blossom and I'm Maria Manford and I'm

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:18,439
sitting sandwiched beneath between my

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,519
loved ones sandwiched oh I think Maria

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,680
is definitely the funniest she's I mean

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,720
she was funny when she was a little girl

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,760
sah she was a little girl she was

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,000
constantly funny I mean her sister Sarah

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,560
is very funny but in a different way but

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
but Maria was always looking for the

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,559
laugh and for the joke was always kind

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
of making fun of herself it was between

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,440
you were between like these I remember

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,800
you we these two wicker chairs and you

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,399
would you know hold on to both of them

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,879
and then do upside down

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,800
somersaults and we would be excited by

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,000
that and she'd think that was great we'd

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,840
laugh and that's really more of a cry

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,160
for

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,000
help you were liking it no I did enjoy I

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,280
remember flipping but flipping suggests

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
career in acrobatics much more than I

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,600
know but you like the Laugh you liked it

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,280
when we laughed I do like it I like like

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,000
that people laughing yeah I was a quiet

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,080
kid though I'd say you were quiet and

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,799
you enjoyed things like that was that

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,799
would have been a performance where you

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,759
get some action but I you you were doing

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,000
it for yourself and then we get to watch

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
that's what my career is like I'm doing

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,479
it for myself exactly and would wants to

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,079
show up that's cool yeah

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,840
yeah oh that's funny well I think it's

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,960
you know you're really remarkable being

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,280
able to put yourself out in front and

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,759
and see if people laugh and be able to

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,520
say well I didn't laugh at that um maybe

41
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,920
you shouldn't have paid for a ticket

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,200
yeah yeah

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,200
exactly maybe you buddy shouldn't have

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:57,600
paid 25 bucks to get in here if you

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
don't get what I'm doing

46
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,310
[Music]

47
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,800
[Music]

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Skyway

49
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,680
Skyway you get it it's a way to walk

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,319
through the

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:32,400
sky but it's usually just a

52
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,400
a kind of a brown Bridge with

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,400
Windows uh Plan B is

54
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,440
uh I did always want to be on a sitcom

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,400
and then I tried I auditioned and I did

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,560
uh a couple little tiny tiny parts and I

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,760
and uh I every time I went on a sitcom I

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,959
I thought a sitcom was going to be more

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,959
like you know actually the sitcom story

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,560
like where it's like so and so and and I

61
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,720
mean I was I was a guest star so uh you

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,120
know maybe it's not I'm not more of a

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,280
temp than a family member and um but it

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,319
wasn't that much fun like it was kind of

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,319
stressful and you had to put on a lot of

66
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,040
makeup and outfits and it was kind of it

67
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,120
was kind of a bad experience for me and

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,760
then I didn't I I

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,280
didn't uh I didn't enjoy it was really

70
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,159
because there's so much money involved

71
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,439
with sitcoms now I mean maybe it's

72
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,360
different on a like like a lower amount

73
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,599
of money but people seem really

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,200
terrified like of losing their jobs like

75
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,200
so everyone's

76
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,879
like cuz and they pay so much attention

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,920
to the script that it almost doesn't you

78
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,519
know I don't know it just doesn't it did

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,360
what didn't seem as fun you know cuz I

80
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,720
like from standup you know you just say

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
whatever you think is funny and you

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,360
don't have to have 70 people

83
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,879
going

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,400
no I think I think a banana is funny

85
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,159
sure I mean but the classic the banana

86
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,480
that's

87
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,239
funny why don't we go though let's

88
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,519
zigzag and go with a tangerine instead

89
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,879
like was all like talk like sort of like

90
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,120
the what's funny or something and it

91
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,359
just made me sad and tired but maybe

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,959
that's because I didn't get more parts

93
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,240
uh I'm sure if I got more parts maybe it

94
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,400
incredible it's very easy to uh to

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,240
criticize something that you can't get

96
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,639
into yeah that stuff's [ __ ]

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,680
that whole Fame and success thing you

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,000
know it just brings you down I'm not

99
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,000
into

100
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,039
it oh yeah so so but um it was yeah so I

101
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,600
did a couple things what was the other

102
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:50,800
thing on that oh and then I found every

103
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:54,120
time I was on a sitcom which is twice uh

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,320
this isn't a very thorough study uh but

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,479
I had to wear these giant boobs boow and

106
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,960
you know they said that was a part of

107
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:04,280
the character and that you know like

108
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,400
somehow I just thought that was so funny

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,320
I was like but you hired me to like I

110
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,800
don't I just so anyways the point is I

111
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,479
was frustrated that oh I want to do my

112
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,919
own sitcom cuz there's this whole

113
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,919
process of doing a sitcom too where you

114
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,039
have to meet with development people and

115
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,120
then they they they hire writers and it

116
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,160
just seems so like such a long way that

117
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
I could never I me know just seem so I

118
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,199
thought do it myself do it myself do it

119
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
myself and without

120
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,600
you know that I don't need anybody's

121
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,319
help I find that I mean maybe it's

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,280
antisocial but I think that's the best

123
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,000
way sometimes to do things is when you

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,840
don't need anybody's help so then nobody

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,400
can criticize it cuz it's just like you

126
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,120
can do whatever you want so that's

127
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,440
that's why I did that's that's what

128
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,840
that's what that's why I did I also had

129
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,639
a fantasy of moving home to duth

130
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,960
sometimes when I get depressed which is

131
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,759
every day uh so uh I think well you know

132
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,960
if you transplanted everything to a new

133
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,960
city you go oh maybe then I would you

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,720
know then I'd wear different outfits and

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I'd have different coffee shops to go to

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,960
so I'd feel different and um so then I

137
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,240
thought so that was a way to act out my

138
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,199
fantasy of we to to and how it might

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,800
actually be so um but I might I might Mo

140
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,800
I don't know it's pretty sweet

141
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,080
here my current

142
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,599

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,560
for it's for under earning and it's for

146
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,960
people if you have any problems with

147
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,479
like money if you're getting into too

148
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,240

that's an awesome one I love a 12-step

151
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,840
program uh anyway you slice it uh love

152
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,759
it cuz it's free people talk about their

153
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,479
feelings I can't get enough that I love

154
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,039
people talking about their feelings and

155
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,400
uh and you get to

156
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:07,240
and they're at night and they're calm

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,400
and kind of it's nice um yeah I went to

158
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,560
I know I shouldn't say you

159
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,160
know yeah there's anonymity or whatever

160
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,240
that's good for people who care about it

161
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,520
but uh I I don't really care too much

162
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,319
but I love that's my favorite one for

163
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,759
now I don't want I switch over um da

164
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,120
also a lot of times they have pretty

165
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,639
good snacks cuz they're into abundance

166
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,800
the meetings in Los Angeles have have

167
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,199
tons of good snacks there oh forg to go

168
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,840
to an overeater town house meeting

169
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,319
that's kind of a bummer cuz there's no

170
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,560
snacks and uh there's a lot of

171
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,520
sugar-free

172
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,639

173
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,840
good one I can only go to opening me cuz

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,599
hear people talk and uh and uh they

176
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,560
usually have good snacks too they have

177
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,479
cakes and stuff if cuz if you have a

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,840
certain amount of time ready to get a

179
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,840
cake that's

180
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,360
nice I always thought when I was a kid

181
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,720
it'd be fun to be a prostitute because

182
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,560
you don't realize what it is like cuz

183
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,199
you always see them on TV and they're

184
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,520
wearing fancy clothes then they go

185
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,800
shopping and then they they like meet up

186
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,199
with some kind of older guy or like a

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,800
business guy and he's nice and then they

188
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,479
just go and then it's the next day and

189
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,240
then they get to go shopping again

190
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,320
you're like oh that sounds good uh but

191
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,800
then they didn't show the part where

192
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,159
you're not enjoying yourself presumably

193
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,959

196
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,000
times sometimes the guy isn't very good

197
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,000
looking or he isn't so

198
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,440

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,959
Australia some

200
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,279
sometimes

201
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,120
Australia that's my Australian accent I

202
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:14,399
was on a radio station in Australia and

203
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,920
um the radio announcer said you you

204
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:22,480
Australian exent is

205
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:26,839
terrible terrible it needs a lot of work

206
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:31,079
inside I tell her to get fued which is

207
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,640
an old Australian say no no that no I I

208
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,160
I don't do a very good Australia I do

209
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,440
love Australia though it's beautiful

210
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,560
it's wonderful and they're lovely and

211
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,160
it's and not just that it's got a

212
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,279
wonderful comedy and arts scene they

213
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,440
have they still have wonderful funding

214
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,440
by their

215
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,880
government for the Arts which is

216
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,959
something we could get

217
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,519
into we'd have to move to

218
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:58,120
Australia which is only a boat ride away

219
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
we could uh yeah get a boat get over

220
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
there

221
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,519
this is Lake Superior which is I think

222
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:15,640
the deepest of the Lakes I don't think

223
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:18,240
it's the biggest I'm not sure on that uh

224
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,040
maybe you can Google it uh anyways

225
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,120
beautiful Lake and I I've been on the

226
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,079
lake I've been on a Vista Cruis or too

227
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,920
over time I've also been out on a

228
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,440
sailboat uh sailboats make me nervous

229
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,959
cuz it always sort of activities you got

230
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:39,079
to do uh my dad would yell at us hardly

231
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,720
hardly coming about coming come on Jesus

232
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:45,360
come on Pull It in

233
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,399
pull oh was terrifying cuz part of is

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,839
where you go up high and people like

235
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,880
that when one side looks like it's

236
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,079
tipping over people like that part uh

237
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,720
that's not my favorite part my part is

238
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,920
when I

239
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,240
sit and eat a cracker with cheese spread

240
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,240
on it

241
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,079
and then it's kind of there's no

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,240
wind I find it funny and weird to uh

243
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,079
that I'm uh

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,760
talking about stuff in front of my

245
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,760
parents they're right here I didn't tell

246
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,120
you that they're right here that's weird

247
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:34,120
now now it's like an intervention woo oh

248
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,560
but on who who is the intervention on

249
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,720
we'll find

250
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,279
out Mom we have something to talk

251
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,800
about um every

252
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:50,399
time you buy fat-free ice cream I feel

253
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,000
angry and I feel scared because I like

254
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,880
regular ice

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,760
cream dad did you want to say your

256
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,720
feelings when she buys fat free ice

257
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,720
cream no okay I bought

258
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,839
sugarfree I like to be as comfortable as

259
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,519
I

260
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,199
can when I'm back in my hometown just

261
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,199
try to get

262
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,600
comfortable they don't have a lot of

263
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,839
benches down here so you just got to do

264
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,000
what you

265
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,320
can that'd be the first thing that I'd

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,720
do is i' if I had any money I'd dedicate

267
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,120
to my hometown like a like a couple

268
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,120
benches could sit

269
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,279
on yeah I used to impersonate things off

270
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,440
the TV so like things

271
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:58,160
off ladies talking on television about

272
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,279
things like I I did that on uh yeah that

273
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,639
there was a drops tooth polish

274
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:08,000
commercial that I like to impersonate M

275
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:10,600
Pearl drops tooth polish it's a great

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,160
feeling do you like do you like that Mom

277
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,800
was that pretty good I was like five

278
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:20,120
that must have been creepy but uh but uh

279
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,120
yeah so I did I did those kind

280
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,800
of when I come back home I think I

281
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,600
probably shouldn't be doing

282
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,240
impersonation to my family that and

283
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,839
somehow it seems like maybe it's not as

284
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
funny as I think it is just because you

285
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,279
know that what if it hurts their

286
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,480
feelings but then they think it's fun to

287
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,920
a point but then they oh I don't know

288
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,600
it's a mixed psychological bag but uh

289
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,760
but they're Pro I mean they let me in

290
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,760
