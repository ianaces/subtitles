systems for personal defense yes I uh

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,959
chose a couple of items that uh

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,720
conveniently fit into to a person's uh

47
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,440
purse so that uh okay well let's take a

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,159
look at some of the um weapons that u m

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,040
Mrs uh vessel has brought with

50
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:17,480
us well yes the first one that I brought

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,159
could we get a close-up of this yes um

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,680
first one is

53
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:27,400
uh uh one might think this was a tube of

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,920
lipstick or perhaps a keychain see that

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,120
or perhaps a bottle opener yes

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,760
but conveniently we've disguised uh my

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,400
company and I have disguised a small

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,879
bottle of Mace this is Mace this is Mace

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,560
yes as you can see it it has a um a pen

60
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,959
latch here just I just be careful yes it

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,720
it has a pen latch here which you can

62
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,280
use and you can fit inside your pocket

63
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,120
much like um much like any any normal

64
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,120
pen in a pocket liner so say that uh

65
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,799
later on we will be having a

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,280
demonstration of both of the products

67
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:08,000
yes um Mrs vessel will Mrs vessel and I

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,760
will be demonstrating how to how to use

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,439
this and another product which her

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,799
company carries called a stun gun yes

71
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,519
and we will be demonstrating both of

72
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,040
these items and how to use them for so

73
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,199
you can see at home what is the best way

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,160
and it is an actual demonstration this

75
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,240
yes yes an actual demonstration uh to

76
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:33,960
show how a a woman can protect herself

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,240
mhm against uh uh any sort of attack

78
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,440
from anyone specifically men

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,680
specifically men I have uh researched

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,759
this yes and have noticed that most

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,600
attacks on women are from men really yes

82
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,720
um generally your age group where have

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,759
where have you gotten this data where

84
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,080
have you where have you come up with

85
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,320
this hypothesis well uh I have

86
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,479
researched it in Rock Creek and out of

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,960
the four attacks that have been there in

88
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,199
the past 3 years they were all done uh

89
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,520
by men on women yes and so I felt that

90
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,160
it was my Dy what was the evidence that

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,600
they' hadd been attacked by

92
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,919
men there was uh one Polaroid picture

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,160
the uh other victim had uh after well

94
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,840
you know those can be

95
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,720
doctored and we'll be right back after

96
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,720
this word we'll be right back

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,960
hey woke up to have my toes this morning

98
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,360
and the first thing that I knew there

99
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,560
were sticks and mud and honey and a bowl

100
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,720
of orange Pips too and the sound pour in

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,319
like butterscotch and stuck to all that

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,120

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,639
know what I am a little bit tired of is

118
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,599
all this nepotism that's going on in

119
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,680
this country your your uncle owns the

120
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,880

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,440
there are so many problems with this

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,560
country people are just being lazy

129
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,759
they're not trying to do anything new

130
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,039
they're just taking it easy and they're

131
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,199

weapons weapons yes I would love to talk

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,919
about that well let's talk about weapons

143
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,759
now all

144
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,319
right what weapons the mace and the stun

145
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
gun the stun gun the stun gun how much

146
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,360
do they cost the stun gun is very

147
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,599
reasonably priced at $ 59.77 well that's

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,039
absolutely ridiculous $59 for it's a the

149
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,639
most simplest piece of electronic

150
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,280
circuitry I've ever seen I I took one

151
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,800
apart before the show it's simply two

152
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,360
electrodes and a a small circuit breaker

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,759
and a transistor that boosts the power

154
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,879
of the battery and it the voltage and

155
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,960
you're charging $60 for that I have my

156
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,680
own stun gun available now it's coming

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,039
on the market a Spiner stun gun for only

158
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,639
$30 I don't see what anyone needs to

159
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,159
spend $60 for a um a simple piece of

160
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,560
electronic equipment uh you can pick the

161
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:24,919
parts up at any store like Radio Shack

162
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,599
or Acme for a very modest cost and the

163
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,960
mace as far as the mace goes that's uh

164
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,000
very simple chemical compound which you

165
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,640
can find in any chemical supply store um

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,479
the chemicals are uh if if you write to

167
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,080
me I can send you the chemical uh makeup

168
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,440
of Mace just send a letter to Dr

169
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,040
sphincter and I'll send you the uh

170
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,000
chemical equation anyone want to know

171
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,040
the chemical makeup of Mace because so

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,720
they can make it themselves I make mace

173
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,200
on a daily basis want to why would

174
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,480
anyone want to make mace because it's a

175
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,760
it's a protectant you can put mace on

176
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,200
vinyl and other um products and it's a

177
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,040
very good protectant much better than

178
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Armor All I found and it's uh quite it's

179
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,000
a very easy product to make um and and

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,880
you can also sell it which I do I sell

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,200
mace out of my basement um and anyone

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,839
can make it it's very simple and for you

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,800
to come on and say that you have these

184
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,839
products and they're that expensive it's

185
