Distillery cuz why not right and listen

136
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,080
to your music on Edison cylinders unless

do is special and unique I don't give a

142
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,000
[ __ ] if you raised a pig yourself in the

143
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,720
back of a butcher shop on a 1200 thread

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,400
count Egyptian cotton sheet and hand

145
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,160
FedEd candied walnuts while the movie

146
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,720
Bryan song plays in the background on an

147
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,319
endless loop until the pig just succumbs

148
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,639
to its own onwe and holds its breath

149
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,000
voluntarily committing suicide

150
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,599
painlessly and quietly in a bar and made

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,680
of thousand-year-old repurposed wood

152
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,440
from an ancient spice trading vessel

153
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,919
