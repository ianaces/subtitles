1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,840
obviously this isn't my natural

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,599
climate I had to actually take six

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,080
inches off of my beard just to

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,800
survive the weather this week so I'm a

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,680
standup comic actually up in he said

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,160
Fargo and that's true but I spent most

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,840
of my time on the Minnesota side I'm a

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,160
stand up comic in Northwestern Minnesota

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,760
which essentially means I'm desperate

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,720
for stage

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,359
time perform for a lot of

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,399
deer so so much so that last year I did

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,440
five minutes at my day job company's

14
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,280
Christmas

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,239
party as part of a talent competition

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,239
that I did not

17
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,600
win funny part for me though is the day

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,360
before the show got an email from the

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
woman in human resources and she was

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,920
like hey Adam because that's how she

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,359
sounds in her email voice in my

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,160
head she said hey Adam do you think at

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,440
the show you could keep it like a PG13

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,680
set

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,520
that's no good but then I went online

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,600
looked up what PG-13 meant found myself

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
some

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,880
leway yeah because apparently when

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,880
something is PG-13 you can be partially

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,720
nude remember I said I did not win that

31
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,880
competition it's not a nude Christmas

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,200
winner another funny thing about my day

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,040
job I used to be in the training

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,439
department in my day job which in case

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,439
you didn't know means sometimes you got

36
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,439
to go out and meet with other people who

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,720
work in other training departments and

38
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:43,040
other day jobs because dreams don't come

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,040
true oh yeah that that that probably

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,040
doesn't go over too well in

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,000
paradise usually it's like nobody laughs

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,880
and I just think I'm performing for a

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,920
room full of astronauts and princesses

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,759
it's like oh a lot of success stories

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,399
good well pretend you've failed at most

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,119
things you've ever tried

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,360
and you'll enjoy the next 10 minutes of

48
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,920
my set a lot more quite

49
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,920
frankly want to be

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,680
relatable got to be relatable so I was

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,360
at one of these meetings last May and

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,480
the woman who organized the meeting was

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,480
like all right everybody let's do an ice

54
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:26,640
breaker how about we go around the room

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,120
and why don't you say your name and uh

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,760
where you work and oh just for

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:39,640
F why don't you tell us if you played

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,640
any April Fool's pranks this year

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,599
D I may have imagined that sound in

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,120
context I don't know she actually said

61
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,660
that they liked itting back good enough

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,640
for

63
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:56,280
[Laughter]

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,080

65
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,200

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,280
fools I was just calling people and

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,480
begging them to play pranks on me

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,840
because April fools meant so much to me

71
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,120

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,920
dad he passed away this last year and I

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,360
just thought it might be nice to

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,360
experience some APR fools in his

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,439

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,760
meeting going what the

77
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,599

did you play any April Fool's pranks

79
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,239

80
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,239

81
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,360
