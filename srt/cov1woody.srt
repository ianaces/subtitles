delightful podcast called my minute with

Andre oh you're so kind and uh it's it's

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,920
it's fun uh and it was fun for me to be

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,039
on especially since you let me ramble

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,680
for like three hours for some reason we

14
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,239
definitely ended up talking quite a

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,719
while on a on a wide range of topics

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,039
most most of which were cut out just

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,520
just in the interest of time not because

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,280
not because you're not delightful but

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,680
because my listeners are like you know

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,039
get make with the make with the wall of

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,760
Sean okay sure sure that makes that

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,840
makes sense what uh tell the audience a

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,840
little bit about yourself other than

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,960
your podcast about my Dinner with Andre

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,280
all right aside from my podcast that is

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,159
only about my Dinner with Andre I also

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,960
have other interests so I am a standup

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,119
comedian uh I live and work in uh in

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,680
Western New York I live in Rochester and

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,240
uh uh I play around the region currently

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,759
I'm also uh host a radio show called

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,159
Almost Tuesday that's a comedy variety

33
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,680
show that airs Monday nights around here

34
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,200
uh on a station called W yo and uh and

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,320
just you know I have a I have a huge

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,840
interest in comedy and I I've listen to

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,960
your show for a while as well so I was

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,040
excited to to hear from you about about

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,280
being on my

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,040
show what uh what kind of uh stuff is on

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,920
your radio show the only reason I ask is

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
because I never grew up with comedy as

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,680
an option on radio so I'm I'm always

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,479
curious so it's a variety show meaning

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,399
that we also have live music performance

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:07,000
every episode so it's uh awesome it is

47
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:10,879
like a miniature no budget version of a

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,080
maybe a Saturday Night Live or also has

49
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,120
a lot in common with like the best show

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,920
with Tom sharpling so it's we do a

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,319
variety of different comedy segments uh

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,879
we'll do sketch stuff that we've written

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,640
we'll also do uh sort of improvised

54
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,040
comedy segments we'll also do segments

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,959
where we're just talking uh about

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,599
whatever and then we also have guests so

57
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,560
you know like recently we had uh we had

58
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,440
on La comedian Barbara Gray we've had on

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,400

public radios Jesse Thorne we've had you

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,959
know a bunch of uh we we tend to pull in

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,159
some notable people to call in and talk

63
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,159
to us or be live in studio we're also

64
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,560
kind of on the pulse of the the the

65
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,480
comedy scene out here in Upstate New

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,000
York and extending into New York City

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,040
and we uh we have a lot of uh you know

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,680
we're just we're just kind of

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,120
documenting a lot of comedy and also you

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
know making up a bunch

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
ourselves that's uh that's delightful

72
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,720
can people stream it anywhere or is it

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,400
only on terrestrial R oh no of course

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,159
you can stream it uh so our uh you can

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,480
stream it at

76
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,959
wm.org that is uh Monday nights Eastern

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,280
Time 9 to 11 p.m. and then also we put

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,159
it out through a service because we also

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,000
play copyrighted music and stuff we use

80
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,360
the service called Mixcloud for archives

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,319
uh so that's mixcloud.com

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,439
Tuesday because they take care of the of

83
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,680
the licensing for the music stuff so

84
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,840
that way I don't have to chop up the

85
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,840
show into tiny pieces and put it and put

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,280
it out uh iTunes style because obviously

87
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,159
you throw that stuff in there and it

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,319
will it will eventually be

89
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,760
rejected right right yeah it's a pain in

90
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,879
the ass okay so let's do this uh Dana

91
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Gould's stuff was released eventually on

92
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,400
vinyl not originally so like we said

93
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,959
this is a 1998 album when did you first

94
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,000
hear it uh so I first heard it pretty

95
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439
close to when it came out I think I was

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,159
actually living in my first

97
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,880
apartment uh in I probably heard it in

98
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:20,919
1999 or 2000 but I had heard a bunch of

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,240
this material on TV prior to this

100
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:26,360
because Dana gold was in the ' 80s and

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,680
90s one of these perennial comedians who

102
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,520
you'd see on all of the television

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,880
showcase shows like evening at The

104
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,080
Improv etc etc etc uh so I had seen i'

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,919
had seen a bunch of these bits he was a

106
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
person who I never knew his name but I

107
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,520
knew stuff from his act and then I

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,440
learned who he was uh later on when I

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,919
was searching for comedy to listen to

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,120
and watch when I was living in my first

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,360
apartment with my roommates and we were

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,039
all big fans of like Mr Show and Dana

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,160
Gold's kind of Mr show adjacent like

114
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,280
sort of in the alternative comedy you

115
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,800
know boom of the mid late 990s

116
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,360
sure I used to think he was Paul F

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,039
Tomkins when I was a little bit younger

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,880
I confused him and Paul F Tomkins now

119
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,600
their voices aren't even that similar

120
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,199
they don't look they look a little

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,080
similar when Paul does not have a

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
mustache I call him Paul because of

123
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,280
course we're best friends first name

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,560
basis bu me uhhuh yeah we've been in a

125
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,000
room together once uh so uh yeah I used

126
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,479
to confuse the two of them and

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,759
eventually it sort of became clear that

128
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,520
they're very very different men

129
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,240
including in terms of style although I

130
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,520
don't know what kind of ComEd

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,880
Paul Tomkins was doing at this time uh

132
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,360
now I I I'll just tell people so you

133
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,600
know I enjoyed a lot of what I heard

134
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,759
it's a little dated oh it is it is and I

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,800
and that's part of the reason that I

136
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,160
picked it because I thought we'd have a

137
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,639
lot to talk about because I know that

138
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,400
you yeah there is I know on your show

139
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,840
you cover a lot you know what what you

140
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,600
could say and what you can't say or well

141
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,240
whatever you can say anything you want

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,840
but but what probably isn't going to get

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,280
a good reaction from an audience these

144
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,880
days and what people would find to be

145
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,400
uh questionable or offensive or hurtful

146
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,039
to some people or whatever uhuh yeah

147
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,919
yeah I mean and much as like I might

148
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,599
listen to it be like well you know he

149
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,039
means well it's also like well okay

150
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,280
that's fine if he means well but he

151
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,680
still said it but there's some really

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,160
funny [ __ ] on it too like there's

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,720
genuinely some very very funny stuff um

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,560
you can tell that his voice you can tell

155
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,120
what of his voice has flavored The

156
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,160
Simpsons since he started writing on it

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,680
too

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,880
absolutely it's so weird to me that this

159
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,479
this guy's particular obsession with

160
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,440
particular parts of Pop Culture have

161
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,120
made their way I don't know I I'm not

162
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,199
articulating it properly maybe you can

163
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,319
say it better because I I feel like

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
you're probably more familiar with his

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,400
work I know I know exactly what you're

166
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,960
trying to say like so Dana Gould has a

167
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,759
few different Fascinations which sort of

168
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,639
translate themselves into pop culture he

169
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,840
is obsessed with old science fiction and

170
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:07,400
uh uh movie and monster movies from like

171
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:10,199
the late 60s and backward so anything up

172
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,479
to anything from the universal monsters

173
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,800
up to Planet of the Apes is is all in

174
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,319
his wheelhouse and uh and Planet of the

175
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,960
Apes is like his favorite movie he's

176
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,800
been on a lot of podcasts talking about

177
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,520
it he has his own podcast where he's

178
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,680
talked about it at length um and then

179
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,479
also just old Hollywood culture is the

180
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,319
thing that he talks about a lot like old

181
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
polls of actors even if they weren't

182
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,639
actors in like monster movies or

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,039
anything he's he's sort of the guy for

184
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,919
those

185
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,879
references also things like uh also you

186
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,960
know

187
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,199
UFOs and uh and anything that you'd find

188
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,879
on the X Files that's also like kind of

189
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:55,840
in his uh right yeah and uh and then and

190
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:58,879
then also like uh 90 or 80s alternative

191
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,240
music like The Smiths and things like

192
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
that

193
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
for example on this record it's a very

194
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,479
particular world he lives in you know he

195
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,680
also he's fortunate because I've talked

196
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,879
about this before there are a bunch of

197
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,639
people who I've met who I just they'll

198
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
tell me the stories so I'm getting them

199
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,319
like third or fourth hand like their

200
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,400
associations with old Hollywood because

201
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,639
I love old Hollywood but I'll speak to

202
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,800
people they're like yeah I I speak

203
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,000
speaking to somebody who's been on the

204
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,960
show before yeah and he's like oh did I

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,199
tell you we were just having a

206
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,720
conversation on the phone he like did I

207
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,319
tell you I was friends with Milton Burl

208
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,879
and I'm like [ __ ] no you didn't tell me

209
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,039
you were friends with Milton burl guy is

210
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,159
too young to be friends with Milt he

211
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,560
knew him and right it's insane and like

212
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,120
he literally he got to walk into his

213
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,159
special humidor in his in this cigar

214
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,880
shop and he said hey give Dan a box of

215
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,000
my cigars you know the good ones from

216
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,160
direct from Cuba and oh wow like I'm

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,040
just like you [ __ ] and I mean

218
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,800
that in the politest way cuz I love this

219
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,560
particular Dan but uh it was just like

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,959
God damn it like that's a world that

221
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,120
I've missed and Dana Gould is there on

222
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,640
the cusp too of like they they weren't

223
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,680
all dead yet it's true and he made

224
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,519
friends with he like made friends with

225
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,160
Vampira oh my God like he he literally

226
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
he made he was actually supporting

227
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,279
Vampira in the last few years of her

228
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,839
life he was like paying her rent and

229
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,680
like taking her to the doctor and stuff

230
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,399
like that because he had befriended her

231
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,240
and it was kind of the she had she had

232
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,720
SE the same situation with Dana Gould as

233
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,079
like uh Edwood and Bella legosi in the

234
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,600
movie Edwood yes it's basically the same

235
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,600
relationship where he finds her and then

236
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,560
he becomes her like benefactor because

237
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,920
he's a super fan from his childhood is

238
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,000
it weird to that I partially and I I

239
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,880
feel like Dana G probably had this too

240
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,040
and that's why it happened you kind of

241
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,920
if you're me you're like I kind of want

242
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
to be that guy I kind of want to be the

243
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,320
guy who takes care of this this this

244
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,200
Legend who is unappreciated absolutely I

245
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,800
know is that weird thing when I hope to

246
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
do this with Steve

247
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,320
Gutenberg oh my God what I mean I'll

248
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,320
I'll settle for

249
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,640
I'm trying to it was my first pull of

250
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,600
like somebody that from my childhood who

251
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,680
I don't who isn't doing a ton of work

252
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,279
right now right is probably but I think

253
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,959
Good's probably doing fine he's he's

254
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,600
probably doing fine yeah absolutely prob

255
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,399
doesn't have to work that's the thing

256
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,680
that's that's a solid one no that's

257
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,320
pretty good I and like I Ran So I

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,160

episode will have run before yours does

260
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,440
cuz these are now way way way way way

261
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,839
behind I'm I behind is what's happened

262
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,440
it I I get it no we both are uh I

263
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,720
interviewed Paul douly the other day and

264
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,519
he's a delight and I didn't realize he

265
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,320
had just turned 90 so he's not only been

266
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,360
in St yeah forever but he also we're

267
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
talking after the interview shuts down

268
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,160
of course he's like yeah oh yeah and

269
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,600
then I met Buster Keaton uh he was my

270
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,800
hero and I got to meet Buster I'm like

271
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,360
oh [ __ ] there are some people around who

272
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,399
legit got to meet some people that I

273
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,720
would have killed to meet like you know

274
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,040
he he met Buster Katon he also talks

275
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,880
about how

276
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,360
on his second or third Robert Alman

277
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,639
movie Robert Alman had never read

278
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,800
anything he'd written or knew if he'

279
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,760
read anything hey you want to write a

280
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,720
movie for me like he's been had these

281
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
very weird Hollywood experiences that he

282
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,959
is just like he gets to Rattle off and

283
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm like damn that's the kind of

284
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,959
Hollywood that I want to of a connection

285
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,360
with you know so much fun yeah that's

286
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,639
yeah I I yeah the idea that there's that

287
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,920
there's still people alive who have like

288
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,320
these these stories from a time when

289
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,639
things are like simpler or like it was

290
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,720
smaller there were fewer there were

291
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,040
maybe fewer celebrities there were fewer

292
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,200
for sure there was less money somehow I

293
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,720
mean even though these people were Rich

294
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
it was like right you know movies

295
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,360
weren't making billions and billions of

296
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,880
dollars yeah yeah I I I actually kind of

297
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,639
wanted to ask Paul duly about this

298
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,279
because uh where I interviewed him was

299
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,079
in TCA Lake California which at one

300
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,200
point was basically owned by uh Bob Hope

301
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,680
Bob Hope basically owned this entire

302
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,399
part of la oh really and uh yeah and uh

303
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,800
you know I and I don't know enough of

304
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,920
the details I forgotten to add that's

305
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,079
that's that's a guy that I'd like to

306
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,959
interview somebody about again I'm sure

307
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,000
the the the previously mentioned Dan I'm

308
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,720
sure oh yes he did he wrote for Bob

309
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,480
newart on one of his last specials

310
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,199
that's what of the or not Bob newart Bob

311
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,639
Hope sorry wrote for Bob Hope on one of

312
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,440
his last specials and I'm like God damn

313
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,120
it you were like 20 how'd you get to

314
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
write for Bob Hope and why would he

315
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,720
that's whatever that's fine I'm very

316
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,639
jealous I'm very jealous of these guys

317
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,440
uh so when you first heard this like I

318
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,760
can definitely tell if I had listened to

319
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,680
this cuz this came out when I was 18 if

320
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,959
I had heard it when I was 18 uh I

321
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,040
wouldn't have noticed any of the stuff

322
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,360
that I now might be a little irked by

323
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,600
and I probably would have loved the [ __ ]

324
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,920
out of this album yeah it it that's the

325
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,760
thing is that at the time this was I

326
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,440
think this is representative of like The

327
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,120
Cutting Edge of comedy at the time

328
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,639
because I mean this is the alternative

329
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,120
era where it was okay to talk about

330
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,680
weird pop culture stuff which was a

331
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,639
thing that really wasn't in comedy

332
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,839
before I think nearly as much because

333
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,079
everybody was trying to play to the

334
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,000
biggest audience possible this is where

335
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,160
this is where comedians like dug in and

336
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,639
found their particular audience and it

337
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,320
was the same audience of people who

338
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,560
might go

339
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,120
see you know uh who might go see uh

340
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,160
Dinosaur Jr would also be interested in

341
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:23,320
going to see Dana Gould or or uh or

342
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,639
Sarah Silverman or Mark Marin or uh you

343
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:31,040
know whoever uh David Cross in the in

344
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,440
the 90s so I think that uh at the time I

345
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,959
was like oh here's somebody who talks

346
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,240
about things that I also kind of know

347
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,120
about and I mean I'm not I'm not into

348
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,160
monster movies as much as Danny G but I

349
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,040
definitely identifi like he mentions uh

350
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,480
he mentions 9inch Nails in here which is

351
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,720
a band I listen to when I was in high

352
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,800
school and I was like and and for me

353
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,600
that's like oh my God there's a new

354
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,959
generation of comedians who can do uh

355
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,759
who are and it was actually one of the

356
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,600
things that inspired me to do comedy

357
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,120
myself because like oh okay it's okay to

358
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,480
talk about the things that are in my

359
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,360
real life and also it was Progressive

360
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,199
for its time now I know that there's

361
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,880
plenty of stuff in this record that's

362
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,560
that are that's crazy you wouldn't I

363
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,440
mean and he wouldn't do it now but uh

364
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,560
but back then I mean like he's talking

365
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,199
about how he has a gay friend who he's

366
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,519
trying to uh introduce to his parents

367
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,680
and this whole thing where he's trying

368
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,519
to I mean the fact that like he's like

369
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,079
I'm cool with my gay friend but I think

370
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,880
my gay friend should jump back into the

371
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:33,519
closet for when my parents visit is very

372
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,160
much a totally fine thing and good for

373
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,880
you buddy back

374
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,000
in and now it's completely crazy to any

375
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,639
of us you know right yeah and but and

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,600
it's at the very least a bit like that

377
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,880
plays a little more like you can sort of

378
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,839
you can sort of get it uh and honestly

379
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,480
to me my favorite stuff on here is his

380
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,160
most absurd when he gets to the less

381
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,120
honestly the the stuff that's maybe a

382
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,880
little bit less about his actual life

383
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,000
like specifically when he's talking

384
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,759
about uh when he's talking about uh old

385
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,440
ad slogans like the very simple ones

386
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,639
that are very stupid and he about if you

387
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,800
don't like milk try sucking my ass if I

388
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,120
remember it's something that milk enjoy

389
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,680
and if you what do he say milk enjoy it

390
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,519
and if you don't why or oh [ __ ] I can't

391
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,480
remember now but it's like yeah but why

392
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,680
try sucking my ass is the punch line or

393
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,880
why not try sucking my ass

394
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,880
and yeah I I think uh

395
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,199
it was like cheese you [ __ ] or something

396
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,319
like that yeah uh I really I really

397
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:41,759
enjoy that bit I

398
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,839
enjoy uh I enjoy the let's see where

399
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,639
they're doing the the pitches for what

400
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,759
uh what Neil Armstrong is going to say

401
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,880
uh when he steps out to the

402
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,800
Moon uh I think that's great I think

403
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,600
that oh the uh the Vincent Price dating

404
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,600
bit is very

405
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,639
good cuz his impression is so

406
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,279
good right yeah I mean that's that's

407
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,040
another thing that I guess I didn't

408
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,959
expect with him I didn't honestly didn't

409
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,279
expect him to be a voice guy because I'm

410
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,319
realizing now I've seen him on stuff I

411
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,680
know he writes for The Simpsons I don't

412
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,920
know that I've ever heard his comedy

413
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,240
before today people would be like what

414
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,480
are you doing was like obviously I

415
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,519
listen to a bunch of old [ __ ] so uh I'm

416
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,120
still catching up so I guess I didn't

417
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,480
expect the voice stuff yeah it's funny

418
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,920
that and I don't think I thought too

419
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,199
much of it at the time either but doing

420
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,440
impressions I think it used to be more

421
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,240
common to do a ton of Impressions and

422
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,600
now I feel like you're either I feel

423
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
like you're either an impression guy or

424
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,880
not I feel like you're either James

425
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,160
Adomian or your or you're somebody who

426
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,480
completely doesn't ever do Impressions

427
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,319
uh and and Dana G is kind of this hybrid

428
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,800
where he's he's doing regular you know

429
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:55,440
classic standup stuff about like

430
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,199
relationships and his parents and his

431
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,759
his regular life or whatever and then

432
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,240
he's also going into a fantasy place

433
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,360
where he's doing impressions of actual

434
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,760
celebrities or a lot of his bits have

435
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,319
like a real act out uh uh sense to them

436
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,360
where he's like acting out a scene and

437
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,520
he's really going for it I like how

438
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,919
Earnest he is and that he's and that he

439
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,240
uh he performs these bits for

440
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,880
real yeah I feel like that's the kind of

441
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,199
being the ham that I am like if I were

442
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,400
to do standup which will probably never

443
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,640
happen uh that would be where I would

444
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,440
fall because in conversation I find

445
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,960
myself doing voices

446
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,640
whether people want to hear them or not

447
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,919
so I I wonder if he's that kind of guy

448
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,440
in conversation too strikes me as it

449
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,919
though he might be I'll bet that he is

450
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
and I'll bet that he's a real talker I

451
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,480
mean he has a he has his own podcast

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,480
called The Dana Gould hour and it's

453
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,360
three hours long uh first of all woof

454
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,280
holy [ __ ] and it's him he only puts it

455
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,160
out once a month so uh but it's but he

456
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
talks to it's kind of like he weaves

457
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,799
together different interviews that he's

458
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,760
recorded at different time so they kind

459
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,880
of jump back and forth with like some

460
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,520
intertial music and then he does some

461
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,080
monologuing and he has like a little

462
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,120
comedy bit that he does with John Enis

463
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,280
for Mr show where they're like two guys

464
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,320
from Boston uh chatting about whatever

465
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,159
um so he does a lot of yeah he's doing

466
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,760
like a Boston voice in that too I mean

467
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,039
he's from Massachusetts but he really

468
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,760
hams up the Boston accent for some bits

469
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,320
that he does um but yeah it was going

470
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,720
back to what you said earlier though it

471
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,400
is interesting that like his sensibility

472
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,640
of these of old timey movie culture and

473
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,320
uh and monster movies and stuff like

474
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,559
Planet of the Apes and stuff like seeps

475
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,840
into uh The Simpsons which he wrote on

476
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,400
for you know something like 10 or a

477
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,840
dozen years or something up until just a

478
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,000
few years ago and then he went out and

479
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,880
now he makes his own show on uh on uh

480
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,600
what do you call uh I don't it's not a

481
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,640
it's

482
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,840
uh IFC on IFC he makes a show on IFC

483
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,159
called stand against evil which is oh

484
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,039
I'm an idiot I've seen that show and

485
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,520
it's delightful yeah he's the the series

486
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,760
Creator in the writer for that show

487
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,360
basically and he and he plays

488
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,400
interestingly because he talks about I

489
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,559
actually Haven seen the show so you got

490
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,080
one up on me there it's it's not bad I I

491
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,559
like a I mean I watched it for Janet

492
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,880
Varney who I adore she's so much fun to

493
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,720
watch and John McGinley sure and it's

494
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,960
it's fun and Dana G plays a character on

495
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,240
there who's who's I mean he's just the

496
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,919
uh what do you call it he's the grounds

497
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,320
Keeper at the at the cemetery oh okay

498
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,919
and so he gets to play the old creepy

499
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,480
guy which kind of he talks about on this

500
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,960
album too except he talks about him at

501
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,520
the dump the eyed guy at the dumpy the

502
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,720
dump that's always the you know there's

503
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,799
this there's this weird thing of

504
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,159
specificity in comedy that is clearly

505
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,840
specific only to you but you you're good

506
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,120
enough to suck the audience in so

507
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,760
they're like yeah of course there yeah

508
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,200
there's always that guy one eye at the

509
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,440
dump like everybody laughs at that

510
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,120
specificity as though they know it and

511
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,799
they're like no I'm I'm I'm along for

512
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,120
the ride because it clearly is important

513
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,000
to you I I never went to the dump as a

514
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,880
kid I didn't have we had we had I lived

515
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,039
in the suburbs but we had garbage pickup

516
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,559
at our house

517
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,320
so never had to go to the dump I do

518
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,080
notice that he qualifies it before he

519
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:13,200
says he he says here's a thing that uh

520
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:16,000
that only men who grew up in the suburbs

521
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,280
will understand ahuh and he says that

522
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
and obviously he gets the whole room

523
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,840
anyway but uh but it's interesting that

524
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,600
he qualifies that and that I mean it

525
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,640
maybe things were different when he was

526
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,120
growing up versus maybe garbage pickup

527
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,280
to your suburban home was not a thing

528
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,559
until 15 years later when I was a kid I

529
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,520
don't

530
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,360
know yeah it's very funny I again and I

531
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,559
you wonder how much of that specificity

532
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,960
is like let's see what I can get people

533
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,440
to agree with like just as an

534
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,120
experiment uh how about your standup I

535
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,120
mean like how what's what's your ratio I

536
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,159
don't expect an actual math bit bit of

537
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,400
math what's your ratio actual personal

538
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,960
sh to not uh yeah you mean like uh

539
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,159
personal like stories about myself

540
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,720
versus just bits about the world uh in

541
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:08,200
general I would say it's about half and

542
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,159
half okay u i I find that the doing the

543
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,440
personal bits where you talk about your

544
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,120
real life or or things that are

545
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,520
introductory to hey this is these are

546
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
things about me that you should know

547
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,080
which is going to help the rest of my

548
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,000
standup set like I frontload a lot of

549
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,880
stuff about my life right at the

550
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,799
beginning and then that way uh it's like

551
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,960
people are used to who I am and then I

552
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:32,559
can take them on trip anywhere else I

553
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,640
guess uh and talk about just things from

554
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,559
my point of view that are just stuff

555
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,000
that I talk about like I do you know uh

556
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:44,919
you know things about things about like

557
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,520
jobs I've had and uh I don't know um and

558
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:47,880
then yeah I would say I would say

559
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,400
something like half and half it might go

560
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,919
back and forth between things and it uh

561
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,000
and also it depends like sometimes you

562
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,039
don't want to do uh a ton of personal

563
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,640
stuff and and sometimes with an audience

564
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:04,640
that is not necessarily there for comedy

565
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,360
like if you get on a yeah you know I've

566
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,600
done shows where it's like somebody asks

567
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,960
you hey can you come and do five minutes

568
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,840
on this show and it's some kind of a

569
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,720
dinner and there's a local politician

570
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,720
speaking and then uh they're going to

571
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,799
eat and then then a band's going to play

572
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,720
later and for some reason I've figured

573
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,159
out how to squeeze comedy into this

574
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,240
thing and and by the way I'm paying you

575
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,600
a dinner and uh these people don't know

576
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,039
you for the these people didn't even

577
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,240
know they were there was going to be

578
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,919
comedy on the bill they just knew about

579
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,200
a free meal or they're friends with this

580
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,640
politician or whatever or supporters and

581
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,640
then and then you have to go in there

582
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,240
and it's like surprise it's comedy and

583
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,480
you're trying to get like a bunch of

584
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,960
people with like chicken in their mouths

585
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,600
to pay attention to you and right uh and

586
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,159
in those cases it's it's less fruitful

587
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,080
to be like let's talk about me you

588
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,000
sometimes you just have to go for the

589
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,640
broad stuff or the or maybe even like

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,520
more pop cultur stuff where you can try

591
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,039
and find common ground with people in a

592
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,159
really short period of time there's not

593
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,240
a lot of other art forms I don't think

594
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:16,799
where you have to necessarily for time

595
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,440
or for audience uh cut down go from like

596
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,919
lengthy art piece to pop art piece like

597
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,880
you can do it in other art forms like

598
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,320
music but it's not that often stand Up's

599
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,120
one of those that's so adaptable uh that

600
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,960
you just have to be like oh no this this

601
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,200
entire piece of this thing that I might

602
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,080
consider my art I have to excise for the

603
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
sake of these weirdos in this audience

604
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,320
yeah it's true you really do it's and

605
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,679
when

606
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,880
I uh you know considering your the

607
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,480
audience you're in and especially in the

608
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,600
place where I am like I've been doing

609
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,000
comedy for six years now uh doing stand

610
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,120
up for six years I've been hosting

611
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,720
comedy shows for five years you know

612
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,080
I've been on the radio for three years

613
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,679
whatever uh but you know at a we're

614
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,200
still at a point and I'm still in sort

615
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,440
of a region where uh where you're going

616
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,559
where where it's not like you have these

617
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,919
big sets of fans or a huge audience

618
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,279
who's coming out to see just you so you

619
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,279
have to reintroduce yourself to people

620
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,039
almost every time you go on and yeah so

621
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,400
you're never a known quantity like I

622
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:21,120
assume that Danny G is doing this show

623
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,320
uh this his first comedy record he's

624
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,480
doing it like friends of his are in the

625
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,720
audience or people know him around town

626
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,760
he's in La he at this point he's

627
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,640
probably already been he has been on TV

628
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,559
doing stuff uh you know he's written for

629
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,399
TV he's been in sketch comedy stuff

630
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,279
whatever and so he's you know he's a

631
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:42,360
he's sort of a known person and people

632
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:45,200
kind of know what to expect when they're

633
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,520
going to see him and that's not the case

634
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
when people come to see me on a show for

635
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,159
the most part for the most part I mean

636
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,039
it's stuff that I do every week people

637
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,399
understand that people listen to the

638
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,520
radio show understand that but when I go

639
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:57,440
out there and do some standup gig that

640
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,279
somebody booked me on then you have to

641
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,520
you have to decide you know oh this

642
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,760
thing that I love this sort of you know

643
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,799
artier piece like you're saying uh that

644
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,000
has like some sort of a message that I'm

645
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,840
trying to put out there like about me or

646
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,480
about the world or about something that

647
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,279
I think that about a deeply held

648
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,080
personal belief or whatever sometimes

649
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:22,000
that stuff falls to the Wayside just for

650
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,679
the sake of survival in a semih hostile

651
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,919
environment you know right do you think

652
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,640
most people okay so I don't know the

653
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,960
sales numbers on an album like this but

654
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
let's assume they were good enough for

655
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,399
him to keep going as a person and as a

656
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,039
as a comedian and make another album uh

657
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,000
do you think the people who are familiar

658
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,279
with him

659
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,120
feel familiar with him or feel familiar

660
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,799
with this is a guy who has made me laugh

661
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,120
before do you think there is actually as

662
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,720
much as we give uh credit to this idea

663
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,120
that hey they they should know something

664
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,600
about me they should be comfortable with

665
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,360
me familiar with me as you say you've

666
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,039
got to do Exposition and which I imagine

667
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,880
is also funny Exposition which is a

668
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:59,720
challenge right but then you've got

669
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,200
somebody like him who's like I've seen

670
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,480
you a bunch you've never made me cringe

671
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,520
or you have made me laugh every time

672
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,760
therefore I'm familiar with that rather

673
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,919
than I'm familiar with you even

674
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,240
subconsciously from your material like I

675
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,760
wonder what the majority of people knew

676
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,320
him from uh by the time you know maybe

677
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,159
his next album comes out like do you

678
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,640
have any perspective on that because I'm

679
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,720
I'm just curious because do you really

680
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,360
need to make people know who you are and

681
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,000
give a [ __ ] who you are or is it a

682
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,279
matter of I've seen you be funny before

683
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,399
that's enough for me uh I think I think

684
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:35,320
it's probably more the latter uh I I I

685
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:37,720
don't I I I think that if I don't think

686
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,159
people have to be like oh I haven't seen

687
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,960
Dana Gold's standup in particular

688
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,039
therefore I'm not sure I want to go see

689
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,159
him do standup you know what you do you

690
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:50,159
find and I and this is what happens like

691
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,399
uh the The Comedy Club Circuit even the

692
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,200
the best rooms or whatever they're uh

693
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:57,039
they're bringing around people who

694
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,559
mostly people who are known from TV in

695
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,840
some way now now some of those people

696
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:06,360
started out as professional standups and

697
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:09,120
then got on TV like uh Danny Gould uh or

698
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,600
some and then some of those people were

699
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,279
TV people in in comedy on television in

700
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,399
some way but were never stand-ups and

701
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,440
had to learn it because they had the

702
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:20,399
opportunity to go on the road because

703
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,720
you can sell tickets for somebody that

704
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,960
people are familiar with on TV or or who

705
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,840
have been in the movies or something

706
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,799
like that like you know like steo from

707
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,960
Jackass he was never a up but he

708
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:35,600
literally does Comedy Club stand

709
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,000
upes

710
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,640
tours and you know much to the sugarin

711
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,120
of of many Comics who wish that you know

712
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,200
that that it was you know for the art of

713
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,760
it or whatever but yeah people go see

714
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,720
steo they don't care they don't care if

715
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,080
they've seen him tell jokes

716
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,399
before yeah that's a good point that's

717
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
the weirdest [ __ ] that I've ever heard

718
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,960
now like I've seen people say hey look

719
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,840
Jake the Snake Roberts is at a club and

720
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,279
but like it's clear that oh he's telling

721
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,919
stories from his wrestling days he's

722
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,519
necessarily doing standup I guess but he

723
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,360
is getting booked in standup clubs which

724
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,640
is [ __ ] weird right yeah it's the

725
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,519
same kind of it's it's a it's similar

726
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,120
although I'd rather see uh Jake The

727
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:14,360
Snake or uh whatever mankind or whatever

728
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,840
I'd rather see I'd rather see them than

729
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,240
I than than steo who yes who wasn't I

730
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,240
mean the thing about wrestlers is

731
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,799
wrestlers are professional talkers as

732
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,480
much as they are athletes so you know

733
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,760
like and he's a guy who's like I've been

734
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,760
hitting the balls a bunch hi that's like

735
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,200
what else like else they've done

736
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,360
presentational things into microphones

737
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,279
whereas steo was a just a maniac you

738
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,200
know lighting fireworks out of his butt

739
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,480
uh you know snorting Wasabi or whatever

740
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,240
but he wasn't they weren't they they

741
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,120
never had to learn to talk and get

742
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
laughs or anything the laughs are the

743
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,039
it's completely physical comedy so like

744
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,159
and then steo I guess when he I haven't

745
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,840
seen this but he's been to my town many

746
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,440
times I have not attended I apologize

747
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,919
if you're out there listening but but uh

748
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,080
but I understand that he does a couple

749
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,919
of like stunts that you can do inside of

750
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,880
a the because he's also like a Prof he's

751
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:13,840
also a clown he went to the cloud

752
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,519
college that I did not know he's yeah

753
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,919
he's a real de clown that steo uh he

754
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,720
went to the ringland brothers clown

755
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,399
college and so I guess he's got he's got

756
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,120
physical stuff that he can do on stage

757
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,200
but then but then I guess the rest of it

758
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,880
is one time we were on the set of

759
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,039
Jackass and we did blah blah blah

760
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,159
or whatever I you

761
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,080
know yeah see that's weird to me it's

762
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,240
like uh it's like it's oh hey it's the

763
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,600
30s and we got this circus geek who's

764
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,519
out of work he he used to eat the heads

765
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,960
off of chickens uh he wants to perform

766
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,080
now uh you got any you know bits you can

767
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,640
write for this guy right and really I

768
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,640
mean you'd have to all his bits Would S

769
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,200
surround uh eating the heads off of

770
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,720
chickens that would be everything you'd

771
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,279
have most of the bits

772
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,200
yeah you ever seen one of these chickens

773
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,279
chickens am I right you see him they're

774
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,640
out in the

775
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:04,399
yard too much uh they say they can run

776
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,360
around with their heads cut off uh I had

777
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,399
to test that theory once uh but I didn't

778
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,519
have an axe around so I bit its head off

779
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,799
I bit it head off you know yep that's

780
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,279
and then that's that's all it is I

781
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,799
almost delivered that Norm McDonald

782
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,360
style and I apologize I'm stealing that

783
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,640
from my buddy Allen who does a very good

784
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,799
fake nor McDonald joke his I love nor

785
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,720
McDonald so much oh it's it's hard not

786
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,760
to like nor McDonald he's still good and

787
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,200
I don't get it yeah uh there are a lot

788
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,399
of guys in his generation who have aged

789
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,320
out already because he's because he's

790
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:35,159
also kind of a dinosaur in his beliefs

791
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,919
or whatever well Dana Gould has remained

792
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,360
a p a questioning a seeking person who

793
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:45,120
sure uh who does still like to push it

794
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,159
but has figured out but but also wants

795
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,320
to do well in the room and has retired I

796
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,279
mean I'm sure he retired these bits

797
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,960
anyway because he wrote new material and

798
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,880
started he actually took a huge break

799
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,320
from standup working on The Simpsons and

800
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,720
having a family and stuff and then came

801
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,720
back to it like the last five six seven

802
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,720
years and uh and put out like two or

803
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,159
three more albums which are also very

804
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,039
good um which are very good and very and

805
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,600
much more modern you you can see you can

806
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,760
see the difference it's not a situation

807
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,159
where it's like you know like Tim Allen

808
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,480
is out here you know uh The Last Man

809
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,679
Standing or

810
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,600
whatever uh Danny gold has has remained

811
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,720
a person who whose thoughts have evolved

812
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,840
on a lot of these issues I've heard him

813
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,240
talk about how he would not like for

814
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,200
example there is a there's the huge use

815
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,679
of the RW in this uh in this album uh

816
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,399
and you can tell that like that's the

817
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,399
culture that he comes from yeah uh where

818
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,840
you just say that nobody cares and who

819
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,639
cares it and he realized at some point

820
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,639
that that was hurtful I listened to him

821
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:51,120
he was on an episode of the of the

822
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:53,919
Jordan Jesse go podcast in like maybe

823
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,639
2009 2010 something like that like way

824
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,679
back when they were new and that's like

825
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:58,639
a long time ago now and he talked to

826
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,000
that

827
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,519
about how about how he realized that

828
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,240
that word was hurting people and people

829
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,200
enough people talked to him and then he

830
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,639
and then he stopped doing it like he

831
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,039
won't do like people would request that

832
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:13,639
bit and he would he wouldn't do it

833
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:15,080
anymore well and I that's I mean that's

834
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:16,399
I would say the minimum you could ask

835
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,639
most people don't meet that minimum but

836
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,080
I'm glad that he does like I I he's one

837
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:23,000
of and I kind of assumed when you and I

838
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,600
got to talking about this that I would

839
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,200
that that would he just strikes me as

840
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,159
that kind of guy where he would be like

841
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,480
uh well maybe because especially listen

842
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,720
to the number of things in this album

843
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,760
that are trying to portray him he's

844
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,600
trying to portray himself as an

845
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,639
open-minded dude sure he is yes so and I

846
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,720
mean you either do that because you're

847
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:41,519
actually a monster or because you're

848
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,639
trying to point out hey I'm on the side

849
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,480
of probably several people in this room

850
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:48,039
I don't want you to think I I I have any

851
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,120
hate in my heart uh you know and so and

852
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,919
I don't think the bits are hateful as

853
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,880
much as they are ignorant ignorant of

854
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,880
the idea that there is somebody like

855
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,880
because I think I think the old Theory

856
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,880
with the RW in particular which I'm not

857
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,760
even going to say we know the one the

858
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,760
the ableist

859
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,240
slur uh you know I I think that it used

860
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,760
to be like well where's the victim of

861
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,399
this crime because that person's there's

862
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,960
none of those people in this room or

863
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,639
something like that and and maybe and

864
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,240
maybe because of their uh because of uh

865
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,240
of their disability they might not

866
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,480
understand that you're making fun of

867
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,600
them anyway blah blah blah that kind of

868
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,440
stuff which is horrible like like that's

869
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,720
not like that's the old way of thinking

870
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,399
about things which is a bad way to think

871
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,600
about things which I completely reject I

872
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,080
just want to go on the record and say

873
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,120
that I do think that Dana G is probably

874
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,919
one of those people who just didn't

875
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,159
realize and because of the culture that

876
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,159
he comes from like and nobody told him

877
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,200
or who knows what he had thought it all

878
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,360
the way through that that guess what

879
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,679
there's also people who are who have

880
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,960
friends and who have family members who

881
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,279
are uh who have are disabled and then

882
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,200
also that uh just general people out in

883
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:10,399
the world think that it's not

884
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,440
nice to to to punch down and and uh and

885
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,040
I think at some point he probably

886
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,320
figured it out and now he doesn't he

887
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,839
doesn't do any stuff like that so what's

888
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,639
what's interesting is he leans into the

889
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:23,079
word he starts out doing a bit where

890
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,200
that the word is almost used clinically

891
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,800
uh because he's talking about somebody

892
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,599
do I can't remember what the bit is oh

893
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,839
that D he's saying that his his dad

894
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,480
would point out he's like every town has

895
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,599
a town uh person who is disabled let's

896
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,359
say and which is which sounds which also

897
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,440
is a weird old he comes from a small

898
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:45,599
town so maybe yes yeah so and then his

899
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,679
dad when they were driving would point

900
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,839
out to his mom oh there's your boyfriend

901
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,679
pointing to that person which is a

902
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,919
horrible thing and he was pointing out

903
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,640
as his dad being shitty yes yeah so so

904
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,400
he's on the side of not making fun of

905
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:06,480
that guy in that way but then he goes on

906
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:10,920
to and then he uses a and then he uses a

907
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,560
uh a a voice yes he does oh boy and

908
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,640
that's and that's really the bit that's

909
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
that's the bit that he refuses to do

910
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,760
ever

911
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,920
now for sure is that like because he and

912
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,119
he said people used to ask for it and he

913
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,960
where it was the the bit where he's

914
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,320
where he's saying that um that wouldn't

915
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,079
it be terrible or like it's like a if an

916
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,400
intolerant person

917
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:39,960
suddenly uh became mentally disabled

918
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,400
or uh you know then uh and then they

919
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,240
were upset about it and then he acts it

920
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,520
out yeah and it's isn't it what if you

921
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,800
woke up and it was like your Just

922
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,599
Desserts order but then but the the pr

923
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,920
the the the the supposition of that bit

924
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,960
is that the the the premise is oh

925
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,520
wouldn't it be horrible to be a disabled

926
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,520
person yes like a fate worse than death

927
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,480
basically right and uh that's not cool

928
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,680
no no and it's weird because the the

929
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,760
perfect irony there is like hey I'm

930
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,000
trying to be open-minded here right and

931
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,960
at the same time the only way I can

932
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,680
display it is through this other set of

933
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,319
ignorant suppositions that I've just got

934
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,280
built into my brain yeah and I you know

935
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:24,079
I do respect people working past it um

936
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,720
you know and I cuz I try so hard like

937
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:31,319
not to be well I don't try not to be a

938
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:34,200
out of hand or whatever uh I am a bough

939
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:37,640
in a lot of yeah it really is it really

940
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,800
is uh espe you know I mean I've given a

941
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,400
little more uh you know leeway to people

942
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,160
who are not Bill Cosby and Woody Allen

943
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,640
you know what I'm saying like they

944
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,119
unfortunately have set this standard of

945
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,520
low as people where it's like okay well

946
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,640
your material is not great but you

947
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,480
you're not that guy so I'll give you a

948
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
chance to evolve and again it sounds

949
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
like Dana g g has evolved like pretty

950
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,319
pretty properly and that's the thing

951
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,880
like and and it's and the and the reason

952
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:03,319
I picked this album is because it was

953
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,240
part of my sort of my formative time

954
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:07,800
thinking about standup comedy and I I

955
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,680
knew this guy from the 80s and 90s like

956
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,200
like like doing doing clean material on

957
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,839
TV I mean none of this stuff would have

958
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,880
ever made it on TV that we're talking uh

959
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:19,119
even at the time I I don't think I don't

960
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,400
think anybody was was running around

961
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:27,880
with with the with the RW on TV even

962
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,359
right and uh and I think that uh and

963
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,280
then there's just so much of it that is

964
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:37,480
very inventive and and creative and

965
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,560
has uh and just the kind of the fantasy

966
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,880
world that he's building or the sort of

967
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,440
uh the the attention to detail like the

968
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,160
uh like the answering machine bit uhuh

969
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,599
which is where where he's where where

970
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,319
he's analyzing a a message on an an

971
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,920
answering for those of you who are too

972
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:58,240
young an answering

973
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,040
machine was like a box that had

974
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,520
voicemail in it that was attached to

975
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:06,560
your phone in your own home and it was

976
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:10,440
recorded on a small cassette tape

977
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,960
uh you know there's a sorry go ahead no

978
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,200
uh but but yeah but he does this bit

979
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,800
where he's where he's uh trying to where

980
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,560
he gets a a voicemail from an

981
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,880
ex-girlfriend and it's very quick and

982
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,680
vague and then he starts analyzing it

983
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,440
and he does sound effects he's like

984
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,079
Winslow he's doing he's doing sound

985
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,079
effects with his mouth only that are of

986
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,920
him playing the tape back and rewinding

987
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,960
the tape the sound of the tape rewinding

988
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,599
the sound of the button being pushed

989
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,760
again uh and he's he's got a

990
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,920
masterful uh faculty with with that kind

991
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,760
of stuff I kind of respect that in terms

992
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,079
of like I again here's where I become a

993
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,680
grandpa I wish a lot of uh artists and

994
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,920
things that that became famous had maybe

995
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,560
a little bit more of a background in

996
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,400
things other than whatever they become

997
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,520
famous for you know like there used to

998
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,400
be this cool thing where you could be a

999
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,200
triple threat or at the very least Jim

1000
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,319
Neighbors who play this fraking idiot

1001
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,480
hick could also sing like an angel uh

1002
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:13,599
where it's just like it's always fun to

1003
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,680
be surprised by people and you know I

1004
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,280
kind of respect like any I'm okay with a

1005
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,880
com comedian who can also play guitar

1006
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,480
doesn't bother me I'm also like super

1007
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,680
cool if you can do a good sound effect

1008
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,160
like if you could do it well why not do

1009
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,839
it cuz it does lend something to it I

1010
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,200
think so and I and I think that that's

1011
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:32,319
imp I I feel like people would be

1012
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,760
impressed today I think that there's

1013
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,960
things have swung and and maybe they're

1014
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,359
maybe they're starting to swing again

1015
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,480
and we're starting to get more silly

1016
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,960
which I hope uh is true and I and I have

1017
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,200
felt and honestly I feel like it's held

1018
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,920
me back in a certain way because I would

1019
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,640
like to be more like Dana Gould I would

1020
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,440
like to be doing more crazy act outs or

1021
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,599
weird sound effects or sing or or any of

1022
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,079
the any of the things that that he's

1023
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,319
doing um that are more performative and

1024
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,200
less just talking and I think that there

1025
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:09,920
there was a turn maybe in the last

1026
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,480
starting maybe 10 years ago or something

1027
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,440
where the the turn was away from uh away

1028
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,760
from uh Dan

1029
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,920
Cook and the like and it was a turn

1030
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:28,079
toward uh you know uh that that other

1031
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:33,280
monster Louis CK um and and people in

1032
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:36,560
the premium was put on a person

1033
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,560
speaking uh sort of seamlessly

1034
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,359
conversationally sounding only about

1035
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:46,680
their actual life and sort of uh this

1036
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,880
sort of verit thing uh where where where

1037
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,680
the premium was on 100% authenticity and

1038
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,440
honesty and I am exactly the person that

1039
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,920
you see on stage offstage and that's

1040
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,000
what we've all been talking about for

1041
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,359
the last 10 years and I think that there

1042
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,640
is and that and that back in the late

1043
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,440
80s early 90s things had gotten a little

1044
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,839
crazy with

1045
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,760
everybody uh with everybody doing this

1046
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,640
sort of canned hacky stuff and the

1047
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,280
whatever oversaturation and airplane

1048
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,200
food and everything that everybody

1049
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,240
complains about that time and then there

1050
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,400
was a swing for the alternative stuff in

1051
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,760
the 90s and the alternative stuff was a

1052
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,599
swing towards absurdism

1053
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,839
right uh and I and I feel like what I

1054
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,079
feel like we could really at this point

1055
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:39,440
I think I'm I'm sick of everybody to a

1056
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,640
certain extent uh only doing this stuff

1057
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,680
that that

1058
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,599
is uh that is this is my life and it's

1059
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,480
gritty and it's dark and there's a place

1060
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,280
for all of that stuff but I'm kind of

1061
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,560
over it at this point and I've heard

1062
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,119
I've been listening to it and I've been

1063
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,359
hearing it in rooms and everybody wants

1064
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:00,240
to do it still and I'm kind of uh I'm

1065
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,920
kind of looking for some for some silly

1066
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,400
stuff or some uh short jokes I mean like

1067
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,480
whatever happened to like Steven right

1068
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,400
uh things of that nature and what

1069
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,280
happened to uh what happened or like uh

1070
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,920
I mean another big influence on me at

1071
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,119
the same time that this Dana G album

1072
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,960
came out was that uh maybe in

1073
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,559
2000ish was that Eddie isard Dressed to

1074
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,520
Kill special oh God damn it that's such

1075
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,200
a good [ __ ] special it's one of the

1076
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,400
best like if that was an album on vinyl

1077
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,280
I might have picked that one just

1078
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,440
because it' be so much fun to talk about

1079
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,880
like I could it's it it's so quotable

1080
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,800
like you can my sister and I still talk

1081
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,040
back and forth uh in that language of it

1082
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,200
it's you know I think it's fun I think

1083
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,240
it's funny he's a mass murdering

1084
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,319
[ __ ] yeah yeah uh in a ditch coved

1085
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,079
petrol on

1086
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,319
fire uh yeah that's that's also one that

1087
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,319
I shared with my sister as well uh it's

1088
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:56,640
a that's a God damn it if there's any

1089
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:58,920
way we can ever swing talking about

1090
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,400
Eddie as on the podcast uh I'll have you

1091
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,599
on because I could do that forever oh

1092
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,839
yeah oh please I would love to and yeah

1093
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,680
and that I mean that special and we were

1094
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,720
watching Mr show which was which was

1095
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,760
super weird and absurd and the sketches

1096
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,880
didn't make much logical sense a lot of

1097
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,040
the time or like here's a weird exercise

1098
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,599
and we're just going to have this guy

1099
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,079
knock over these Thimbles again and

1100
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,559
again and again for no reason you know

1101
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:26,040
yeah right yeah what's what's your

1102
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:31,400
position on and you be as honest as you

1103
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:35,359
like on Carrot Top ah Carrot Top

1104
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,800
I I think that Carrot Top has been doing

1105
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,280
his Carrot Top thing and that he you

1106
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,599
know and they used to make fun of Carrot

1107
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,640
Top on Mr

1108
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,640
Show they did they called they had a

1109
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,079
character on Carrot Top on Mr show

1110
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,119
called blueberry head it was a it was an

1111
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:54,040
extremely not disguised um stupid God

1112
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,240
reference yeah blueberry head my

1113
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,640
God holy [ __ ] uh so I think I was

1114
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,119
trained to hate Carrot Top and I was

1115
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,640
trained to hate prop comedy in that age

1116
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:07,440
and that there was like it wasn't cool

1117
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,920
and there was something about the 90s

1118
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,960
and the alternative boom there was

1119
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,359
something about jinnie Garo and uh and

1120
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,680
David Cross and and Danny gold and these

1121
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:20,640
people that uh where it wasn't it wasn't

1122
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,800
cool to have props it it wasn't it

1123
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,200
wasn't cool to be overly it was like it

1124
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,640
was like they could do their little

1125
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,240
absurdism and their and their

1126
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,880
you know they they're whatever and they

1127
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,559
I don't care stuff but I think that like

1128
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,599
the the appearance of somebody trying

1129
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,599
that hard and putting on an old timey

1130
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,400
show basically because K toop is putting

1131
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,760
on like an old timey Vaudeville act or

1132
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,640
something basically it's like that's

1133
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,400
that's the tradition of it um I haven't

1134
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,559
seen so much katop material recently

1135
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,760
that I couldn't I mean like I haven't

1136
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,680
been to vas and seen his the show that

1137
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,119
he's installed doing but I'll I'll I'll

1138
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,760
bet you you go see that show and laugh

1139
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,119
that's all I've heard and everybody says

1140
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,359
he's a very nice dude uh so yeah it's

1141
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,480
really weird to me cuz I I when I was a

1142
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,400
kid I love the [ __ ] out of them and then

1143
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,319
I also fell for the cynicism of the 90s

1144
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,720
where I'm like you I shouldn't like you

1145
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,400
and then I hear people like no I went

1146
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,440
and saw katop and he was fine he was

1147
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,920
funny he made me laugh he's also a very

1148
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,040
nice guy and it's like well I have to

1149
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,520
reconsider now because you know I just

1150
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,319
dismissed him out of hand and then

1151
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,720
forgot how much I loved him as a kid now

1152
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,480
it might be super cheesy it's not going

1153
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,960
to be deep we're not we're not getting

1154
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,680
any levels here I don't think but no

1155
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:36,079
it's it's it's it's visual puns mhm

1156
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,920
right I mean and and it like he I

1157
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,200
remember hearing him uh interviewed on

1158
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,079
like WTF and he talked about how his

1159
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,880
like you know he just went to an open

1160
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,319
mic and he he had brought like a like a

1161
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,000
road sign that he had found and then he

1162
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:50,720
altered it in some way to make a joke

1163
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,440
out of it and that all of his other

1164
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,000
jokes bound but people like the road

1165
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,800
sign and then like the the club manager

1166
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,280
the booker whoever said you should come

1167
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,920
back but you should do more of that

1168
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,640
stuff and then he built his act that way

1169
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,359
wow [ __ ] it's crazy like how how you

1170
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,040
hear these stories from a certain period

1171
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,079
where like the you know the the club

1172
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,160

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,640
um really if if you could if you could

1180
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,079
look kind of like a genie so that people

1181
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,559
will remember you so people will make up

1182
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,720
a genie movie in their head you don't

1183
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:31,880
actually start in that would be perfect

1184
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,359
um oh my God it never occurred to me it

1185
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,559
was the pants that that made people

1186
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,359
think that oh it's the P it's the P it's

1187
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,760
it's his clothes he all you do you put

1188
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:43,119
the you put the racist turban on his

1189
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,800
head and he's a gen he's a he's he's

1190
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:49,000
he's basically Robin Williams and

1191
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:51,160
Aladdin um so but what I was gonna Oh

1192
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,200
shoot what was I gonna say I'm sorry it

1193
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,520
doesn't

1194
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,040
matter it's just

1195
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,079
words can I tell you speak of words my

1196
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,119
favorite line on this it's so dumb it's

1197
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:02,440
so dumb but him talking about and again

1198
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,440
it it also comes from I would say

1199
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,640
something that maybe he has a little

1200
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,359
more perspective on but he's talking

1201
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,319
about uh not doing well financially uh

1202
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,680
but he does talk about living above a

1203
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:13,720
sex shop and basically subsisting off of

1204
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,839
day old chocolate [ __ ] and that was

1205
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,839
really funny yeah D old chocolate [ __ ]

1206
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,280
is a is a great phrase and then he's

1207
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:22,079
like then he talks about having to eat

1208
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,200
them and he's

1209
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,800
like you can just you can just see you

1210
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,240
know the act out of it and uh

1211
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,520
in your head from the from the noises

1212
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,640
he's kind of making in protest you know

1213
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,559
because it's like this should be food

1214
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,520
you know um I enjoyed that yeah he was a

1215
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:43,240
he was one of those he he

1216
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,960
moved to uh San Francisco and and built

1217
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,280
up his act there before eventually

1218
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,000
moving to La for I think TV

1219
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,680
jobs that's crazy and what's interesting

1220
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,160
to me is uh I don't know if I'll ever

1221
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,960
get him on the show uh but if I do I I

1222
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,680
realize the first thing I ever saw him

1223
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,960
in or noticed who he was uh he plays a

1224
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,280
sandwich delivery guy in uh my fellow

1225
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,040
Americans starring Jack Lemon and James

1226
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,440
Garner I've seen that movie but I don't

1227
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,839
remember that at all yeah he's just

1228
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,559
delivering a sandwich it's like and then

1229
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:14,160
he gets arrested uh that's it he's got

1230
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,960
like two lines in the whole thing

1231
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,440
they're are they both former presidents

1232
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,680
in that movie both former presidents and

1233
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,800
they're both on the run I still love it

1234
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,599

Smart movie with Steve Carell and he

1238
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,040
literally steals one of his own jokes

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,640
from from my fellow Americans and puts

1240
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,559

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,760
American so it's so it's kind of like

1245
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,559
well you know like like I didn't get I

1246
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,559
didn't I I didn't squeeze this one for

1247
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,920
all it was worth yet but it's it's it's

1248
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,160
got prew

1249
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,160
westwing in the White House Bradley

1250
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,680
Whitford uh Bradley looks like a guy who

1251
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,440
works in the white it's true he's in I'm

1252
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,040
going to guess his only scene ever with

1253
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,200
Wilford Brimley uh they both have

1254
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,200
reversed initials I just realized that

1255
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,040
uh Wilford Brimley tortures Bradley

1256
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,880
Whitford in a movie I like how that's

1257
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,319
super notable in my brain it is I can't

1258
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,000
I was like why am I connecting them in

1259
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:17,720
my oh wbw there we go that makes sense

1260
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,760
uh of course that's why they that's why

1261
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,760
they cast them of course it is that's

1262
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,160
how all casting in movies bradfield's in

1263
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,440
the in the casting office with other

1264
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,040
bws we just need a we need the right W

1265
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,760
to be opposite

1266
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,920
WB I oh man honestly it's a movie I

1267
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,079
don't I won't recommend people revisit

1268
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,799
it because it's probably just my

1269
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:41,680
Nostalgia flavoring it but I love it and

1270
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:43,520
I still it still makes me laugh I saw it

1271
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,200
when it came out that's a mid 90s movie

1272
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,280
mid to late 90s yep so there you go

1273
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,400
there's there's Dan G trying to make it

1274
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,200
he's one of those guys who who did pilot

1275
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,960
season like X number of years in a row

1276
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,200
and none of the shows it shot a bunch of

1277
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,160
pilots and none of them ever went to

1278
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,880
series he thought he was going to be a

1279
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,359
he thought it was going to be a

1280
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,400
household name and it never quite

1281
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,839
happened uh kind of like what happened

1282
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,799
with Dave Chappelle except Dave

1283
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:10,760
Chappelle went on to have a Smash It SE

1284
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:12,839
sketch show yeah I can't imagine Dave

1285
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,839
Chappelle on a on a sitcom I mean I

1286
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:17,480
guess I can a little bit but I he broke

1287
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,079
such ground with sketch comedy that it's

1288
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,440
like it's okay at least in my head it's

1289
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,680
fine yeah yeah he did like he did I

1290
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,319
think he did Delle literally did six

1291
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,240
years of Pilots that didn't go holy [ __ ]

1292
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,400
and he made a ton of money because uh

1293
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,200
because they pay you to make those

1294
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,880
Pilots mhm yeah you know you go the

1295
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,599
right one Mak six figures for one

1296
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,240
episode you know yeah exactly and then

1297
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,799
and then they they don't pick it up he

1298
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:45,760
was uh at a and I and I guess he quit

1299
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:47,880
eventually he was like I can't do this

1300
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,119
anymore and then he went out went off

1301
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,880
and did his own thing I guess eventually

1302
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:57,240
uh you know or I think Neil Neil Brennon

1303
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,680
was was a big factor in that oh okay

1304
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,280
was his co-producer on uh on Chapelle

1305
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,680
show oh yes that's right I see I keep

1306
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,680
forgetting that and the guy and I think

1307
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,480
the guy who like got Chappelle to like

1308
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,559
show up for work and

1309
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,880
like all the Stu you know because

1310
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:16,839
Chappelle's like sort of famously always

1311
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,920
late and and you know only and I've

1312
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:22,160
heard Neil Brenan say Dave only cared

1313
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,200
when there was an audience in the seats

1314
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,119
like in like the live audience for the

1315
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,680
sketch show so they were he said if

1316
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:29,920
there were people and if there were more

1317
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,319
people he was more on and if there were

1318
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,880
less people or if they were further away

1319
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,200
he didn't care as much and he didn't try

1320
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,359
as hard that's so funny to me he could

1321
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,680
he couldn't act for the cameras he had

1322
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:42,960
act for the audience that's really

1323
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,160
[ __ ] funny um so here's the thing I

1324
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,160
want to make sure that you recommend

1325
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,359
well you don't have to recommend this

1326
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,799
album but if you are going to recommend

1327
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,400
fun house 1998 Dana Gould uh I will say

1328
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:54,400
our friends at standup records are the

1329
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,119
people who released the vinyl version

1330
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,559
and that's what I have right here um

1331
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,760
what's uh what's a good reason to listen

1332
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,920
to this album if you haven't heard it

1333
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,000
before a good reason to listen to this

1334
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:09,280
album is that it is a document of a

1335
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,079
extremely specific time in standup where

1336
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,559
uh much like the alternative music boom

1337
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,920
of the early 90s like when suddenly

1338
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,920
Nirvana's the most popular man in the

1339
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:24,119
world uh the most popular kind of Comedy

1340
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:28,000
for a brief moment became the comedy of

1341
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:30,920
the weirdos with the very specific and

1342
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,680
uh and nerdy references but also it had

1343
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:37,280
an edge to it now uh so they were like

1344
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,880
cool uh they were they were cool and

1345
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,280
interesting and specific now you're

1346
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,799
there's going to be tracks on here that

1347
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,599
you're going to absolutely hate and as

1348
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:48,359
soon as you hear one of those you can

1349
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,400
just skip right ahead don't feel like

1350
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:53,599
you missed anything just skip right

1351
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,440
ahead just take the uh uh just pull the

1352
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,160
needle up and move it to the next uh

1353
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,559
move it to the next Groove you'll be

1354
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:03,079
fine um and uh but but besides those I

1355
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,839
think that there are tracks on here that

1356
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,559
are just as good as anything else ever

1357
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:11,119
and to hear the and to hear the guy

1358
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:13,480
performing his heart out and uh and uh

1359
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,920
and doing these uh voices and stuff but

1360
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,760
he's doing it in a context where it

1361
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,520
doesn't feel like you're trained to to

1362
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,280
think it should be like that it's hacky

1363
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,040
or that it's Michael Winslow or that

1364
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,559
it's uh or that it's like U you know how

1365
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,559
Kevin poock will do Impressions or

1366
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,799
something like that it's not like that

1367
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:30,960
at

1368
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:33,520
all uh I think that there's a there's a

1369
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,319
cool to it and I think that is it is uh

1370
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,880
it is of its time in a way that's that's

1371
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,079
very interesting and I would be really

1372
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,960
interested to see if comedy's going to

1373
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,440
sort of swing back around in this

1374
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:47,359
direction again you know and I uh I I

1375
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,160
hadn't thought of it in in the uh terms

1376
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,839
you've been speaking of it you know just

1377
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,599
the idea just simply doing voices or

1378
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:56,240
doing a sound or like you say being just

1379
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:57,720
being more performative I can't disagree

1380
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,359
with that I think I think I like the

1381
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,440
idea of that happen happening a bit more

1382
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:03,960
I would love to see that is it something

1383
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,280
that you would be comfortable like

1384
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,440
actually like what would it take for you

1385
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,200
to break out of any shell that might be

1386
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,319
there to actually do that thing I think

1387
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,960
actually you know listening to this over

1388
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,480
this past week like over and over again

1389
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,000
uh in preparation for this show has

1390
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,599
really made me think a lot about what

1391
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,720
I'm doing and how I have bits where

1392
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,920
there's I mean I have a specific bit

1393
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,920
where I'm uh which is from my real life

1394
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,440
where I'm laugh by the cops uh and they

1395
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,559
think I robbed a bank but I didn't rob

1396
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,720
the bank and then something really

1397
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:36,119
embarrassing happens um God like I

1398
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,359
didn't I didn't commit the crime but it

1399
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,880
would have been more embarrassing if

1400
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:42,119
they just arrested me for a crime than I

1401
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,240
committed or less embarrassing rather um

1402
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,480
like if I if I had just robbed a bank

1403
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,520
and they arrested me for it they would

1404
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,359
be less embarrassing for what they

1405
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:54,599
discovered uh when they searched me but

1406
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:56,640
um but the uh but I but I have a whole

1407
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:58,440
thing where I'm a bit where I'm talking

1408
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,960
to the police officer and he's like sort

1409
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:05,520
of interrogating me and uh and I would

1410
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,119
like for that bit to be more and it

1411
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:11,119
works fine you know I get my laughs but

1412
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,480
but I would like it to feel more like

1413
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,640
I'm really having a conversation with

1414
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,000
another person and I think I would

1415
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,359
actually like to make that cop a

1416
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,040
character that I'm doing and to make

1417
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:22,119
myself more of a character I think I

1418
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,640
would like to to do more actess and I've

1419
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:26,520
done I've done improv too where you're

1420
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,720
encouraged to do all that stuff stuff

1421
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,039
and that definitely helped me uh be more

1422
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,960
loose on the stage and more

1423
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,720
improvisational which I very much am I

1424
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,280
have my bits and then I go in and out of

1425
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,480
them and talk to the crowd uh I mean I'm

1426
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,920
not Jimmy parto or anything but I but

1427
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,079
that's what I aspire to uh but I but I

1428
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,039
definitely would like to I would like to

1429
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:48,680
act stuff out I would like to try and do

1430
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,880
more stuff I mean I would like if

1431
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,240
there's if something calls for an

1432
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,599
impression I would like to I would like

1433
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,119
to at least give it a shot you know what

1434
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,720
I mean yeah you know what's interesting

1435
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,960
too is I feel like there's this there's

1436
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,440
this self-awareness and

1437
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,720
self-consciousness that comes with doing

1438
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,599
impressions where it changes the timing

1439
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,240
of a bit where if you're just talking

1440
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,400
and saying for instance well then the

1441
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,880
cop said well the cop walks up to me and

1442
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,799
if you're just doing your voice you

1443
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,480
don't have to do any sort of uh physical

1444
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:15,079
separation necessarily but there is this

1445
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,119
temptation when you're doing a character

1446
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:18,640
to give it some breadth so that there's

1447
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,960
just distance between your voice and the

1448
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,400
other voice which you know so it's

1449
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,079
interesting because it would Pro I would

1450
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,680
guess it would it's going to change the

1451
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,240
timing of a bit if you do a voice also

1452
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,760
really want to know what it does to the

1453
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,240
bit and if it gives you extra confidence

1454
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,640
if it changes your perception of your

1455
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,640
own stuff that's

1456
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,680
interesting I think uh I think it's

1457
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,400
going to be an experiment now I also I

1458
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,880
mean I've been teaching standup classes

1459
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,079
for the past uh for the past few months

1460
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,119
as well there's an improv theater that

1461
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,920
asked me to do it uh so I'm acquainted

1462
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:50,079
with them awesome and it's been uh it's

1463
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,680
been really interesting I mean like a

1464
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,640
lot of comics say uh you had you

1465
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,960
actually actually uh I was very inspired

1466
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,319
by your podcast because I was asked to

1467
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,480
do this and I was a little reticent

1468
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:05,440
because so many comedians are patently

1469
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,680
against the idea of standup classes

1470
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,119
course yeah uh and because of well

1471
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,760
there's a lot of bitterness and jealousy

1472
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:14,760
having to do with anything where anybody

1473
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,200
makes any money ever um but the idea

1474
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,680
that you're ripping people off because

1475
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:21,319
you can't teach people to be funny yeah

1476
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,680
as if that's what having a class is

1477
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:26,880
designed to do MH uh the class the idea

1478
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,640
of a standup class is like hey why don't

1479
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,440
you get used to all of the apparatus of

1480
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,920
standup and maybe get in a room where

1481
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,720
you're forced to write some jokes and

1482
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,839
talk to other people and sort of

1483
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,839
Workshop things and you know throw a

1484
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,480
little bit of theory in there whatever

1485
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,720
and then maybe that'll make you better

1486
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,280
prepared to have to go uh into a bar

1487
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,440
with zero people paying attention where

1488
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,280
you have to get up on stage in front of

1489
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,359
strangers for the first time like that's

1490
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,200
the and you had Jimmy Paro on here and

1491
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,920
he talked about that very same thing

1492
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,720
which is also mentioned never not funny

1493
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:02,200
a couple of times and every time I hear

1494
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,160
it it reminds me that I don't have to I

1495
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,680
don't have to listen to other you

1496
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:08,160
shouldn't listen to other Comics anyway

1497
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,160
because they're [ __ ]

1498
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,160
um you know I'm also even the ones I

1499
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:15,440
even the ones I love and my friends you

1500
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,119
know I I and I won't go off on this

1501
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,839
today because I feel like it's an essay

1502
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:23,000
worth of stuff but I'm not a big fan of

1503
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:25,160
uh people believing in in and a lot of

1504
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,920
people that I admire do uh believing in

1505
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,520
being naturally funny I don't believe

1506
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,240
that I also don't believe in talent I

1507
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,880
just don't believe it I'm I'm actually

1508
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,640
in your exact same camp I think that

1509
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,240
that's [ __ ] and I think that that

1510
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,599
well honestly if you start telling

1511
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,480
people you're either funny or you're not

1512
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:43,960
then you're just telling a whole bunch

1513
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,200
of people that they should never even

1514
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,760
try exactly and you're and and we're

1515
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,480
missing out on people who could be some

1516
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,440
of the uh great and amazing performers

1517
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,720
and it's like just like anything it's

1518
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,880
like uh if you said to somebody uh

1519
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,440
you're either a banker or you're

1520
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:03,000
not and if you don't know how to be a

1521
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,359
banker right now then you never

1522
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,960
will good God that's the perfect way to

1523
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:10,200
put it yeah exactly and it's like well

1524
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,920
gez I don't know anything I mean oh I

1525
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,559
don't even know

1526
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,839
I I don't even know what FDIC stands for

1527
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,200
I guess I can't be a banker [ __ ] yeah

1528
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,640
I guess well and there's certainly no

1529
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,640
way to learn yeah that's like well the

1530
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,799
things we use the word talent to to uh

1531
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,799
just brush off any skill we've had and

1532
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:30,160
that's like wait hold on I've tried for

1533
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:32,319
years to do this I think I'm okay at

1534
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,920
this I've I've gotten here because of my

1535
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:36,200
own effort not cuz I was born with this

1536
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,720
like what the hell like it's just anyway

1537
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,799
like I say I could go on for people well

1538
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,920
people talk people say things that are

1539
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,160
the Polar Opposites of each other

1540
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,760
practically in the same breath they say

1541
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,920
they say oh you're either you're funny

1542
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,599
or you're not and then they also say it

1543
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:54,799
takes 10 years to get good at right

1544
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:58,000
right so I mean which is it honestly and

1545
00:59:54,799 --> 01:00:00,280
it's like so the yeah the idea that that

1546
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,160
you can't be taught or that you or that

1547
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,280
you can't be funny like you know people

1548
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,960
learn to do things people learn to sing

1549
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,760
people learn to dance why can't people

1550
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,799
learn to tell jokes it's not it's and

1551
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,880
also the idea that jokes are honestly

1552
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:17,079
it's not as mystical as people think it

1553
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,880
is it's like a joke has a setup and a

1554
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:22,319
punchline and if you can remember that

1555
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,160
um and think about it in those terms

1556
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:28,000
that hey here's some context and then

1557
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,480
here's a thing that you expect and then

1558
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
the thing that you expect doesn't happen

1559
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,440
and instead I've put a little twist in

1560
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,160
here and done something different uh

1561
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,640
that's literally what comedy is yeah

1562
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,760
yeah people people need to calm the [ __ ]

1563
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,119
down and like you say I love the idea

1564
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,640
you know that there are people out there

1565
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,440
who might be uh you know have this

1566
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,599
undiscovered talent and it's okay

1567
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,160
[ __ ] try it's okay to try it's

1568
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,319
[ __ ] okay to try I was it's

1569
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,079
definitely okay to try and and guess

1570
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:54,880
what that's why there's open mics no one

1571
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:56,559
can stop you no if you're out there and

1572
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,720
you're thinking about and I just to say

1573
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,720
if you're out there and you're listening

1574
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,000
to this show because you love comedy and

1575
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,039
you've thought oh I could never do

1576
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,640
standup I can never be funny like those

1577
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,799
people are funny and it's like yeah

1578
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,640
neither could they 10 years ago or 20

1579
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:12,280
years ago uh they had to get up there

1580
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,720
and be in front of people and fail and

1581
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:18,400
fail and fail and fail and fail uh and

1582
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,039
you know and and and it took they just

1583
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,119
had to overcome it and it's the same

1584
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,119
thing with uh you know I heard Chris

1585
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:25,960
Hardwick say once that you should do

1586
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,799
stand up a hundred times before you even

1587
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,839
decided if you're if you should continue

1588
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:32,720
to do standup if you're any good or not

1589
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:35,319
yeah um and so then I did I did stand up

1590
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,079
100 times in my first year holy [ __ ] and

1591
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:39,039
uh well and after you do that you're

1592
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:42,760
like well I'm in it now of course of

1593
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:45,400
course yeah uh so it was a good goal and

1594
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,720
you only have to do it twice a week uh

1595
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,440
and luckily uh where I am in Rochester

1596
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,359
we have a really good comedy scene we

1597
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,279
have a lot of open mics we have a lot of

1598
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,760
opportunities to get up and a lot of

1599
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,720
people putting on small shows that you

1600
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,920
can get on and then we have a club and

1601
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,559
and then there's the whole region we

1602
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,279
have a lot of cities nearby that you can

1603
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:02,920
do stuff around into so it's it's worked

1604
01:02:01,279 --> 01:02:05,079
out really well for me but there's no

1605
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,480
reason why if if you think you can do it

1606
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:09,480
don't let anybody tell you that you're

1607
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,119
not funny go up there and you know prove

1608
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,440
it absolutely absolutely that's perfect

1609
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,079
this this is a good way to end it but

1610
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,559
let's also make sure uh tell people

1611
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,279
where they can find you and your podcast

1612
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:24,279
