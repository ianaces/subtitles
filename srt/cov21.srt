having me thank you for helping me get

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,959
here um so we just generally like to

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,400
start you know why what's so important

60
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,480
about this album to

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,319
you um I think when you sent me the

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,440
invitation to be on your show you said

63
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,040
influential or did I just make that up

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,000
no that's exactly what I said which

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,159
might be a different Choice than

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,200
favorite um

67
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:18,680
sure the order of my influence and

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,239
standup vinyl would be my parents had

69
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,599
all the Bill Cosby stuff so that was my

70
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,640
first stuff I listen to I listen to

71
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,480
every single Bill Cosby

72
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,599
record um and that that dominated my

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,680
youth uhuh

74
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,560
um and they had a Woody Allen record too

75
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,080
that was great that was pretty much it

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,159
in my memory of what my parents had and

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,799
and I didn't really as a kid buy comedy

78
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,319
records I don't know if it occurred to

79
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:51,920
me or not um but then but then it was

80
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,760
Steve Martin like so many standups in my

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,040
generation would probably

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,200
say people my age would probably either

83
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,920
say Richard prior or Steve Martin as

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,720
their

85
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,560
number one influence and Steve Martin

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,879
was probably more the direction I went

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,360
and then Andy kman who didn't

88
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,400
really have a record I don't think but I

89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,919
I his things that I saw on video

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,840
probably influenced me mhm um more than

91
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,960
anything I was kind of Blown Away by

92
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,600
that but that that wasn't until really

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,280
when I was in

94
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,120
college

95
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,560
and but I'd have to say what I when I

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,160
learned about Lenny Bruce which was

97
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,479
College too that that was when I was

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,880
starting to

99
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,560
consider that standup comedy could

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,199
actually be a career like that never

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,840
even occurred to me when I was in high

102
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,960
school I I thought I was going to be an

103
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,560
investment banker like my dad that's why

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,400
I went to college and I in my I don't

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,080
know even how I thought of it I guess I

106
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,120
thought that if you wanted to be a

107
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,919
comedian or even in a band or something

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,479
like that you had to be from New York

109
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,840
City or Los Angeles like a city and I

110
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,800
was from Little Rock Arkansas so it

111
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,520
didn't even occur to me that I could as

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,240
much as I love those things it never

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,440
even occurred to me that I had the right

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,160
to be one of those things which is kind

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,919
of

116
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,680
odd um is that what you studied in

117
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,800
school in col economics for about a half

118
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,240
a semester until I realized how stupid I

119
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,319
was compared to everybody else who was

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,880
in the class I was like well this

121
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,400
obviously is not what I'm good at um I

122
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,199
went to school at ammer College up in

123
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,960
Massachusetts so that was also a whole

124
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,440
different scene than the Arkansas Little

125
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,919
Rock Arkansas I'd grown up in

126
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,840
so my mind was being opened up in all

127
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,000
sorts of ways but um I was an American

128
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,199
Studies

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,120
major and I chose for my thesis Lenny

130
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,639
Bruce awesome um so it gave me a great

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,280
excuse to do nothing but listen to uh

132
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,160
Lenny Bruce

133
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,919
recordings and uh I got just about every

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,520
one of them on vinyl um except for this

135
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,680
one oddly enough which may be my

136
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,680
favorite I have it on cassette but

137
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,560
um all of his stuff

138
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,440
is pretty amazing in the story of Lenny

139
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:23,400
Bruce what he did is pretty

140
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:26,840
amazing um I I picked uh I'm not a nut

141
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,240
which it's not like I'm not even sure if

142
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,520
any of the ones the bits here were any

143
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,759
of the bits that he got arrested for my

144
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,919
guess is

145
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,000
no and and the and this one doesn't

146
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,240
necessarily have my the most of my

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,400
favorite Lenny Bruce bits sure but it

148
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,599
has the

149
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,160
ones where he starts to talk about just

150
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:56,160
The Business of Being a

151
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:59,720
standup and comedy and censorship itself

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,639
and he talks about the process of Comedy

153
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I think at when I was listening to that

154
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:08,160
in college that was fascinating to me I

155
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,879
never heard that even if this guy was

156
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,720
you know four decades before me and so

157
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,639
much of the humor is referential and you

158
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,759
can't understand it but I I could

159
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:24,080
understand that or be fascinated by that

160
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:28,039
and there's one bit in particular the

161
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,879
padium mhm which is probably half of the

162
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,720
recording it's it's like a a it's

163
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,479
probably a 30 minute bit if not a 20

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,000
minute bit um but that is one of his

165
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,720
Classic Bits and that is one of my

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,199
favorites

167
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,780
uh we can we can just talk about that

168
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:49,280
bit I guess that but that bit is

169
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,120
[Applause]

170
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:58,599
about a standup who's doing all

171
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:02,400
the you know sleazy standup joints which

172
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:05,000
in those days squirt strip clubs or the

173
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,360
backs of a of a

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,120
bar Vegas yeah stuff he was doing or at

175
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,759
least definitely where he started MH and

176
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,319
um that standup gets a little tired of

177
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,759
that scene he's like I'm ready to take

178
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,280
it to the next level and he wants to do

179
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,840
the padium in London which is like the

180
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,240
biggest

181
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,520
Showcase Live showcase there is and as

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,400
the as manager says that's not your

183
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
scene man that's that's Beville he's

184
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,719
like no that's the next level so I'm not

185
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,479
going to just repeat his whole his whole

186
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,560
bit basically he goes he goes to London

187
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,240
and he

188
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:48,240
bombs three times and uh then in the the

189
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,080
third time there's two funny things

190
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,200
about it one he has to follow this woman

191
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,959
who does this dedication to all the all

192
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,440
the dead soldiers all uh all the English

193
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,399
soldiers who have died in wars and then

194
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,839
brings him out which is like the worst

195
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
thing that an Entertainer can go through

196
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,360
and he has to follow that and he bombs

197
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,839
again but this time to get himself out

198
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,760
of bombing he starts going [ __ ] the

199
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,760
Irish you know Screw the Irish and that

200
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,560
gets the London crowd loving them going

201
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
yeah screw the Irish so where they were

202
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,040
just giving him nothing all of a sudden

203
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,200
they start going

204
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,760
crazy

205
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,760
and that's before I was a performer that

206
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,800
was interesting story mhm once you

207
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,160
become a performer it's even a more

208
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,360
interesting story I think cuz you you

209
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:44,640
I've gone through that exact exact exact

210
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:48,000
thing I uh when I was doing standup in

211
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,279
Chicago I once had to follow this

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,720
guy um who ended his act he he was a a

213
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,959
black comedian he ended and he was

214
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,040
really funny but um he ended his act by

215
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,440
saying before I go I'd just like to tell

216
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,560
you a story I volunteer with Mally

217
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,120
handicapped kids on the weekend and this

218
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,200
weekend I was over speaking to one of

219
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,560
those kids and he said

220
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,600
edmmond um why is your skin Brown and my

221
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,360
Skin's white and I I told him you know

222
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,640
some people are brown and some people

223
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,279
are white and that's how it is um and

224
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,440
then the little boy said well why can't

225
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,240
I be brown and I said well you know you

226
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,240
were born white and I'm born brown and

227
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,160
that's just the way it is and the little

228
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,920
boy said to me I wish everybody could be

229
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,920
all the colors of the rainbow so we

230
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,720
would all get along good night good

231
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,079
night

232
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,639
everybody and then introduced

233
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,519
me

234
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,240
and and he did that to me a couple of

235
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,880
times and he already he was a funny guy

236
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
but that's just like leaving the next

237
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,279
guy in a hole like getting all

238
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,839
sentimental purpose like to make himself

239
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,440
laugh was it no no no I I'm not going to

240
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,240
give him that much credit he he was

241
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,120
doing it to get people to go oh what a

242
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,200
good guy kind of clap clapping as he

243
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,720
went off you know like oh not only did

244
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,519
we laugh tonight but we all learned a

245
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,240
lesson um which is that that you know

246
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,880
that same false sentimentality and that

247
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,600
that Lenny Bruce brings up and he has to

248
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,079
follow and uh another interesting thing

249
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,760
about that is that bit is kind of a

250
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,560
metaphor for

251
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,320
him in that what people really love

252
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,399
about him was at the end if they could

253
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,760
boil him down to something he was he was

254
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,639
the the word back then was sick sick

255
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,000
comedian and what we we call like a

256
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,399
shock I guess is what the word we use

257
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,440
now but he's he's a sick he's a sick

258
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,920
crazy comedian and and at the end like

259
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,279
really what they just wanted him to do

260
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,000
is say [ __ ] or tits or [ __ ] M

261
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,720
um and that's kind of like yelling screw

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,200
the Irish so in a way that was a

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,480
metaphor for his own career that just at

264
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,399
the end it was just let's go see him

265
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,600
curse and get arrested right right um

266
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,399
instead of

267
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,760
really talk about stuff so how long was

268
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,959
it then for you after standup that

269
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,079
sketch became a thing for you I mean for

270
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,760
those who don't know who are listening

271
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,600
uh Matt obviously you started the UCB

272
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,800
with with three other people right

273
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,160
correct okay so how long after stand up

274
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,160
then did it become

275
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,040
sketch in my own career yeah well I

276
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,320
started doing standup right after I did

277
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,760
it in college a little bit enough to get

278
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,600
the bug and then I went to Denver or the

279
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,800
Boulder area right after college cuz a

280
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,920
friend of mine was there and then I went

281
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,880
to Chicago cuz of the boom there was a

282
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,800
ton of clubs in Chicago and I didn't

283
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,639
even know what improv was I went and saw

284
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,720
this this place at The Improv Olympic I

285
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,399
saw Tim and Chris Farley and Kev dorf a

286
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,320
lot of funny guys go up and do this

287
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,560
thing called a uh an improvised heral

288
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:16,519
and who and that that flew me

289
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:18,480
away um and uh so that that that's the

290
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,360
transition I'm not sure if

291
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,240
I'm answering your question but yeah I

292
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,120
wasn't the plan wasn't to get in sketch

293
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,120
and bringing it back to Lenny Bruce what

294
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,120
people

295
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,199
that only casually know Lenny Bruce's

296
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,160
material or what they've read might

297
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,320
might think that he was always just kind

298
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,279
of talking about society and semantics

299
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,320
but really that's only the latter part

300
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,639
of his career once he started getting

301
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,240
busted before that like this

302
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,079
album um he's just talking about

303
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,360
everything and doing a lot of characters

304
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,399
really like just every one of his bits

305
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,240
he does multiple character voices yeah

306
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,240
and he's not I don't think he's really

307
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,680
people talk about that enough I'm a

308
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,800

337
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,839
he became the comedian that he

338
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,519
became um who just spoke honestly he was

339
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,279
like so many comedians he was an

340
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,880
impressionist like he calls the guy

341
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,680
Frank Dell Frank Dell

342
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,519
impressionist you know he's saying that

343
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,600
kind of disparagingly cuz those guys

344
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,000
would just

345
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,759
go here's Bella Losi ordering Chinese

346
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,040
food or whatever they would just do an

347
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,480
impression and not much comment and

348
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,360
that's what he did too so he was

349
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,440
adapting really good at voices and going

350
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,199
back and forth Just is a whole standup

351
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,319
skill in itself so in a way he is a

352
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:57,079
sketch performer and it was only

353
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:58,279
retrospect I was like you know what I

354
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,560
think that's one of the things I really

355
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,800
liked about him he was kind of pretty

356
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,680
much doing sketches by himself there's a

357
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,040
a bit on this album called the defant

358
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,079
ones um which is really a sketch I mean

359
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,120
that's what it is he does it with the

360
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:20,759
guy Eric Miller this guy in his uh jazz

361
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,480
band and he he did throughout his career

362
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,120
a couple of bits with Eric Miller

363
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,319
there's actually a better bit even

364
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,720
called um is it the one how to make

365
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,240
colored people comfortable how to make

366
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,319
uh uh black color people relax that's

367
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,440
what it is um at your party yeah that

368
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,600
one's that one's one of the classics and

369
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,319
really funny this one's pretty funny too

370
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,160
it's a parody of the the movie The

371
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,279
defiant ones but uh it's just a straight

372
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,120
straight up sketch on a standup album

373
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,639
and I

374
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,079
think especially for this time how many

375
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,600
people did that I I can't I can't think

376
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,399
of another standup album that has a just

377
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,079
a sketch all of a sudden like that from

378
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,319
this time period right I mean the other

379
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,880
people who were doing characters like

380
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,920
somebody like Cosby like you mentioned

381
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,039
early it still wasn't a sketch it was a

382
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,760
long long long story they weren't

383
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,079
defined voices they were sort of right

384
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,679
and you didn't have another person join

385
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,760
ex

386
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,640
um or yeah I mean Jonathan wyers and all

387
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,199
those guys did it by themselves but I

388
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,240
can't remember anyone going and now

389
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:22,120
someone's going to join me and do a bit

390
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,919
so that it seems like if he

391
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,760
had been around 10 years later he would

392
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,200
have just been in a sketch group maybe

393
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,000
right maybe

394
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,080
I I hadn't heard a lot of his character

395
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,679
stuff um until last few years because

396
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,200
when I was in college I was introduced

397
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,039
through women's Studies

398
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,280
classes that we were we were yeah so I

399
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,880
heard the most like the most of scene

400
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,440
that they could get which wasn't really

401
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,919
character-based stuff it was just like

402
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,039
straightforward and that's all I would

403
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,120
listen to was like three or four

404
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,400
Snippets and it wasn't until recently

405
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,880
that I actually started listening to

406
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,120
more of his stuff and I didn't realize

407
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,400
how character-based it is is

408
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,120
wonderful and uh yeah I mean PE it's

409
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,440
interesting cuz some other people we've

410
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
talked to on the show like even the

411
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,520
regulars that we spoken to they're

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
usually they're hesitant to bring up

413
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,360
Lenny Bruce because to them they're like

414
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,159
yeah he's not really a standup and I I I

415
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,080
I would disagree with that I think again

416
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,480
I think people know he's not really a

417
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,679
standup yeah how did they say that I

418
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,240
think they consider him or what how they

419
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,200
really put it maybe not so much not a

420
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
stand up but they just generally genu

421
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,720
generally didn't find find them all that

422
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,760
funny which is

423
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,120
it's I think again they're judging him

424
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,200
based on the later stuff where he was

425
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,919
just sitting there and reading Court

426
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,799
transcripts well there's a couple of

427
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,120
Proms and you have to listen to it with

428
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,919
a historical ear a little bit but

429
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,480
um one there are just a ton of

430
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:52,400
references that would would go by over

431
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,440
anybody's head that isn't like into that

432
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,240
era big time um but to me you get the

433
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,280
gist of what he's talking about even

434
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,520
when he's saying references you you

435
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,679
don't really have to know the reference

436
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,320
to understand the overall bit even like

437
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,480
on this album that the Esther Costello

438
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,640
story that's like a specific movie that

439
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,799
was out that year that he's making fun

440
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,520
of but you still get that the movies he

441
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,799
sets it up he's like it's about a blind

442
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,039
and deaf girl who's blind and deaf this

443
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,080
whole movie is this real sad movie at

444
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,200
the end of the movie she gets uh

445
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,400
brutally raped and all a sudden she's

446
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,080
not for blind anymore and he's like what

447
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,880
kind of moral is

448
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,960
that and he takes and that's funny he

449
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,000
takes like five minutes to say what I

450
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,480
said in in a minute but uh and you might

451
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,960
get lost but uh or he has this other bit

452
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,360
about um calling up to get calling up uh

453
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,320
411 to get a a phone number and it's

454
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,200
just a simple observation that Jerry

455
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,880
Seinfeld probably made you know it's

456
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,280
just like if you call more than once you

457
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,039
feel like changing your voice cuz you

458
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,320
feel like an idiot that's just a simple

459
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,880
comedic pres uh premise but people have

460
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,720
to realize that people didn't really

461
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,200
talk like that and do standup like that

462
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,000
before Lenny so as a standup people

463
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,320
should appreciate that like there's so

464
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,679
many things where where people are like

465
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,200
Ah that's you could even listen to l

466
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,240
Bruce thing and go oh that's hack and

467
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,679
it's like yeah it is hack but he did it

468
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,039
first right right um and people just

469
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,720
don't get it he set up so so much of the

470
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:37,039
basic structure for how standups do

471
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,480
standup so to say he's not standup is

472
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,080
absurd it's a lot more to say I don't I

473
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,640
don't relate to it I can get sure yeah

474
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,400
you got to concentrate it's a little

475
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,840
intimidating sometimes you really have

476
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,240
to be like focused on it mhm I he's got

477
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
a lot more casual approach to the

478
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,640
audience and I don't know again I don't

479
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,039
know what your standup was like but did

480
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,320
did any of that influence you I mean oh

481
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,080
no if you're you're saying that I do

482
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,080
stand up like Lenny Bruce not at all um

483
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,640
but yeah that's what it wasn't an

484
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,200
influence of

485
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:13,559
like I want to get up there man and

486
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,159
really dig it you know I wasn't uh if

487
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,240
anything the first time I went up

488
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,679
everybody thought I was Bob doing Bobcat

489
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,320
go weight cuz I was so nervous I was

490
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,120
stuttering and my hand arms were shaking

491
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,240
and I had this crazy loud nervous

492
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,760
energy um and people thought was funny

493
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,200
and I was and I pretended that it was on

494
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,919
purpose you know all that nervous energy

495
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,799
and that kind of became

496
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,720
my character for a while which is

497
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,320
nothing like lny Bruce at

498
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,880
all but uh to me it was more the

499
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,400
influence

500
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,240
was especially being in college before I

501
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,480
was doing it at that point was holy [ __ ]

502
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,720
like a standup was a historical figure

503
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,840
like he

504
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,520
the way we think about censorship and

505
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,600
art today he was the the Forefront of

506
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,559
that he he was the middle of that and

507
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,559
that was a standup comedian I think

508
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,400
that's so [ __ ] cool yeah um the only

509
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,000
guy we have to compare that to now would

510
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,840
be Howard Stern right is another hero of

511
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,640
mine and I think he's really

512
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,559
cool

513
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,200
um and like to take just a snippet of

514
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,679
Howard Stern you wouldn't listen to it

515
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,679
go that's genius the way you would a a

516
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,240
Woody Allen bit or a Steve Martin bit or

517
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,000
whatever but you have to kind of take

518
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,000
the

519
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,320
overall you know the the overall

520
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,600
uh body of work and what it means and

521
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,799
what Howard has done for censorship and

522
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,919
freedom of speech and being able to

523
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:55,640
speak comedically with

524
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,240
freedom and not be repressed and I think

525
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,960
it went from Lenny Bruce pretty much to

526
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,679
him

527
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,760
you know and there were some guys in the

528
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,559
middle

529
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:09,120
like Richard Pryor Sam Kennison but

530
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,640
uh I think you can almost point to or

531
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,679
Eddie Murphy I can think you can almost

532
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,600
point to some of the stuff they did is

533
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,440
setting

534
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,520
back

535
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,880
uh doing stuff that was offensive and

536
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,880
not intelligent right like when Eddie

537
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,240
Murphy does Ralph you

538
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,480
know you know one of [ __ ] the other

539
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,360
one the ass just we just did that that

540
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,200
record a couple weeks ago yeah it's it's

541
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,440
like as a kid I laughed but like as an

542
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,080
adult look back I'm like that's just

543
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,480
homophobic simple hack [ __ ] yeah um

544
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,440
but that doesn't take away from the

545
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,640
genius of the rest of the album sure um

546
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,039
especially for being however old he

547
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,679
what's that especially for being however

548
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,440
old he was at the time the rest is

549
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,440
pretty damn good right but so people

550
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,880
could say that's offensive and maybe be

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,039
right and then but then you point to

552
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Lenny Bruce and he was able to defend

553
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,720
every bit he did he could talk about you

554
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,520
know gay people in this um make fun of

555
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,679
gay people but do it in a more

556
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,000
intelligent empathetic way sure um it

557
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,760
wasn't judgmental there was nothing

558
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,200
judgmental about what he did unless it

559
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,039
was judgmental against being a bigot it

560
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,400
seemed to be you know just just more

561
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,840
smart like he had this bit

562
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,039
about and he says [ __ ] over and over

563
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,880
in a way no one could do that today

564
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,559
because

565
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,880
you would think there was hatred behind

566
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,159
the words but when he did it you didn't

567
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,159
feel you didn't feel that cuz he was

568
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,080
saying ker [ __ ] the next Senate so you

569
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:42,200
didn't feel like oh he hates mhh you

570
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,240
knew that wasn't going on but his his

571
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,080
bit was something about

572
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,039
uh uh [ __ ] man there's no one braver

573
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,080
in a [ __ ] like uh uh you know these

574
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,600
guys scop to each each other in the

575
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,440
movie theater and just lean over and

576
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,480
start jacking each other out now that's

577
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,840
that's bravery that's courage let's put

578
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,120
those guys

579
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,840
in the Army that's real courage you

580
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,559
don't see any straight guys doing that

581
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,080
they'd get their ass kicked you know and

582
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:11,919
I don't think that's a hateful

583
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,039
no but you know it just it depends where

584
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,960
and that was such a big point of his you

585
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,360
know that's became his thing was saying

586
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,840
it's context it's how you present

587
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,960
it what's behind the word not the word

588
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,640
itself and you know the whole Michael

589
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,720
Richard's thing he would have been

590
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,000
saying hold on Laugh Factory don't say

591
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,760
you can't say the word [ __ ] that's

592
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,880
crazy yeah you you just can't have a

593
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,039
racist on your stage there's a

594
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,799
difference

595
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,320
between don't say the word and don't

596
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,840
allow racist on your stage and he would

597
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,200
have been smart enough to explain that

598
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,880
and do a funny bit but so many

599
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,240
intelligent comedians were just like

600
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,320
don't say the word and we're going to

601
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,559
stop doing it and we're heroes for doing

602
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,279
that it's the words the problem it's

603
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,600
like come on but unfortunately most

604
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,679
Comics say well that's the drunk to do

605
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,480
and they all do that drunk and they

606
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,559
don't see that kind of drunk the drunks

607
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,840
that they don't report are Cafe drunks

608
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,840
that they see time and time again I call

609
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,760
them white collar

610
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,919
drunks now the best part of these

611
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,080
guys it's not when they're in the club

612
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,520
watching a show is when they first come

613
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,559
in because they're really Juiced out of

614
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,799
their nut but they drug that they don't

615
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,880
want to be associated with drunks and

616
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,880
they just walk extra cool when they were

617
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,159
so no one knows they loaded they think

618
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,399
they're impeccably dressed always clean

619
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:41,480
shaven buff Nails whacked out of their

620
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:46,320
skull you think I'm drunk don't you no M

621
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,320
you look perfectly sober godamn right I

622
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,240
am listen right

623
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,120
here hey why don't you stop wiping those

624
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,240
glasses for a minute will you and listen

625
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,240
to me

626
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,760
what do you want some trouble

627
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,320
H want a little trouble glass wiper

628
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,120
huh have they it seems like they've

629
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,480
missed a whole lot I mean were you a fan

630
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,919
of George Carlin I mean after this I

631
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,600
mean I was I was um I mean he he went

632
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,080
out of his way to not be compared to lny

633
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,360
Bruce understandably cuz they're not the

634
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,039
same kind of comics um but I I don't

635
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
know I guess I guess my question is is

636
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,679
it is it okay

637
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,200
if is should there be any conflict

638
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,480
between being a funny person and being

639
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,159
important because a lot of people find a

640
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,640
conflict you know or you know just let

641
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,279
him be a comic he doesn't need to be

642
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,320
saying important things

643
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,880
or I know how I feel say again do do you

644
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,399
have to say important things to be a

645
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,159
comedy no I'm saying do you people try

646
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,880
and make it uh exclusive mutually you

647
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,279
have to either be funny or be saying

648
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,760
something important or something

649
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,039
intelligent um and it seems to me and

650
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,640
again people just I think that's what

651
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,440
puts some people off of somebody like

652
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,960
Lenny Bruce where he is he's being

653
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,559
offensive he's also being brilliantly

654
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,039
funny but he's also saying something

655
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,679
important and some people get turned off

656
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:15,080
by that and I guess my question is why

657
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,919
why do you think that might be that's a

658
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,279
deep question right there it's a little

659
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,000
convoluted actually better way to put it

660
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,880
well first off a lot of people might

661
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,840
know Lenny

662
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,200
Bruce my first intro to him was Lynn

663
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,279
the uh the Dustin Hoffman movie M which

664
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,440
was brilliant and if you watch that you

665
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,799
get the impression that all like I was

666
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,480
saying earlier in this interview all he

667
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:44,919
did was talk about semantics yeah um and

668
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,440
he did a lot of that and some of his

669
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,480
most brilliant bits are that like that

670
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,600
bit to come come come two preposition

671
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,679
come as a verb

672
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,240
um I think those are the bits that

673
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,039
people know and those that's just a

674
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,039
[ __ ]

675
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,440
satirical bit about language and

676
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,200
censorship and freedom of speech it's

677
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,640
just a real headyy bit but that I think

678
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,840
that's what most people know him for and

679
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,440
that's not all his work and then in the

680
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:19,279
end all he

681
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,360
did was uh read his court transcripts

682
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,159
and and just kind of do commentary on

683
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,559
him but um he became really obsessed

684
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,399
with that it seemed toward the end yeah

685
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,399
yeah I mean CU that was his whole life

686
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:33,360
but and I'm pretty sure that's there's

687
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,919
not much if any concert footage of him

688
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,760
besides that so I think

689
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,640
unfortunately that's what he becomes

690
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,039
known for but really that's a small part

691
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:49,000
of of what his body of work was about it

692
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:51,600
wasn't all about that um so and how I

693
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,360
try to think who are other comedians

694
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,360
that are

695
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,080
considered what word are we using here

696
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,679
important or I guess

697
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,640
influential and yeah what other ones

698
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,640
would you say like that

699
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,720
like like I don't think him is

700
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,320
necessarily being like if someone would

701
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,120
go he's a political Comm like no he

702
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,279
wasn't I mean he he did talk about

703
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,799
political stuff and racism but he wasn't

704
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:23,519
Mort Saul who was was his contemporary

705
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,120
that was the he was the political

706
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,120
comedian he makes it crack about him on

707
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,720
this Al some and he makes crack about

708
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,159
Shelley Burman and I've heard I think he

709
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,919
had a a thing with Shelly Burman which I

710
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,480
wish I knew more about cuz he's always

711
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,799
kind of throwing out his name I'm never

712
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,000
really

713
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,960
quite understand what he didn't like

714
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,559
about

715
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,840
him um it seems almost every comedian

716
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:48,799
lists Lenny Bruce as an influence and

717
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,159
then trying to look up stuff I can't

718
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,640
find people who Lenny Bruce ever said

719
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:54,159
influenced him like his direct

720
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,360
influences I was having a tough time but

721
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,799
I didn't read his book did you read his

722
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,000
autobiography I've never read his

723
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,559
autobiography so

724
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,840
um was autobiography is half [ __ ]

725
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,519
for one how to influence people on yeah

726
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,120
um I've talked already influence people

727
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,399
like half of it's made up but um the

728
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,840
Albert Goldman biography is is brilliant

729
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:18,200
it's a great book if you're really

730
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,159
interested but

731
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,200
um yeah I mean who would his since he

732
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:26,840
pretty much changed stand up that there

733
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,120
there was no one like him mhm like a lot

734
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,880
of people say one of his friends who

735
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,399
wasn't a comedian was his biggest

736
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,760
influence I forget the guy's name but

737
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:36,080
and there's a lot of comedians who could

738
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,679
say that like I think there's a lot of

739
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,600
comedians who have that funny friend

740
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,320
they grew up with who was funny and

741
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,240
never became a comedian but was very

742
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,080
influential in their sense of humor and

743
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,960
uh Lenny Bruce definitely had that guy

744
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:53,279
in his life it's a shame I can't

745
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:58,519
remember his name um but other than that

746
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,960
he it was all cheesy kind of jokey

747
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,679
you know hny

748
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,519
Youngman type humor it was uh it was

749
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,880
either jokes or Impressions it wasn't

750
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:11,120
people just speaking honestly about

751
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,720
stuff it must have been freeing to be

752
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,720
able to find something else to talk

753
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,840
about but then at the same time to be

754
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,679
sort of slapped around for talking about

755
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,399
something different besides the old [ __ ]

756
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,159
I I I just can't imagine what that feels

757
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,760
like and I feel like no there aren't any

758
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,559
stand-ups who nowadays who have anything

759
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,159
comparable to deal with there's not much

760
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,399
to deal with is there what do you mean

761
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,320
no outside influence other other than

762
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,840
just your life spouting your life out on

763
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,919
stage maybe finding a character and

764
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,799
doing something but I mean he had you

765
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,639
know politics to deal with he had people

766
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,440
he had the uh you know he had the FBI he

767
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:45,159
had everybody else you know trying to

768
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,720
clap down on him I I don't feel like we

769
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,840
have that well what we do have

770
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,600
interestingly enough is

771
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,639
uh what has happened to Michael Richards

772
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,399
what happened to Tracy

773
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,960
Morgan um

774
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,799
um is

775
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,840
technology is technology going to start

776
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,880
censoring Comedians and then what

777
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,200
happened to Patton Oswalt recently too a

778
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,200
standup ComEd

779
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,159
uh he was doing a set basically

780
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,399
uh not an open mic show but a small show

781
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,279
at a restaurant or something and a

782
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,240
member of the audience started taping

783
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:28,279
him and he was like stop taping me and

784
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,919
then they got into it

785
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,600
um you know and

786
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:36,519
uh you know he went after her like you'd

787
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,120
go after a Heckler sure and then a

788
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:43,559
fellow standup the next day wrote A Blog

789
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,559
you know calling him an [ __ ]

790
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,039
so and I don't want to lump Tracy Morgan

791
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:51,039
and Michael Richards Paton all together

792
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,720
but it's basically it's like now we have

793
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,399
people in the audience with their cell

794
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:00,399
phones who can now take take a piece of

795
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,799
material out of cont text mhm or even

796
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,080
not the material just have their opinion

797
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,960
online on Twitter immediately mhm uh

798
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,240
like it just happen to D Cooks I'm I'm

799
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,879
listening like four or five examples of

800
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,159
cell phones or Twitter or social

801
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:20,280
networking commenting on a standup

802
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,520
immediately and the standup in the worst

803
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,000
case ruining his life with Michael

804
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,240
Richards yeah a little less than that

805
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,720
Tracy Morgan affecting his career career

806
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,440
not ruining it but definitely him being

807
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,200
slapped around having to make apologies

808
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,879
and

809
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,399
[ __ ] Patton in his case not

810
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,359
affecting his career but him having to

811
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,040
deal with [ __ ] online for a week

812
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,839
same with Dan cook so it definitely

813
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,399
affects people it affects the next way

814
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,520
they're going to do material the next

815
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,919
time they're up or maybe it doesn't that

816
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,879
just

817
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,919
depends how they're going to deal with

818
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,960
this new type of censorship but it is

819
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,000
kind of a it's not from the government

820
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,280
it's from our own fans yeah it's kind of

821
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,079
weird or our fellow

822
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,480
comedians for you I mean have you ever

823
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,720
experienced anything like that I mean I

824
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,839
know you don't I mean do you still do

825
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,760
standup or are you still exclusively I

826
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,800
know you do shows I do know you

827
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,320
do um uh yeah I do I don't know if you

828
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,880
call it stand up I do solo I go up solo

829
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,760
and do characters or do what I would

830
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,920
call bits mhm

831
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,839
um have have I I've been affected by

832
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,240
this what I'm calling technological

833
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:38,760
censorship I I don't think so I mean

834
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,920
I've done stuff before

835
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,480
where I I've I'm always going after the

836
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,400
pope and the CH molestation stuff in the

837
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,079
Catholic church I just think it's crazy

838
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,640
and I think it's crazy how people don't

839
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,280
talk about it I think it's crazy

840
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,160
how cath people call themselves

841
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Catholics don't do more about it so I'm

842
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,920
always making fun of that

843
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,720
and I was doing a bit one I think I was

844
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:07,000
the I was being the the Nazi Pope and

845
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,839
doing a bit about it in in the bit

846
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,680
talking about how um Hispanic Catholics

847
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,280
in particular are crazy on the down low

848
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,560
and no one will admit to being gay in

849
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:23,280
that culture which is dead on fact and

850
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,920
this Hispanic Catholic in the crowd uh

851
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,839
uh threw a chair at me on stage really

852
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,720
what yeah

853
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:35,319
so it definitely riled him up enough to

854
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,400
get violent and then I didn't break

855
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,160
character but we we we I I taunted him a

856
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,760
lot about that religion is definitely

857
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,400
something that people kind of go off and

858
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,079
I think that's one of the reasons that

859
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,960
people singled any Bruce out so much for

860
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,720
the obscenity stuff was the

861
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,599
religious yeah they say in when he got

862
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,280
busted in Chicago that is what it was

863
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:00,000
about um they might have pointed to the

864
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,079
the obscenities the reason but they say

865
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,880
him going after the Catholic church in a

866
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,839
town like Chicago was the his biggest

867
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,280
mistake yeah and that's what the cops

868
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,800
were saying when they were busting him

869
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,359
he even does that bit though on there

870
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,640
about how it's going to offend the Jews

871
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,160
so you know we think it's probably going

872
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,440
to offend we think it'll offend the

873
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,960
Gentiles too yeah he does this bit about

874
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,960
going on the Steve Allen Show which is

875
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,119
another behind the scenes stand up and

876
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,640
talking about censorship which is

877
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,079
fascinating me about going on the show

878
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,760
and it sounds like a a

879
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,119
story that Bill Hicks would have told

880
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,480
about Letterman or Louis SE could tell

881
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:40,000
about going on Letterman or Conan today

882
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,560
about how they they go through your bit

883
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,359
you know the guys on the shows they

884
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,040
still do that and they examine every bit

885
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,800
for who it could possibly offend and

886
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,800
it's not just words it it can like this

887
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,800
particular bit was about he couldn't you

888
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,160
can't get buried in a Jewish cemetery if

889
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,839
you have a tattoo Steve Allen's got a

890
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,359
very hip sense of humor and he cracks up

891
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,280
everything I'm doing producer bill

892
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,440
harbach is hip but he's got a little

893
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,720
more to lose so he gives these kind of

894
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,720
laughs

895
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,000
like now I went into a bit they didn't

896
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,240
let me do on the island show I have a

897
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
tattoo it's really it's not a cocka M or

898
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,880
anything doesn't rub off because of this

899
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,560
tattoo I never couldn't be buried in a

900
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,040
Jewish cemetery that's the Orthodox

901
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,319
scene have to go out of the world the

902
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,400
way you came in no mark no changes which

903
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:33,880
certainly disab the rabbi philosophy I

904
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,880
don't know where that

905
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,119
swings I got back from Malala so I'm

906
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,960
over my aunt's house in Jamaica Long

907
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,359
Island I'm in a kitchen I'm washing with

908
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,920
a Roki

909
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,359
soap she pins the tattoo so she looks

910
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,359
and she

911
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,079
flips it's your real Jewish seago you

912
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,839
say look at you did you're ruin your arm

913
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,960
you can't be better than that je

914
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:09,560
Cemetery what do you cut the they B this

915
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,920
in a gentile Cemetery like you all right

916
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,760
okay

917
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:18,800
now the guy says to me you can't do that

918
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,760
joke why not um so his suggestion was

919
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,240
well I only have a tattoo on my arm so

920
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,880
bury uh all my body in the Jewish

921
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,079
cemetery except for my arm bury that in

922
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,480
a Christian Cemetery and they're like

923
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,400
well that's offensive to the Jews and

924
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,280
he's like no it's not and then they took

925
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,640
a day to think about it and they came

926
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,319
back they're like you know Lenny we

927
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,400
thought about it and uh it's definitely

928
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:42,240
offensive to the Christians too because

929
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,920
that implies Christians will be bury

930
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,200
anything in their

931
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,680
cemeter so there's no cursing there it's

932
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,079
based upon a fact that Jews have that

933
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,920
silly thing in their religion about

934
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:56,000
tatos MH and he certainly wasn't making

935
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,440
fun of Christians that's a that's just

936
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,680
looking to be offended kind thing so it

937
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,119
points

938
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:07,599
out the absurdity of censorship yeah and

939
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,520
uh and it's crazy how I bet you could

940
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,520
still you could do that joke without

941
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,119
problem right now on TV but I but I bet

942
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,520
they look over it a few times still yeah

943
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,640
and think about it well there's a couple

944
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,520
people like Tim mention currently who's

945
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,200
really

946
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,800
pushing his atheistic comedy everything

947
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,319
is about religion with him and it's all

948
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,839
about atheism and he can't get any

949
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,200
anything on American TV for the most

950
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:33,960
part he's been on a ton of podcasts he's

951
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,880
been he's got specials but he can't get

952
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,480
on anything

953
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,480
interesting I guess it scares people but

954
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,440
I yeah at the end of the day the bottom

955
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,079
line is what's what's in the way of of

956
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,119
of speaking your piece a little bit I

957
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:49,440
mean

958
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:52,839
does I don't know uh I had another

959
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,560
question they they seem so fluid Lenny

960
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:57,839
Bruce's stuff to come back to this every

961
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,520
bit seems so fluid was it all written or

962
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,319
was there a level of improv impro

963
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,200
another wasn't not much I I don't know

964
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:05,440
if he says it on this one or another one

965
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,520
I was listening to but he even speaks to

966
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,160
that he was actually it wasn't this one

967
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,119
it's another one he's talking

968
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,560
about um these these bits

969
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,200
really uh written out people think I'm

970
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:22,560
ad libing but I adli at most like 10 to

971
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:26,040
15 words per bit that's right so uh no

972
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,240
he he these were well thought out bits

973
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,000
um if you hear him do them on different

974
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,520
versions are like yeah that's pretty

975
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,079
much the same way another interesting

976
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,000
thing about

977
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,400
the padium bit which I didn't find out

978
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,680
until I was

979
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:46,160
improvising Dell close was a

980
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,960
contemporary of Lenny Bruce and he is

981
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,280
the mentor of the Upright Citizens

982
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,400
Brigade he's one of the original Second

983
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:58,760
City committee guys who invented the way

984
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:02,119
we do improv today and

985
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,680
he told us a story of when Lenny Bruce

986
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,119
was working this bit up was first

987
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,800
working on this bit the plaum about the

988
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,640
standup who goes to the Big Show in

989
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,079
London uh dell was in the audience with

990
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,599
his friend

991
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,920
Frank and that's how the character name

992
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,280
came Lenny Bruce is out there and he

993
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,640
sees both of them together so when it

994
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,960
comes time in the bit to name the

995
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,000
comedian he goes Frank

996
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,599
Dell and that became the

997
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,640
the bit so that that's such a kism weird

998
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,400
thing for me that in

999
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,680
college I would love this particular bit

1000
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,960
so much and then eventually the guy who

1001
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,800
the guy's named after becomes my mentor

1002
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,079
it's very small world weirdness there

1003
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,000
you're going to have to put a cover of

1004
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,599
this a photo of this up on oh I know it

1005
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,960
has to go this just an amazing cover

1006
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:56,680
insane it is I want to buy that from you

1007
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,839
do you think they have that cover do

1008
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,400
they have that other album they have

1009
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,640
another one of those they might you can

1010
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,559
have this one you kiding me oh no no no

1011
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,960
not at all they've got a good selection

1012
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,400
of stuff at the um Counterpoint right

1013
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:14,680
next to the theater there his first

1014
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,680
album which I have is

1015
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,359
uh the sick humor of Lenny Bruce I've

1016
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,680
never heard that one and they have a

1017
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,920
bunch of those in the store and I wanted

1018
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,319
to buy this one it's and it's uh it

1019
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,319
shows him in a eating a a picnic layout

1020
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,440
on

1021
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:37,040
a uh grave in a graveyard and that was

1022
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,440
just considered crazy back then yeah I

1023
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,040
mean it's even pretty sick now

1024
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,920
but then that can I see that was

1025
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,720
considered just outlandish what year is

1026
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:51,319
that album I'm going to guess

1027
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:54,079
1957 or 56 of course it doesn't so it's

1028
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:55,760
definitely old wow um I you know I was

1029
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,440
actually thinking about this listening

1030
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,280
through through this and then again

1031
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,640
realizing how how much he depended on

1032
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,000
voices listening to your stuff in

1033
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,000
podcasts and seeing you online and and

1034
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,960
your sketches as far as your voices a

1035
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,800
lot of them do you've got some similar

1036
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,040
intonation sometimes when you do voices

1037
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,240
I mean does that come out intentionally

1038
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,920
or is there definitely not I think

1039
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,640
that's the Jewish Gene if

1040
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,640
anything cuz there's an English voice on

1041
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,800
here that he does is very similar to one

1042
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,599
you were doing on on I can't remember

1043
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,680
what probably Comedy Bang Bang the other

1044
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,839
day but yeah like almost spot on and

1045
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,040
that's true what what's really

1046
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:34,880
impressive and I I wish I've challenged

1047
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,960
myself to do and I really Haven it is

1048
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,000
how he goes back and forth so quickly

1049
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,359
between the voices MH um that's just a

1050
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
that's a difficult skill it and he he

1051
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:47,760
utilizes the different intonation

1052
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,559
microphone too like he would pull it

1053
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,520
away you hear it louder he does that a

1054
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,800
lot so you really have to I I really say

1055
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,920
to say it I have to focus I was trying

1056
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,720
to listen to this uh last weekend on the

1057
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,559
treadmill and I'm running and there's

1058
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,040
like TVs around me and stuff and I'm

1059
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,160
like I couldn't I couldn't like no and

1060
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,720
he does a lot of bits where he kind of

1061
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,040
just have half sentences where he just

1062
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,800
kind of ends and you just kind of have

1063
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,000
to be in the

1064
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,160
flow you know where he's going you just

1065
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,839
have to know it's like you fill in the

1066
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,200
blank like you know what the guy's

1067
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,800
thinking I think that's that's that's a

1068
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,839
lot of the charm of it I loved listening

1069
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,119
to I cannot remember the album that I

1070
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:28,920
first heard it would it had some bits to

1071
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,880
this so it might have been a compilation

1072
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,640
actually now that I think about it yeah

1073
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,839
the the I almost chose the one that's

1074
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,079
called the what's it called the bits

1075
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,079
that got me arrested or whatever that

1076
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,240
that

1077
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,200
has if you're going to get one Lenny

1078
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,480
Bruce you probably get that one cuz it

1079
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,319
is all the the famous bits um Carnegie

1080
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Hall is also just fascinating cuz it was

1081
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:54,720
such a big night for him

1082
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:58,520
yeah um and and there is stuff that's a

1083
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,520
little more EX extemporary in there I

1084
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,400
love the writing on this one says if you

1085
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,160
value your license and reputation do not

1086
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,160
Air This Record obscene not fair but I

1087
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,559
know that's from well that's from my

1088
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,800
that's my from my radio station I stole

1089
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,960
these records from but yeah those are

1090
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,839
warnings from it's like we have this

1091
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,480
record but you can't play

1092
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:23,920
it and that's you know the

1093
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,359
1990 and I try not to harp on this too

1094
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,559
much cuz people get I think get annoyed

1095
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,680
with it but the physicality of having a

1096
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,880
record I mean did you did you every time

1097
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,200
we talk to somebody usually they've got

1098
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,760
a moment where they just sat down with

1099
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,599
the headphones and and and a record

1100
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,880
player and just listened and just had an

1101
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,319
experience with them themselves in the

1102
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,440
record I mean is that part of maybe not

1103
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:43,440
this album but I mean can you relate to

1104
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,640
that that's

1105
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,960
interesting um when I say a moment with

1106
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,319
yourself it sounded a little creepier

1107
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,319
than

1108
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:57,960
actually it's funny by the time that

1109
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:01,079
I was fantasizing about being a comedian

1110
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,400
myself I was in college M and that's

1111
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,800
exactly when

1112
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,839
CDs was starting to to take

1113
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,200
off

1114
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,960
um so in the way I think you're saying

1115
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,520
like I sat down and would look at a

1116
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,119
Woody on thing and go one day one day or

1117
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,599
something like that like I don't know if

1118
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,400
I had that moment like to me I like

1119
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:25,440
these these uh cassettes you see here I

1120
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,839
got these on the streets of Boston and

1121
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,440
to me there was something more

1122
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:35,079
more what's the word uh Contraband or

1123
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,240
something cool about the like Lenny

1124
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,079
Bruce cassette that I can't find in

1125
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,280
vinyl that I could only find in a

1126
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:43,319
cassette on the street in a

1127
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,880
city

1128
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:50,760
so or in St Mark's Place and you know in

1129
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,240
New York City or something like that so

1130
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,599
uh that might have had more of a punk

1131
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:58,079
rock feel versus my record

1132
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:01,160
collection like I said it was all it's

1133
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,920
it's I still have every comedy record

1134
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:08,839
that I've ever bought but it's it would

1135
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:12,040
be all my parents Bill Cosby's and then

1136
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:14,119
once I got to college I was getting

1137
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,599
funny ones like I got this one here

1138
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:19,559

God amazing and I got another one called

folks and that one's just family comedy

1147
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:44,280
it's about this is comedy anyone in the

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,119

1153
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,680
one I have one I bought we haven't done

1154
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,599
that one yet doesn't have a name great

1155
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,040
it's really good does it have recipes on

1156
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,760
the back re on the yes is great it is a

1157
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,599
lost art form again I won't harp on it

1158
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,040
but you know you get to play with it a

1159
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,760
little bit more there's you got you know

1160
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,920
I gu I I guess CDs you can have more

1161
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,640
liner notes and all that all M were now

1162
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,400
I mean even CDs are disappearing people

1163
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:25,440
are which I think it's a shame I mean

1164
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,000
this this thing of just doing stuff

1165
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,119
digitally I I think it just just stuff

1166
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,640
just disappears to The Ether I I feel

1167
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:37,520
like songs that I buy on iTunes like

1168
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,839
they just disappear the next time I get

1169
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,240
a computer or something like I'm it's

1170
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,160
like oh stick your stick in the clouds

1171
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,359
like it's not the same to me no I do

1172
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,240
want to hold it in my hand on some level

1173
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:52,160
yeah I feel like people are losing

1174
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:54,559
something especially with comedy because

1175
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,000
you don't feel like you own it you don't

1176
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,119
have again you don't have a thing latch

1177
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,839
on to if you can't go see it you need to

1178
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,000
have it at least for me I needed to have

1179
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:06,119
it in person in my hand that was why I

1180
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,799
love to listen to George Carlin and you

1181
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:12,319
know have something physical now if I

1182
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:12,319
can only straighten out govern a

1183
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,200
long doesn't want to listen to me I

1184
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,359
would have had him over but he won't

1185
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,000
dress you know just sits in his pajamas

1186
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:25,200
won't put his teeth in or anything is

1187
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,040
sitting cursing at his wife running

1188
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,799
around taking species of motels like

1189
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,280
he's really a delight though he really

1190
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:37,720
cracked me he had the greatest political

1191
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,240
campaign of any public figure I sh him

1192
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,839
on television dig his political platform

1193
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,440
I'm not a

1194
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:50,839
nut what is that right no honesty better

1195
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,960
schools I'm not a nut that's all I got

1196
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:54,760
so I don't wet the bed elect me that's

1197
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,359
all

1198
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,319
forget Governor long is really a sign of

1199
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:03,000
our times how did the governor get out

1200
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:06,559
he fired the people who put him

1201
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,400
in go fight that kind of

1202
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,680
action you're a nut you're

1203
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,960
fire I only had records growing up

1204
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,240
because my parents were had a huge

1205
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,240
record collection so I all the Cosby

1206
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,480
stuff and the stuff that I wasn't

1207
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,839
allowed to listen to was locked in a

1208
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,240
liquor cabinet which was the the um uh

1209
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:27,200
Richard prior at was of course we

1210
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,280
because of the dirty words

1211
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,839
just in the same way we got into the

1212
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,839
liquor cabinet for the liquor we also

1213
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,119
got into the liquor cabinet for the for

1214
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,400
the records too but I bought records

1215
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,280
when I was in college because they were

1216
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,440
a lot cheaper at the local store I could

1217
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,119
buy a record for a dollar and I got to

1218
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,559
buy a CD for 20 at the time it was

1219
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:46,160
before the price would even come down

1220
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:49,799
cuz CDs were just yeah ridiculous that

1221
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,599
is um uh I don't know do you do you see

1222
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:53,079
any possibility for Resurgence in this

1223
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,599
kind of thing for exactly the reason

1224
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:56,160
we're talking about where people might

1225
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,280
possibly want I mean I know some people

1226
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,960
do Li

1227
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,119
releases on vinyl and all that stuff I

1228
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,599
went to a recording the other night that

1229
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,400
they're only going to release on vinyl

1230
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:07,400
Jah right yeah that was there the other

1231
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:10,079
night so and he's doing it almost like

1232
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,319
it's like that's what's partly funny

1233
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,520
about it is it's released on vinyl

1234
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:17,079
there's there's definitely part of it

1235
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,280
I'll tell you I got you guys made me

1236
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:22,119
bring this this Technics back out from

1237
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,920
the garage I mean that's where it's been

1238
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:26,960
for the last four years Danielle was

1239
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,400
like why are you bringing that out my

1240
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,960
wife and I'm

1241
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,359
like um cuz I want to list my records

1242
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,920
she's like but you never list to your

1243
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:37,960
records I'm like I know because it's

1244
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,640
it's in the garage awesome um so it got

1245
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,880
me to listen to some stuff I hadn't

1246
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,240
listened to in a while um and there's a

1247
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,079
couple of bands that only released on

1248
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,119
vinyl and they've given me records which

1249
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,599
have just sat in my closet for the last

1250
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:55,319
two years and now I finally can listen

1251
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,280
to their music so you guys definitely

1252
00:52:55,319 --> 00:53:00,720
brought me back to the Vine

1253
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,720
pretty funny the problem with in my life

1254
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,960
and it's a silly thing to say but there

1255
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,760
aren't a lot of flat surfaces on my in

1256
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,480
my house to put a uh heavy Technics

1257
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,720
record player down

1258
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,920
on um it's definitely a commitment to of

1259
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,799
space you have to make it is in v in the

1260
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,240
storage of the vinyl is too I think

1261
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:24,240
probably everybody has a water damage or

1262
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,040
sunlight story if they're vinyl

1263
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,240
collectors yeah

1264
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,319
um but yeah it's a shame there's certain

1265
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:37,359
guys in music like Steve Albini who

1266
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:40,440
uh very adamant about keeping vinyl

1267
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,319
around just because um a belief that

1268
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:48,040
it's better sound quality even right um

1269
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:49,799
once you get past the snaps and

1270
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,680
Pops well I mean some of these are

1271
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:53,040
beautiful sounding some of the the I I

1272
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,200
found a few I think this one was in

1273
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,720
pretty good shape even though I heard a

1274
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,440
skip on it last night I was listening to

1275
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:01,240
the MP3 skipping like crazy but um yeah

1276
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,400
no I love that it's important to me just

1277
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,280
as in comedy although Again comedy

1278
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,079
albums are cheaper I just love the

1279
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,240
physical whether it's CD or record I

1280
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:11,240
love having the physical in my hand like

1281
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,359
I I still Ru the day that I went and

1282
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,240
took my CDs out of their Jewel cases and

1283
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,680
put them in books so now I've got six

1284
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,280
books and I hate that now when I buy a

1285
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,200
new CD I've got to shift the entire

1286
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,799
album over and then so I can throw

1287
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,000
another a in there you have to

1288
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:26,599
alphabetize I do that's a mental problem

1289
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,359
beond but I I need the physical thing

1290
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:29,880
and I'll throw it on my computer now I

1291
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:32,079
have it but when my computer dies guess

1292
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,480
what I still have the album I don't I

1293
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,200
don't have to put it in the cloud or pay

1294
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:39,119
money or whatever sound like old men I

1295
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,559
just love it I love the physical copy um

1296
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,079
I don't want to keep you much longer but

1297
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,960
as as as far as uh you know if you were

1298
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,319
to leave people cuz you know one of the

1299
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,040
reasons we do this is so that people

1300
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,000
listen to stuff they've never heard of

1301
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,319
or they never would have thought to

1302
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,520
listen to why would you say listen to

1303
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:53,520
this

1304
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,599
album um

1305
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,440
I I guess if if it's about if it's if if

1306
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,160
it's to to learn about Lenny Bruce it

1307
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:11,920
might not be the Sal it might be the one

1308
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:15,200
that uh is called um what I was arrested

1309
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,079
for uhhuh um cuz that has all the famous

1310
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,760
bits and probably even more of his

1311
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:23,640
Classic Bits but so I might I'm I'm

1312
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,960
working my way out of your question I'm

1313
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:29,680
not sure I would cuz you guys asked me

1314
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,799
what was my most influential so I would

1315
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,039
I guess I would recommend it maybe to

1316
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:36,760
someone who's fascinated by the history

1317
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,039
of Comedy yeah and that's why I think

1318
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,039
this

1319
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:44,280
is it's something he talks a lot about

1320
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:46,839
that bit the plaum I just think is a

1321
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,640
classic bit yeah that needs to be

1322
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:53,480
listened to and then I think these other

1323
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:55,400
bits are just just really show off his

1324
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,480
his character work like he does that one

1325
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,119
the white color

1326
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,880
drunks which is just a very

1327
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,640
simple like he wouldn't have been

1328
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,720
arrested for that right and uh but you

1329
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:11,839
know what he could do that on TV today

1330
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,599
yeah it's just all about it's just a

1331
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:17,119
very simple observation that when people

1332
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:21,000
mostly do drunks they do the

1333
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:24,480
typical uh back alley fall

1334
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,200
down red nose drunk yeah and he does the

1335
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,680
white color

1336
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,599
wine drunk it's just a different kind of

1337
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,680
specific drunk and you want to relate to

1338
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:37,119
that you know what what is it 50 years

1339
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,880
later you could you could do that on TV

1340
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,960
tonight just do it really well like he

1341
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,760
does it or you could do it lame and not

1342
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:48,599
be that good

1343
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:51,520
so so as a as a as a as a sketch guy

1344
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,640
who's not really a standup I think this

1345
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,640
is a cool stand to look at that most

1346
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,839
people wouldn't think you would think

1347
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,280
you think John winners when you

1348
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,359
think stand up and sketch you don't

1349
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,400
think Lenny

1350
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,680
brce that's a really good point or you

1351
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,039
think Robin Williams or Billy Crystal or

1352
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,599
those guys are Dana Carvey you know but

1353
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:14,440
Lenny Bruce you

1354
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,400
think straight ahead talker talking

1355
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,319
about politics

1356
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,559
and which really isn't entirely what he

1357
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,319
was at all maybe most famously what he

1358
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,680
was but not entirely what he was so he

1359
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:31,240
he he did so much for standup just in

1360
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,039
general I think art in general like

1361
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,599
across the board he's done so much for

1362
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:38,119
it without his obscenity trial and what

1363
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,920
he did then yeah like you said earlier

1364
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:41,880
where would we be with a lot of this

1365
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,799
stuff yeah it's good to have that to to

1366
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,359
look back on if somebody tries to shut

1367
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:47,079
you down not that I've had that happen

1368
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,520
but you know if if I were lucky enough

1369
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:50,160
to have somebody try and shut me down it

1370
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,079
would be good to have this as a backup

1371
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,960
up I think and it's not only just when

1372
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:58,119
you mean shut you down you mean like you

1373
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,119
can't say that yeah

1374
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,880
um it also should be uh something to

1375
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,160
think about what you maybe shouldn't say

1376
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,280
or like just be smarter about what you

1377
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,880
do say when you

1378
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:17,480
do like to

1379
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:20,760
me our this era of comedy's [ __ ] is uh

1380
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:23,240
gay people um and I don't think there's

1381
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,640
a lot of people saying the word [ __ ]

1382
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:29,000
necessarily there is there is some

1383
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,079
but I I don't think there's I think more

1384
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,640
of the problem is jokes the punchline is

1385
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,799
just and he was gay yeah and he sucked a

1386
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,319
[ __ ] and that's just the whole punchline

1387
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:43,079
and that's just that's homophobic and

1388
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,079
hateful and

1389
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:48,000
people we should be offended by that

1390
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:52,000
people should think of the semantics of

1391
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,559
how you use the word gay right um and

1392
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,200
that's the type of stuff that lyy Bruce

1393
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:57,599
talked about too it wasn't just we

1394
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,079
should be free to say anything you got

1395
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,520
to see the other side of the coin too

1396
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,640
it's like in a good context because I

1397
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:07,880
think oh this is actually pretty

1398
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,480
interesting the obscenity

1399
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,880
law comes down

1400
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:17,960
to

1401
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:21,680
um there's like four points um one is it

1402
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:24,960
cons is it trying to create lustful

1403
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,680
intent in the audience right so that's

1404
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,640
one thing

1405
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:32,000
um the other one is it offensive by the

1406
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,680
community

1407
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,760
standard um which as he pointed out in

1408
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,559
the area of San Francisco where he got

1409
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,520
busted there were strip bars on every

1410
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:46,880
side of them so that Community can he

1411
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,640
say that his words were creating more

1412
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,520
lust than the

1413
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:57,599
actual tits and ass around him of course

1414
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:59,079
not um wait what what got me into this

1415
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,559
or we just talking about the comun of

1416
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:03,240
this the four points of the observ no

1417
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:06,839
right before

1418
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:11,640
that shutting down yes yeah using words

1419
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:16,680
respons oh the judge said he he said uh

1420
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:20,359
if the words have to offensive words

1421
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:23,319
have to prove that has at least

1422
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:26,599
some redeemable

1423
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:29,160
intent and and and the judge rulle that

1424
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:31,440
his did and l Bruce is like I don't want

1425
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,240
that to be what gets me off I think the

1426
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,760
whole thing is redeemable so you're

1427
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:39,960
basically saying it's all [ __ ] except

1428
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:42,119
for a little piece and he's like [ __ ]

1429
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,480
that that gives everybody a right just

1430
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,480
to come out and be dumb asses and

1431
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,160
pretend to be smart for it and then it's

1432
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,920
okay he's like I don't want to represent

1433
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,760
that everything I'm saying is smart yeah

1434
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:57,000
so don't act like I'm just coming up

1435
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:59,839
here going [ __ ] [ __ ] tit ass mhm and and

1436
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,119
what's funny is when he was being when

1437
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:03,960
they would read back why he was in the

1438
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:06,359
court they would have the cops come up

1439
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,680
there and read testimony they're like

1440
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:10,920
these uh this is the words this is what

1441
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:15,000
his act was but they would just read the

1442
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:18,880
curse words so this there go uh tits

1443
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:22,000
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] tits tits ass

1444
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,960
[ __ ] [ __ ] and it's like Lenny's

1445
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,319
like wait a minute this is this is how

1446
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,440
you're going to judge my ACT can I do my

1447
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:31,000
act and he he made the judge make him do

1448
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,039
allow him to do the act in court it's

1449
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,760
like you're completely taking these

1450
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,640
words out of context and if this is a

1451
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,480
just like people do to Howard Stern like

1452
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:43,039
people who don't know Howard Stern think

1453
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:45,240
he's just the judging

1454
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:48,000
strippers part of the show they've seen

1455
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:50,440
on the E network they don't know he's

1456
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,559
speaking very satirically

1457
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:55,440
about life Society politics every day

1458
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:58,440
you just don't hear that that part of

1459
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,559
the show so you just they just judge it

1460
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,520
by the one part it's like no man he's

1461
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,559
it's it's all good that's the hard part

1462
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,839
there's no filter for intelligent people

1463
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,960
intelligent people have to listen to the

1464
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:09,559
whole thing all the way through and

1465
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,559
intelligent people would want to listen

1466
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,839
to the but that's everything becomes a

1467
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:15,880
filter in order to condense it and make

1468
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:18,359
it interesting to people yeah and that's

1469
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,760
frightening and sad but exactly what

1470
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,119
you're talking about you don't want he

1471
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,799
doesn't want to stand for people just

1472
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,240
saying whatever the hell they want just

1473
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:26,880
because they can but it happens you know

1474
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,240
not to make this too political but it

1475
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,240
happens way too frequently I I think in

1476
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:35,440
