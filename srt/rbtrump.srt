00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,720
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,799
oh let's talk about

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,799
it let's talk about

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,400
it after it happened I had some friends

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,280
try to cheer me up they were like put

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,680
things in perspective Robert I mean yeah

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,359
Trump won but we've had presidents that

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,920
have owned people

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,400
before

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,160
okay true but I feel like we should set

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,160
a higher bar

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,079
than

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,680
slavery especially since no one's

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,800
allowed to do that

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,480
anymore right like you might have an

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
argument if slavery were still legal

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,600
then you could say well look at Trump

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,480
more money than God hasn't bought a

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,079
single fella I respect that you know he

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,960
could he chooses not to that's why he's

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,719
my candidate

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,680
no also say things like well Robert

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,920
Donald Trump winning proves anyone could

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,199
become president no it doesn't he was a

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,239
billionaire it's not like before running

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,799
Trump was assistant managing a Staples

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,360
and was like try to stop me and then

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,159
just beat

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,439
everybody with wits and open-mindedness

30
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,280
and tolerance and weal AO policies no

31
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,520
it's not inspiring that a billionaire

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,640
became president the only people

33
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,479
inspired by Trump are the uncles that

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,479
could shush to

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,079
Thanksgiving you know I'm not the only

36
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,439
one at work that doesn't trust Puerto

37
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,400
Ricans

38
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,840
sh I will not shush I killed that turkey

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,720
myself damn it you're going to hear what

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,399
I have to say about those Ricky Martin

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,399
what what did you call them sh

42
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,119
shush I don't know if you guys caught

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,600
this but apparently Trump has promised

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,560
to repeal Obamacare and replace it with

45
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,360
Trump care which is just a series of

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,600
unsolicited papsmear

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,520
and yeah don't even have to ask for it

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,280
it'll just happen you just have to wait

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,560
for

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,840
it won't cost you anything no co-pay all

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,840
lady

52
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,360
covered you see where he talked about

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,959
how bangable his own daughter was in

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
those interviews too a bangable his own

55
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,640
I mean it worked he won the southern

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,080
states you got to give that to him he

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,239
definitely knew what it took to get

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,560
elected I heard some people tell me that

59
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,480
Trump's victory was a backlash against

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
PC culture I don't know if that's true

61
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,680
or not I think in some cases it it might

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,920
be a little extreme though for instance

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,920
I don't know if you guys know this but

64
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,599
in schools now kids aren't even allowed

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,560
to celebrate Halloween anymore because

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,920
that's offensive Halloween is too

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,280
offensive so they can't call it

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
Halloween anymore they have to call it a

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,760
Harvest

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
Festival which makes sense right cuz

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,319
what do kids love crops

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,480
oh once they start talking about corn

73
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,840
you can't get him to shut up about it

74
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,280
it's like move on with your

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,200
lives but we can't throw any Stones

76
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,159
right cuz who amongst us growing up

77
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,640
didn't have many a blast playing those

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,959
classic childhood games like t a field

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,959
and sort the grains the time did

80
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,400
fly I don't know I think it's kind of

81
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,120
ironic that the people most offended by

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Halloween are the same people that spend

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,799
a lot of their time in church you know

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
that building where people go to dress

85
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,440
up and pretend to be someone they're not

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,879
for a treat you know those um those

87
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,200
places I uh

88
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,799
all right could have used you on the

89
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,280
orange as the new Christ stuff but thank

90
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,280
you for

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,280
that

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,840
could and why isn't Halloween the

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,360
holiday we should be forced to spend

94
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,680
with our family right wouldn't that make

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,599
the most sense for our family's scariest

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,040
day of the year forget ghosts wait till

97
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:58,210
you find out what your aunt really

98
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:02,519
thinks of Black lives matter oh God

99
