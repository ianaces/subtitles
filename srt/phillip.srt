32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,159
went to start college I dropped out was

there to do it job I do get relief

44
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,560
though sometimes from certain people

45
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,160
it's an emotionally demanding job but

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,959
it's also pretty physically demanding

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,959
