because I can never remember anything

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,680

California if I can just jump ahead

531
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,440
three years when you were on uh radio

532
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,120
hour hour on

533
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:51,720
kppc there was a moment when Bergman

534
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:55,159
started this improv about uh being a a

535
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,000
drug taker a drug tester for the US

536
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,000
government he would he he started he

537
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,200
pretended to pop some things and Austin

538
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,279
says now you you're you're a federal

539
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,880
agent and you're in charge of the the

540
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:10,320
and Beren just cries and falls apart and

541
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,480
everybody is laughing their asses off

542
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,440
and this is why to to the guys in the

543
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,039
room this was so funny is because

544
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,679
Bergman was intentionally going back to

545

it what was the what was it what were

770
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
the contents of it what was your

771
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,079
fascination with it other than it was of

772
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,560
the time I'm curious now like what was

773
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,160
this interview like he was a

774
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,560
phenomenon and and his music was both

775
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,319
meditative and stimulating mhm at the

776
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:37,440
same time and he represented as the

777
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:39,400
Beatles later espoused he represented a

778
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,319
a blending of the East and the West the

779
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,000
cultures of the East and the West the

780
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:49,000
meditative culture uh the ancient

781
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,480
culture of India and the East China and

782
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,599
the rest and the the

783
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,240
musical uh

784
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,160
inspiration

785
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,800
of basically meditative

786
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:05,839
music like Peter used to play whirling

787
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:08,520
dervishes music on his show and Peter

788
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,400
was was in into medit meditation

789
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:15,520
meditative music from the very beginning

790
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,480
uh Peter's relationship to spiritualism

791
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,040
was I think somewhat

792
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:27,000
spurious but it was well-intentioned

793
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,240
yeah and uh and he did share that

794
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,960
cultural

795
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,440

796
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,520

798
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,440
it so uh it was part of the uh New Age

799
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,359

1005
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,599

later so that's that's the picture

1007
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,640

schedule for doing electrician though it

1158
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,400

1159
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,960
convenience like how did it

1160
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,720
go I can't tell I don't it was organic

1161
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,920
yeah it was organic everything kind of

1162
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:53,160
like flowed together yeah it was it was

1163
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:57,359
there wasn't nothing was

1164
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:01,400
formalized with the kind of of rigidity

1165
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:03,839
that you know people think is required

1166
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,319
to create art sure sure you know it's

1167
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:10,880
really more has to do with the talent

think we'll talk about in a future I

1311
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,599
think I think it might have to happen

1312
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,839
but can I tell you this was great

1313
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:43,440
because this is we didn't plan on this

1314
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:45,920
but come on like that's I don't know

1315
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,640
like it's it's definitely archival yeah

1316
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,039
exactly definitely AR typical and

1317
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,920
archival nobody is going to and I even

1318
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:56,359

1321
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,760
mean put it on the arc were any of these

1322
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,920
dates ever solidified in your brain

1323
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,640
before now this is uh this is good stuff

1324
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,000
I mean when I was I was really getting

1325
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,319
into trying to spelunk Phil's history

1326
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,960

doing the dear friends package and

1328
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,839

1410
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:03,839
involved with him besides the fact that

1411
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:07,119
I was a science fiction fan of harb's

1412
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:09,480
writings was that I saw that they cared

1413
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:12,720
about production and that they were

1414
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:15,079
doing Foley and that they were doing you

1415
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:18,400
know original sound effects and they

1416
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:21,680
were doing an original musical score key

1417
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:25,279

1460
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:37,040
transcribe uh a a uh Cabaret version of

1461
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:41,400
americathon really which is the version

1462
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:44,199
that was witnessed by uh Neil Israel who

1463
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:46,400
had directed me in tunnel vision and who

1464
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:50,279
said I want to make this into a movie

1465
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,640
yeah and uh I despaired of ever being

1466
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:56,000
able to do anything with it although we

1467
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:59,839
have some tapes of course of the shows

1468
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,040
but uh I found that Neil had done a

1469
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:05,920
transcription of our performances and

1470
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,480
it's a big old script but I'm going

1471
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,600
through it and transcribing it and I'll

1472
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,759
as as it reveals itself to me I'll see

1473
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,080
what format I can put it in yeah but I

1474
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:19,679

01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:43,120
movie yeah and could have become a movie

1507
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:44,719

change

1543
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:30,080
should they colonize them and send them

01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:31,080
away or should we integrate them into

1545
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,679
our

1546
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:36,120

01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:39,000
all these extraordinary men of his time

1548
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:42,120
he was in a duel with Henry Clay really

1549
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,080

you listen to Hamilton I can't afford

1555
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,600
see to see it but I've been listening to

01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,920
it just makes me cry while I'm driving

1557
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,280
which is probably dangerous but but you

1558
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,480
learn again how many of their sons were

1559
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,639
killed in these senseless duels and then

1560
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,520
Hamed it himself oh awful awful time but

1561
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:12,679
