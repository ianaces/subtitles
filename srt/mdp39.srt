week here's a good story I like to give

83
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,400
you a little tibbit from the from the

84
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,720
week went with my buddy Rick wood who's

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
a very funny comic I met out here in La

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,720
we go to garage sales sometimes on a

87
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,080
Sunday it's a fun thing to do well we

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,519
stopped off at a coffee bean and I

89
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,200
needed to use a bathroom and I noticed

90
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,760
there was a long line so I went next

91
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,840
door there was a bagel place I said can

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
you use the bathroom they said we don't

93
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,439
have a bathroom I was like oh I'm

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,959
getting desperate so I go to the other

95
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,799
side of the Coffee Bean and there's a

96
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,400
fancy brunch place and I noticed there's

97
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,040
a hostess at the greeting stand which is

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
generally where they stand at the

99
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,079
greeting stand and it's also where they

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,000
they stop people from going to the

101
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,560
bathroom in my experience who are not

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,640
customers or patrons of the restaurant

103
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,959
so I devised a plan very quickly in my

104
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,680
head I decided to pretend to make eye

105
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,319
contact with a table in the back of the

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
room so when I walked up to her I I

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,760
wasn't looking at her I was looking at

108
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,880
the table and I was fake waving to

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,440
nobody and she didn't think anything of

110
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,160
it so I just continued past her stand so

111
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,520
I get to the back area where there's a

112
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,639
line for the bathroom there's someone in

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,479
the bathroom and there's one guy ahead

114
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,720
of me online and me and the guy he's

115
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,160
like a real Jersey tough guy I don't I

116
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,280
don't even know who let him into La you

117
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,520
never see guys like this in La this is

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,360
like an East Coast guy I know them I

119
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,360
know them from being one and he's mad

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
and the guy he goes can you freaking

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,520
believe this can you freaking believe

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,560
this we got to wait for the bathroom in

123
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,320
a fancy restaurant like this can you

124
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,759
freaking believe I got to wait while

125
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,440
some my [ __ ] in there probably

126
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,199
didn't even pay to come into the

127
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,800
restaurant probably right off of the

128
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,400
street you know it's the problem with

129
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,560
these places he goes they just let and

130
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,639
by the way there's no way he could have

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
known that how I how I came to be in

132
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,320
that part of the restaurant just the way

133
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,960
it was set up he goes people you know I

134
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
bet they don't have good security here I

135
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,919
bet they're just letting any [ __ ] head

136
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,440
in off the street they need to use the

137
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,680
bathroom and they probably just let them

138
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,600
in while people like me and you have to

139
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,800
pay a ton of money and sit down and then

140
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,919
we don't we have to wait for these

141
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,039
people who aren't even part of the

142
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,440
restaurant to use a bathroom and I go

143
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,120

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,720
shocking shocking they they bet you they

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,160

for agreeing with me because I am I am

150
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,880
outraged about this and nobody ever

151
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,880
nobody ever agrees with me about this

152
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,759
but I'm telling you this they should be

153
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,560

154
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,280

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,319

people to come in they hey you need to

159
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,840

talking to the upper management we

166
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,639
should be this is I we need to protest

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
this is an outrage and then we hear the

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,440
toilet flush the guy who's in the in the

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,759
bathroom is obviously done and he and he

170
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,400

of I go ahead of him into the bathroom

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,440
I'm exactly the guy he's complaining

176
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,080
about it was like a small victory for me

177
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,639
cuz I I'm ABS I'm absolutely against

178
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,160
that everything that he was

179
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,639
saying he was just so damn intimidating

180
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,120
I decided to agree with him but I was AB

181
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,280
anybody who should use a bathroom in my

182
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,240
opinion should be allowed to use a

183
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,919
bathroom I think it's uh it's inhumane

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
to restrict people who need to use a

185
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,319
bathroom from using it and my friend

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
said when I told him the story he said

187
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,319
the only thing that would have been

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,479
funnier was if I used the of the toilet

189
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,759
paper in there and then he needed to use

190
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,000
it and he got

191
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,520
it oh my god well it was an absolute

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
pleasure getting to talk to Carl Riner

193
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,360
and you're going to get to hear that in

194
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,360
a second and the most amazing thing was

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,240
that after doing the interview he gave

196
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
me a call a few days later and invited

197
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,280
me for what was an incredible experience

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,960
where I got to spend an evening with him

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,720
and Mel Brooks and that's a whole

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,840
another story onto itself that maybe

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,800
I'll tell it some other time but it

202
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,960
there's a lot there's a lot for for me

203
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,199
to say about it and to be sitting with

204
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,199
these two Heroes of mine was uh well it

205
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,960
was it was more than just special I'll

206
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,759
tell you that it was it was incredibly

207
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,400
meaningful to me and we had a wonderful

208
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,080
time and we talked a lot and we talked

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,800
about music and at the end Carl gave me

210
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,759
some CDs that his late wife Estelle

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,319
Riner had recorded and I've been

212
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,759
listening to them all week and they're

213
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,919
just absolutely wonderful and they're

214
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,199
inspiring they're so inspiring

215
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,879
especially because of the fact that she

216
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,599
started her singing career in her 60s

217
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,400
and had a career for over 30

218
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,599
years and if that's not motivation for

219
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,479
anybody out there that if you have a

220
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,960
dream that you want to follow that it's

221
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,759
not too late you better go and do it

222
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,319
well nothing will be because I sometimes

223
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,039
get down about the fact that I'm 31 and

224
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,479
I see guys who are starting out in their

225
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,440
teens as Comedians and they're shooting

226
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,959
up to success and I feel old and I'm not

227
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,360
old I'm young and I've always dreamt of

228
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,839
being on Saturday Night Live and

229
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,120
sometimes I think well that dream can't

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,560
be anymore I'm 31 it's too late and I

231
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,560
and I got to tell you something this

232
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,039
really recharged my battery and it

233
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,320
really made me think you know what I'm

234
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,640
going to I'm going to go for it I'm

235
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,800

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,279

arguing no I'm I'm happy to be any place

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,720
you know when you get to be 92 you're

272
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,519
just happy that your brain is is working

273
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,320
enough so that you make sense of words

274
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,680
that come into your head and your

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,079
impressions are so spoton they used to

276
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,240
be good I used to was it young every

277
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,320
young comedian uses Impressions to get

278
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,800
into the to put their foot in the door

279
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,079
everybody wants to hear about the great

280
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,760
stars and you give them a taste of it I

281
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,639
think more your generation than mine

282
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,800
were very big on Impressions the

283
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,680
comedian absolutely you don't hear them

284
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,519
now there there are only one or two

285
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,959
really good Impressionists around these

286
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,360
days do you think it became a taboo or

287
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:10,040
what do you think it is I have no idea

288
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:13,240
Governor really I have no idea I also

289
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,920
have no idea why people are so enamored

290
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,279
of these rappers and and they they don't

291
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,000
say very much but they say a lot they

292
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,160
use a lot of words to say

293
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,440
nothing and uh and I would rather

294
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,399
hear pencils I'd rather hear a song with

295
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,399
lyrics I guess that's why not too many

296
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,800
of them tweet you don't see too many

297
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,959
rappers on Twitter I I tweet a lot I

298
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,120
tweet every day I enjoy your tweets oh

299
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:41,399
you do that's good that's one of the

300
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,040
things that tweet teaches you a synness

301
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,000
yeah as a writer for so many years is

302
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,880
that a skill that You' already crafted

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,440
before Twitter I imagine I guess yes I I

304
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,639
realized that I'm I didn't even know I

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,959
was a writer until I the book started

306
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,320
coming out I mean I I think I became a

307
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,560
writer because in the Army I was

308
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,600
separated from my wife for three almost

309
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,360
two two and a half three years and we

310
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,680
wrote every day and I wrote four or five

311
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,519
page letters a day once I wrote her 17

312
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,480
letters of six pages in one day and that

313
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,160
be really I think that's how I thoughted

314
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,120
to become a writer do you think emails

315
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,040
nowadays have the same effect as letters

316
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,160
or no not at all so no they're not as

317
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,639
personal and not as long and there's not

318
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,480
you know this and it's not a phone call

319
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,199
is better see my girlfriend all the time

320
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
but I don't think we we have that strong

321
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,320
of uh written connection as I would if

322
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,760

older than me so she's this year's her

361
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:23,079
hund would have been her 100th year

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,920
right I look at the every morning I wake

363
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,120
up and I watch I first thing I read is

364
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,320
the old bits to see what age people are

365
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,800
going so whether they're and they're

366
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,600
mostly younger than I am today there

367
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,480
were a couple hundred year olds that was

368
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,040
very heartening right do you think if

369
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,680
the ages just got higher and higher

370
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,399
you'd have more and more hope is that

371
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,199
what you're yes you do absolutely well

372
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,800

375
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,199
if you could live to be any age how old

376
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,120
would you want to live uh as long as I'm

377
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:03,519

378
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,440
all right once things start to hurt and

379
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,040

you fall down a lot you know what once

381
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,360
your while your brain is working it

382
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,440

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,360
that I'd remembered it and all these

514
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640

worth selling so you're there for a

577
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,360
purpose usually I remember going on

578
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,640
Carson a few times and having nothing to

579
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,480

have nothing to sell come on anyway he

581
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,520
said do you get nerves when you go on TV

582
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,200
not really did you ever yeah the proper

583
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,520
proper amount of nerves yeah you just

584
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,880
worry that you you don't trip or

585
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,240
something but no when you when you go on

586
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,679
with people you who you trust you know

587
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,600
they're going to ask you to co it's when

588
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,440
you go on with some who doesn't how to

589
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,240
interview that it makes it tough then

590
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,840
you just take it over and go right you

591
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,679
never get self-conscious only if my fly

592
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,320
is open and they find out later yeah you

593
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,600
know I when I'm on stage I always get

594
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,279
paranoid my fly is open at some point

595
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,840
when I'm on stage I'm not kidding you

596
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,200
almost every time I've done a show where

597
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,279
it's like an hourong show at some point

598
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,440
in the show I'm thinking I hope my fly

599
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,320
is not

600
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,880
open that's why why why is it going so

601
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,880
well

602
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,799
yeah well you see where they the look at

603
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,919
the people's eyes see if their eyes are

604
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:12,120
on your forehead or they're on your

605
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,279
crotch it's a good trick yes what if if

606
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,559
they're moving around then you you got

607
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,440
to be more interesting than the fly you

608
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,120
know if I'm more interesting than an

609
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,880
open fly then I'm really good I think

610
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,039
that's the trick maybe to being the best

611
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,000
comedian yes you got to go up with an

612
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,679
open fly every time till you get so

613
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,640
strong that the people can only focus on

614
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,480
you and not the fly yeah that's right if

615
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,080
you're if you have an open fly and you

616
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,720
can keep them looking at your face

617
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,080
you're really a great comedian that's

618
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,600
got to be the secret to it all

619
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,240
absolutely

620
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,720

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,279
office I gave him a comb over and his

717
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,559
wife said oh this is so much nice you

718
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:51,200
don't have the same thing and I cont I

719
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:53,480
say I contributed to his to his uh

720
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,120
successes uh one of the probably the

721
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,760
greatest writer in in our in our country

722
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,960
of plays play right could be because of

723
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,360
the haircut maybe would I no question he

724
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,200
would have been dismissed otherwise no

725
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,360
question about it they looked at his

726
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,840
plays instead of his hair you mention in

727
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,320
your first book your relationship with

728
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,559
the tup pays that you used to have the

729
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,000
toupe so it's like an ongoing theme the

730
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,840
hair yes I well I never actually uh I

731
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,799
always wore didn't I never wore a toue

732
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,240
when I went normal living and I remember

733
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,480
meeting Frederick Murray who wore a toue

734
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,679
all the time and he says you're not

735
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,720
wearing a pay how do you decide when to

736
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,440
wear it I said well it's a it's like a

737
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,320
tuxedo you you want to get dressed up if

738
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,240
you want to be fully dressed and make an

739
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,600
impression of handsomeness or to I said

740
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,799
I never wear it if there's less than a

741
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,200
thousand people I said if I go to an

742
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,799
event and there if you want to be I

743
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,000
won't wear it and I always made a big

744
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,519
point of where when I wore it I would

745
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,919
say I'm wearing my two pain tonight it's

746
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,679
an important event you know cuz I was

747
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,960
never wanted people to look at my head

748
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,279
and I said it in the book people say is

749
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,600
that a toe you're wearing you'd say yes

750
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,120
and they say you know you can you can

751
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,799
never tell you can't know right it is

752
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,039
unfair to make people stand there and

753
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,640
wonder it's the same maybe the combover

754
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,519
is more honest than the person with a

755
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,519
toupe that doesn't let you know that's

756
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,840
right you know it's it's interesting CU

757
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:22,360
My Generation you don't see Tays and and

758
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,080
you never see coover so I think there

759
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,519
were definitely people like you that

760
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,960
made a stand at some point in in history

761
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,159
and said we're going to bald and and

762
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,720
that's and that's cool I put Larry David

763
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:36,360
in the group oh yes absolutely Fighters

764
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,880
for the bald

765
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,640
Community yes be honest because now

766
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,720
people are are happy to be bald so I

767
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,440
think I think you changed the world

768
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,120
maybe that maybe we're talking to one

769
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,640
last hold out who's still has his hand

770
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,399
right on his head right now as we're

771
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,440
talking not me

772
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,440
no it's so funny uh so many of your

773
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,480
memories

774
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,159
are in my head now with the transfer of

775
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,360
you know through the books I feel like

776
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:06,679
I've gotten to also live your life I

777
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,120
feel like I really know you you don't

778
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,880
know me it's unfair you know Mel who

779
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,320
sits there every night almost right

780
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,760
there he says you know I've written like

781
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,799
five or six I I don't know how many

782
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,159
books I written five six seven I wrote

783
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:25,080
only one novel which was called

784
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:27,519
um all kinds of love and I've written

785
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,960
but they're all bi biographical I've

786
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,320
written I write a and I realize it's the

787
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,000
easiest thing to write about you don't

788
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,480
have to research it it's there and

789
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,440
things pop in your head why is it so

790
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,799
important to you to preserve these

791
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,960
memories it's not important it's just

792
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,279
fun it's just for fun yeah yeah fun I

793
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,360
don't think it's important no it it's

794
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:52,639
important it is important in the sense

795
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:55,840
that I once discovered not too long ago

796
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:58,519
that I'm a really the world's M the

797
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,080
world's MC I'm a master ceremonies at

798
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,279
heart I've been able to do it since I'm

799
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,840
18 17 18 years old when I went away to

800
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,320
the mountains I was able to do game

801
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,760
shows and introduce people without even

802
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,919
with no script I would just get out

803
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,639
there and be funny and I get I never

804
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,440
have anything prepared I just get up and

805
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:18,960
it's a gift that I have and it's being

806
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,039
an MC is pointing to people and saying

807
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,000
here look at this guy you're going to

808
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,200
really enjoy it Steve Allen was the

809
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,880
biggest one for that he loved getting to

810
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,120
point to people and say look at this guy

811
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,679
look what he does I've done that all my

812
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,320
life and I've done it very comfortably

813
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:37,279
without ever I never have to prepare I

814
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,440
never do prepare if I prepare it's going

815
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,760
to come out stilted so having read both

816
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,720
of your books and I try to figure out as

817
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,080
any young comedian would what what makes

818
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,240
somebody successful what makes somebody

819
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,519
successful in life not just in comedy

820
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,679
and what struck me from your books is

821
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,440
your ability to think very quickly on

822
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,320
your your feet it helps yes it helps uh

823
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,919
and you and and the same thing happens

824
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,399
in front of the typewriter you're

825
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:11,000
thinking on your keyboard very quickly

826
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,440
and you're changing all the time it's

827
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,440
you never somebody says you never finish

828
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,000
a an art project you you stop right

829
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,120
that's right and I today I was ready to

830
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,399
type I wait this and I fix and I really

831
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,960
improved it there's no question about

832
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,440
making improvements but you can keep

833
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,840
improving forever

834
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,559
the thing that strikes me as the best

835
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,279
example is in your first book when you

836
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,880
talked about the FBI interrogating you

837
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,279
oh yes as a communist yes yes and how

838
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,639
quick and sharp you were with your

839
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,519
responses well I decided right away I

840
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:45,080
was they were charming and I said I'm

841
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,159
going to out charm them and going to

842
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,639
going if they you if they have nothing

843
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,919
to lean against if they're pushing

844
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:53,000
against and you're pushing back they'll

845
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,760
push hard it so you wor you fall over

846
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,720
together so I I was reading that and I

847
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,440
was thinking what if I was in that

848
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,159
situation IM I would be there would be

849
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,080
fear it there was definitely fear but

850
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,399
there's also the a very good actor I was

851
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,480
acting feess you were acting FS but you

852
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,839
were fear fearful course of course in

853
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,200
the back of my head I said my God

854
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,440
everything can go down it was the

855
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,040
McCarthy era they were looking for

856
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,879
Communists and there was all started

857
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:25,639
with a a grosser up in New York Ryan New

858
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,119
York is a place looking for Communists

859
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,119
everywhere I hear people talk about how

860
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,280
now with the NSA listening in on phone

861
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,079
calls and and everything it's becoming

862
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,399
like that again as somebody who's been

863
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,760
through it do you think that's true well

864
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,159
unless they use

865
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,599
it everybody knows what everybody's

866
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,800
doing with my God your

867
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,879
phones it's unless somebody uses it

868
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,480
nefariously it doesn't matter I don't

869
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,079
care if they know what they know about

870
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,159
me you don't think we're heading to

871
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,119
another time like that I don't think so

872
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,760
I think it's so open that it's going to

873
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,720
be yeah

874
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,400
they will use pieces of information

875
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,520
badly you know the right-wing has been

876
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,200
doing it all the time they got a piece

877
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,320
of almost

878
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,760
information John Stewart God bless him

879
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,760
he puts it right out there so perfectly

880
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,400
and Co the two guys for for and Rachel M

881
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,320
there are certain people who know how to

882
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,520
tell you what the truth is the Fox

883
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,400
network makes up facts and then they

884
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,680
they act on them they continue to act on

885
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,880
facts they've made up that's why I love

886
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,640
Mark Twain he put it all out there for

887
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,440
everybody he was the best ever what

888
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,920
about him specifically well he covered

889
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,440
every subject in the world that was

890
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,839
worth covering and uh as a matter of

891
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,000
fact

892
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,640
he 50 years after he died they published

893
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,400
a thing called letters from the earth

894
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,200

and governments tick that's in it I mean

926
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,640
for all time it's brilliant it's

927
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,680
absolutely

928
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,920
brilliant and he wrote a thing called

929
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,119
what is man A little short book what is

930
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,119
man and he this I never even thought he

931
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,400
says what is

932
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,280
selflessness what is selfishness and

933
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,680
what is

934
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,319
selflessness he he everybody fixing

935
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,720
they're selfless he says everybody is

936
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:37,920
selfish there's very little selflessness

937
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,839
he said well what about

938
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,280
the selfless act he says like uh if

939
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,079
somebody saw a little F fall in the

940
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,800
water and you jump in to save somebody's

941
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,040
life isn't that selfless no is that

942
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,119
selfish you would not be able to live

943
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,560
with yourself if you not didn't do that

944
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,359
there are certain things you do because

945
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,640
you know you can't live with yourself if

946
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,680
you didn't do them if you didn't help a

947
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,640
a person in need and selfishness really

948
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,599
exists so there is no truly selfless

949
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,760
person actor person he that's what he's

950
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,280
saying you know I it's it's a small book

951
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,599
what ises man is worth three man he told

952
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,720
man he talks to man you know man God God

953
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,319
man is God man or whatever it seems this

954
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,160
seems like a perfect transition into

955
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:25,640
philosophy since that's basically what

956
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,480
we're talking about anyway so the

957
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,280
philosopher that I have chosen for you

958
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,640
is somebody I'm sure you're familiar

959
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,720
with I'm not okay well then because I

960
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,920
haven't read many philosop books on

961
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,040
philosophy well do you know about Moses

962
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:43,319
myones I've heard of him he's the the

963
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,960
the big Guru of the of the of our sect

964
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:47,880
right yes what did he say the ROM bomb

965
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,920
ROM bom he said a lot of things I that I

966
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,280
knew I knew about the ROM bom I I don't

967
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,359
know what he said maybe I'll know the

968
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,119
quote you're going to get um well I'll

969
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,240
tell you why we chose him for you okay

970
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,000
uh we we chose him because of your

971
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,720
famous record with Mel Brooks the

972
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
2,000-year old man right right and uh

973
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,880
figured you're half the record all right

974
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,480
my Mones is a thousand years old that's

975
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,400
a thousand each so I'll give you a

976
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,359
thousand- year old philosopher okay half

977
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:18,800
a 2,000 year old man my Mones was born

978
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:21,760
in 1135 and lived to 1204 69 years and

979
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,839
he lived in Cairo Egypt my monties

980
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,359
thinks that our minds are the tool to

981
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,040
find truth but we must accept that they

982
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:30,400
are flawed tools

983
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,160
for example let's examine proving the

984
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,640
existence of God myones is a proponent

985
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:40,640
of negative theory meaning we describe

986
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,640
God based on what he isn't he never dies

987
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,240
he is not confined to one form if we

988
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,240
attempt to describe God by what he is

989
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,520
eternal we are putting our finite Vision

990
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,119
on an infinite thing and hence doing it

991
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,520
in Justice well first of all I'll

992
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,400
discuss with you your thoughts on God

993
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,839
cuz I well you know I think I've got my

994
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,240
monties beat I got to figure it out oh

995
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,920
yeah yes a long time ago I'm under

996
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,960
confirmed died in the wo atheist I know

997
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,960
I'm an atheist and and when people say

998
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:19,319
how can you be an atheist I says well

999
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,200
let's take God I said you are God man is

1000
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:25,119
God human beings have invented God

1001
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:28,000
because they needed him I says every

1002
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,000
thought ever done is done by man

1003
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,160
nobody put the thought in your head you

1004
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,079
had the thought very a long long time

1005
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,480
ago I said when Moses went up the side

1006
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,560
of the mountain and there was always

1007
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,920
smart men in society one smart guy a

1008
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,800
little smarter than everybody else and

1009
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,040
and somebody gave this example once and

1010
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,119
I never forgot it they said during the

1011
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:55,359
um the methal days human beings did not

1012
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,920
know from whence came children where did

1013
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,640
children come from how did they come how

1014
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,520
did they get it took a very smart

1015
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,079
Neanderthal to put together the sex act

1016
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,160
and the birth act they were months apart

1017
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:11,760
nine months apart nobody ever said if

1018
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,280
you do that this happens they didn't

1019
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,960
know it one smart guy said hey this guy

1020
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,160
never did that and he never had that so

1021
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,880
maybe that's and one it's always one man

1022
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,480
who figured out something there's always

1023
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,760
one brighter person it has been

1024
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:30,079
throughout centuries you know we have U

1025
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,000
you know Freud and Marx and Christ and

1026
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,000
people who thought Moses went up on the

1027
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,400
hill and I'm I'm sure this is absolutely

1028
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,200
true the synchronistic thing of a

1029
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,480
lightning striking when he's getting

1030
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,560
these ideas I really think there was a

1031
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,880
thunderbolt when he was writing down

1032
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,480
these things but those were his ideas

1033
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,920
Thou shalt not you know cover thy

1034
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,920
neighbor's wife thou sh and and I said

1035
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,560
those things were put down and when he

1036
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,760
came down he said look at the ideas I

1037
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,359
came down with they said who are you

1038
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,200
he's look at the ideas that came down

1039
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:02,119
that God has given me to give you

1040
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,359
because the Flesh of lightning came and

1041
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,800
I said so man needed God because he

1042
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,520
there were things happening they had

1043
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,440
nothing to know you know they used to

1044
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,440
pray to rocks they pray to a con cell

1045
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,520
they they picked before they had a the

1046
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,800
monotheism they prayed to many gods they

1047
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,480
had you know crazy looking statues they

1048
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,480
were praying to do you think that means

1049
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,520
there's a need for prayer it's a need to

1050
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,119
know and they don't know how to who will

1051
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,760
answer their their really profound

1052
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,240
questions where did I come from how did

1053
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,119
I get here what are we doing here and I

1054
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:42,200
said men is God he has figured it out my

1055
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,040
God the things he's figured out how we

1056
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,559
are now living to 80 90 years old

1057
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,720
because we know how to kill diseases

1058
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:50,359
that used to kill you like this in the

1059
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,000
desert my God you know and people got

1060
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:56,520
smart very very early on I said you know

1061
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,839
that my father used to tell me about the

1062
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,040
one of the

1063
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,000
traditions in Jewish uh culture is when

1064
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,319
you cut your fingernails you burn them

1065
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,319
you put them in a thing and burn them I

1066
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:10,599
said where did that come from he says in

1067
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:13,280
the desert you know he said um a lot of

1068
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:16,680
dirt on the fingernails the and they

1069
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,440
they said mikum devils are on in in dirt

1070
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,920
under the fingernails so they got to get

1071
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,079
rid of them otherwise you'll get sick

1072
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:27,160
and they knew about figured out there

1073
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:29,640
was an unseen thing called mikum germs

1074
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,720
man very way early back man is smart

1075
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,079
then they figured out they got

1076
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,839
telescopes they invented microscopes and

1077
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:38,000
telescopes and all those things so man

1078
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:41,680
is very very smart and he needed God and

1079
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,040
I say those who who use God who doesn't

1080
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,920
exist as for Comfort I said it's all

1081
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,640

00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,119
you use for

1085
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,200
comfort the fact that I know there's no

1086
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:02,319

something out there's a guy thing called

she has written

1099
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,960
about what how the mind works and what

1100
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,680
what it does to the body and it's an

1101
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,839
extraordinary piece of work so but it's

1102
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,040
a person it's I know she's a person

1103
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,440
she's my daughter have you ever prayed

1104
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,920

1105
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,040
yourself you know oh come on let's this

1106
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,880
yeah sure of course I don't it's not I'm

1107
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,920
not praying to anything you're hoping

1108
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,720
that's what it is you're hope you're

1109
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,640
hoping that this works out what what

1110
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,920
going back to the idea with the Jews I

1111
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,000
always think about this as a Jew what

1112
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,839
why why do you think we've been

1113
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:06,920
persecuted so so much I have no idea uh

1114
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,480
well you know something uh people who

1115
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,280
don't have

1116
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,000
much sometimes Elevate themselves by

1117
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:19,319
making somebody lower than them making

1118
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,520
somebody a scapegoat for your in in in

1119
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,880
inabilities saying they they they're

1120
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,240
Terri I think that's it and because they

1121
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,599
were they were literate I think they

1122
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,559
were very UPS said that they were

1123
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,520
illiterate and did things a lot that the

1124
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:34,359
pagans couldn't do but they but they

1125
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,280
weren't weren't Waring they weren't

1126
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:39,760
warlike at one point at one point they

1127
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,520
were you know they were they did do

1128
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,760
conquering battle and what was it the

1129
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,880
Philistines and sure the King David

1130
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,640
times yeah we had a we had a few good

1131
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,079
War years yes

1132
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,760
absolutely having fought in World War I

1133
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,520
you must have thought about this quite a

1134
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,680
bit over the years right oh my God that

1135
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,800
was the fact that that a a a whole

1136
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:07,359
billions millions of people could accept

1137
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:10,000
them a maniac that goals or guring GBL

1138
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,640
figured out a way to get all the people

1139
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,480
in the country together United by hating

1140
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:21,280
something and they pick on the Jews who

1141
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:24,079
were rif for rating at the time because

1142
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,079
uh they were different you know anybody

1143
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,200
anyway so that was the thing I will

1144
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,160
never ever understand why all those

1145
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,040
people went along with it and I never

1146
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,680
forgive them for that for and and and I

1147
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,280
I praised those people there was a book

1148
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,559
who just came out I just ordered it

1149
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,400
about a guy who was writing about

1150
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:45,720
against Hitler for years in years in

1151
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,240
Germany a new book it's been one of the

1152
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,359
biggest books in Europe for hundreds the

1153
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,720
dozens of years just came here I just

1154
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:55,400
ordered it I forgot the name of it

1155
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,800
anyway I I think it's interesting I mean

1156
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,440
I I grew up was sent to Yeshiva so I

1157
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,400
grew up very religious and moved away

1158
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,559
from it now I moved back towards it I

1159
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,559
think I believe that belief in God is

1160
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,119
something that's either instilled in you

1161
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:16,359
when you're young or not it's true my

1162
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,960
father didn't go to sh or synagogue he

1163
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:20,319
believed in God but he didn't go to

1164
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,040
synagogue and my friends all went to

1165
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,400
synagogue and the only reason I went is

1166
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,599
to not be alone on the high holidays I

1167
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,200
went with them that we didn't have to

1168
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,160
pay in those days but I I never took it

1169
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,319
seriously do you think there's any value

1170
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,160
to any of it the Traditions or anything

1171
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,319
oh Traditions are always if the

1172
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,440
Traditions have good things in them sure

1173
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,800
they're good you know the the tradition

1174
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,040
of getting together for dinner for for

1175
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,400
for family to get to dinner forc them to

1176
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,359
get to get dinner during SATA that's

1177
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,559
lovely yeah but to pray to somebody who

1178
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:54,119
doesn't exist is you know is pray look

1179
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:57,160
unto yourself look until I own self be

1180
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,280
true and you'll be okay

1181
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,559
organized religion and my first thing

1182
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,920
that comes to my mind is the Catholic

1183
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:06,680
Church which they really not how to

1184
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,000
organize my wife and I went to Mexico

1185
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,960
City one day and we went to guadalahara

1186
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,280
to saw that absolutely magnificent

1187
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Temple we were on the day of Ascension

1188
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,400
when people are crawling on their hands

1189
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:23,280
and knees to give arms to the church

1190
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:26,040
these poor people be dragged people in

1191
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,000
tatters with their knees bleeding

1192
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:31,599
crawling the Last Mile to the church

1193
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,760
with an with a little token of money

1194
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,960
which they laid on the the church's

1195
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,359
step and I'm saying and I'm looking at

1196
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,800
this gold door and I'm saying there it

1197
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,599
is there's what you that's ridiculous

1198
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,760
the pope is walking around with with

1199
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,680
these gold shoes and a gold hat and

1200
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,599
millions of people are praying to him

1201
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,319
and what do they get back they get back

1202
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,480
peace right we'll give you peace Eternal

1203
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,559
peace so you never believed in your

1204
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,680
whole life no even as a kid and a kid I

1205
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,799
probably did I mean I my course I went

1206
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:10,799
to show my I know I probably

1207
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:12,240
didn't no I my father said he did so I

1208
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:15,839
guess I did well I'm going to keep

1209
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,280
reading the myi stuff we can keep we can

1210
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,760
okay keep analyzing it there is one

1211
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,040
disease which is widespread and from

1212
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,680
which men rarely escape the disease

1213
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,720
varies in degree in different men I

1214
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,119
refer to this that every person thinks

1215
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,200
his mind more clever and more learned

1216
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,319
than it is I have found that this

1217
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,119
disease has attacked many an intelligent

1218
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:40,280
person they express themselves not only

1219
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:43,000
upon the science with which they're

1220
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,760
familiar but upon other Sciences about

1221
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,440
which they know nothing if met with

1222
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,720
Applause so does this disease itself

1223
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:53,200
become

1224
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,799
aggravated just because somebody thinks

1225
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,839
they're they're smart it doesn't mean

1226
00:49:54,799 --> 00:50:01,040
they're smart I mean you're can be

1227
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,920
educated but not inventive smart and

1228
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,680
those people kid themselves when they

1229
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,280
think that they because they have

1230
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,079
learned all the things they were taught

1231
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,520
to learn they they had they had a a way

1232
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,960
of digesting stuff that was invented by

1233
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,240
somebody else and they and they learned

1234
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:22,280
it and they became doctors they became

1235
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:25,960
lawyers judges but people who think

1236
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,960
clearly about things innovatively MH

1237
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,359
those are those are those those are the

1238
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,960
real thinkers those are the real and

1239
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:35,720
most people ordinary people can have

1240
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,559
that and never be um never be lorded as

1241
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,839
doctors you know right I think there's a

1242
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,240
difference Common Sense between being

1243
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:44,200
clever and being intelligent and being

1244
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,119
being educated You Can Be You Can Be

1245
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,000
Clever and you don't you can be educated

1246
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,280
and be very dumb

1247
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,480
too give me an example well learning

1248
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,160
things by

1249
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,000
roote really understanding what makes

1250
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,440
people tick what makes things tick it's

1251
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,319
a rare it's a rare gift and some some

1252
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,680
people some people who have degrees have

1253
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,280
that but most people don't I don't think

1254
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,160
do you think the older you get the more

1255
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,559
you understand if you understood it a

1256
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,920
little at the beginning you will and

1257
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:18,079
continue on that path if you never

1258
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,920
understood you will never understand and

1259
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,880
you will think you understand and make

1260
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,160
fun of people who think they understand

1261
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,440
right so so you have to have something

1262
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,720
to build on

1263
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,079
are you still as young in your mind as

1264
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,240
you were I think so I think so because

1265
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:40,000
I'm able to come up with things that uh

1266
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:43,760
are new for me and so at 92 if if I can

1267
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,240
do that I will stay around as long as

1268
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:51,640
that keeps going what about marriage in

1269
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:55,119
this business of Comedy so many fail

1270
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:57,319
and how do you balance a a brilliant

1271
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,280
career in Show Business like you did and

1272
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:01,160
a and a good relationship is there a

1273
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,920
trick to that yeah sure there is a trick

1274
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,799
my wife he once said it somebody asked

1275
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,640
of her right there sitting

1276
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:11,599
there what makes a a good

1277
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,640
marriage she says how do you how do you

1278
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:17,400
live so long she said she says marry

1279
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,079
someone who can stand

1280
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:23,200
you now you can stand who can stand you

1281
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,040
if you can stand all the little

1282
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,280
picadillos you don't leave you well if

1283
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,040
it's your right and you hang in there

1284
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,119
because you marry that person for a

1285
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,400
reason in the first place and you forget

1286
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,680
it sometimes because so many things come

1287
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,559
come into the

1288
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,880
mix positive and negative things but uh

1289
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:43,640
where are you going if you if you get

1290
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,480
divorce you'll only do it again you make

1291
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:49,559
the same mistake twice now we were

1292
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:52,640
married for 65 years and and uh it was

1293
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:54,760
they were great great re to this day I I

1294
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,160
say I made a little adage in one of the

1295
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,760
books you noticed the new adage which is

1296
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,000
70 is the new 65 when people ask me how

1297
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,680
long have I've been married I say 65 and

1298
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,680
one day it occurred to me he right my

1299
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,680
wife was married 65 years but I'm still

1300
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:11,400
married she's still within me I think of

1301
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,599
her all the time so I'm married 70 years

1302
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:17,799
so I'm saying that's the new ad 70 is

1303
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:21,319
new 65 and sadly you can apply you can

1304
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:23,240
change it to 50 is the new 45 or sadly

1305
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:25,119
12 is the new seven you know depending

1306
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,160
on how long right you stay married

1307
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,480
before one passes on

1308
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,880
as I get older I feel like time moves

1309
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,240
faster it does no question about it so

1310
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:39,000
at 92 does it continue to I think it's

1311
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,599
slowing down no it doesn't oh it doesn't

1312
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,760
I I don't think it moves faster I'm

1313
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:45,880
moving slower that's what it is yeah I

1314
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,400
really move slower and I'm very aware of

1315
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,960
it when I walk around a block very aware

1316
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,000
of it I I found it fascinating in your

1317
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,359
book how you talked so much about how

1318
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,920
you think about your own mortality one

1319
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,559
one line in your book that that made me

1320
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:03,200
laugh out loud was the idea that the

1321
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:06,640
mortician would admire your

1322
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,280
toenails yeah long time ago I was when I

1323
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,359
used to run around the track at Beverly

1324
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:14,040
Hill so I was running a mile a day for

1325
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:16,799
every day and I had fine looking

1326
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:20,280
toenails and all of a sudden they got I

1327
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:23,000
got ingrown and they were had to go to

1328
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,880
dietr and and he says wait a second he I

1329
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,119
said what happened he says I said I'm

1330
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,280
wearing is you wearing the wrong

1331
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,000
size shoe I said I'm wearing a 10 which

1332
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,680
is my size he 10 and a half is your size

1333
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,480
you're banging up against the shoe when

1334
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,760
you run so I got a bigger shoe and he

1335
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,079
gave me something to to put on the nail

1336
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,160
it took years till they straighten out

1337
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:46,319
again so both nails look good and I put

1338
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:49,680
this little stuff on it but I have shoes

1339
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:52,160
that so I said they look perfect and I

1340
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,040
took pictures of it I said when someday

1341
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:57,359
mortici is going to say look at the a

1342
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:59,200
92y old man or 95 whatever yeah he's got

1343
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,200
very young Nails hopefully he's as

1344
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,880
attentive to detail as you are I says

1345
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,240
well if he reads this if he gets the

1346
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,440
chance to read the book he'll find out

1347
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,880
how he can have a young nail yeah I

1348
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,760
think anytime if if I was a mortician

1349
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,799
anytime I had someone die who had a book

1350
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,880
out about their life I'd want I want to

1351
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:17,319
read it

1352
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,960
before but also you're a comedian you

1353
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:20,559
pick apart the little things I don't

1354
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,720
know that most people do that I don't

1355
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,760
know that most people would pay

1356
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,000
attention to the toenails yeah if a

1357
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,799
comedian was was taking care of the body

1358
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,839
almost 100% they would say that yeah

1359
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:31,480
yeah you you think about everything why

1360
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,680
do you think we do that as comedians why

1361
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:39,400
do we observe that's that's why we're

1362
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:41,400
ComEd that's why people um enjoy

1363
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,160
comedians because they do notice the

1364
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,880
things that people would have noticed

1365
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,359
did notice but didn't take note of you

1366
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,280
know they been passing by but they and

1367
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,960
you you pointed and they start thinking

1368
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,119
about oh my God I have the same thing

1369
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,000
and I and they laugh they laugh in

1370
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,480
recognition you're talking about them

1371
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,680
talking about their relation to their

1372
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,440
wife their relation to their kids what

1373
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,559
if we were just called noticers instead

1374
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,400
of comedians yeah notices right well

1375
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:09,640
this next noticer he notices a lot

1376
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,520
you're going to love this guy nothing

1377
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:14,039
gets past

1378
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,000
him well what talking about the big

1379
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:18,319
questions that you say people invent God

1380
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,039
to answer these big questions what do

1381
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,400
you make of them what do you think is

1382
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:25,000
the purpose of life what do you

1383
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,039
think that's the point the purpose of

1384
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:34,200
life uh as far as I'm concerned is not

1385
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:36,640
to foul not to foul uh the atmosphere or

1386
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,720
to send nourishing people into the world

1387
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,920
bring children into the world with a

1388
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,000
good sense of values that do not impress

1389
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:50,079
oppress other

1390
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:53,160
people just a good people and by by

1391
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:55,200
example make make for a better world for

1392
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,640
the sake of discussion I I'll ask you

1393
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,680
why why is it important important to

1394
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,799
have a good

1395
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:04,039
World

1396
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:06,640
well the we are we are we have only we

1397
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:08,000
have one planet and way we don't think

1398
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,440
I'm thinking about the guy who reads

1399
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,640
about says the the the planet is doomed

1400
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:19,039
to doomed to to die within 9 million

1401
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:22,079
years 9 billion whatever 9 billion years

1402
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,839
right and he says did he what did he say

1403
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,559
he said 9 billion Oh I thought he said 9

1404
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:29,200
million yeah

1405
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:33,200
I don't know why we

1406
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:36,799
think yeah uh what do you make of death

1407
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:39,160
what do you think death is it's it's

1408
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:41,480
going into the the best sound sleep

1409
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,720
you've ever had where you really sleep

1410
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,280
and you wake up in the morning you don't

1411
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,000
have a you've had no dreams and just

1412
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,160
come from you fall asleep and that's it

1413
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,280
there's nothing I really think there's a

1414
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,280
part of you that's very poetic not just

1415
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,680
the the one about Lois but there there's

1416
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,359
definitely a a poetry to the way you

1417
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,200
write one line from your book that that

1418
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:05,400
stuck with me that I thought was

1419
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:08,119
particularly poetic was I'm happy every

1420
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,119
day that I have a

1421
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,839
shadow Yeah well yeah I was leaning on

1422
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,720
the wall and I saw my shadow and I said

1423
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:19,359
oh if you have a shadow you're alive you

1424
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,799

1425
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:27,720
life in in in your aging body yeah the

1426
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:30,720

1430
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,440
we've talked on the show before about uh

1431
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,200
Carlin and the euphemisms the passing

away checking out's a good one yeah

1433
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:50,160
checking out I I have not chapter I love

1434
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:53,400
the title of checkups of lay checkouts

1435
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:56,799
mhm CU one day I found out I had just

1436
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:59,400
accidentally I had uh point with three

1437
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,319
or four four or five doctors all

1438
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,160
accidental one was a hearing doctor one

1439
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:06,799
was a foot doctor one was a for my ear

1440
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,799
something but there was uh just

1441
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:11,160
accidentally I saw in my book I said how

1442
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:14,160
did they all come on one day so and I

1443
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,400
realized but the more times you checkup

1444
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:19,240
your check out you're probably putting

1445
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,400
years onto your life so checkups laay

1446
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,079
checkouts that was a good title chapter

1447
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,480
yeah I like that one and how you got n

1448
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,960
nine in in two days and the interesting

1449
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,319
thing is I could never think of the word

1450
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,480
La after that I was saying what the

1451
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:35,839
hell's the name of that chapter I can't

1452
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,240
I never use the word la la

1453
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:42,160
right the words come to you is you need

1454
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:45,079
them they store in a place that is cold

1455
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:47,680
storage until you for some reason your

1456
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:50,359
your brain starts heating up melts the

1457
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,000
cold storage and words flop down out of

1458
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:54,319
the cold stores that you never knew you

1459
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,880
knew that's an always a thing that

1460
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,280
surprises me I didn't know I knew that

1461
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:01,400
word word yeah it's it's all up there I

1462
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,160
even know how to spell it

1463
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,680
yeah I I felt good as an overweight guy

1464
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,359
when I read about the shadow I thought

1465
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,400
hey I got a lot of Shadow by the way I'm

1466
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,480

01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,839
overweight before you leave every time I

1468
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,720
read about it you're cutting years off

1469
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:18,440
your life and it's and it when you find

1470
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:21,319
out there is a way to do it that makes

1471
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:23,400
sense it's unbelievable I mean I'm

1472
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:26,880
watching I just happened to see Maria

1473
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,880
Osman she was like this she

1474
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,400
and there are so many ways to do it but

1475
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,119
you got to do it because you're cutting

1476
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,280
out years of your life and you you

1477
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:37,280
obviously got a lot of work to do yet I

1478
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,640
know I do do you think about I try all

1479
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,799
the time I just enrolled in another

1480
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,680
eating disorder program it's it's a

1481
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:44,760
constant battle for me well keep at it

1482
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,240
and and think in terms of smaller

1483
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,240
portions and fish and chicken instead of

1484
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:53,440
and forget about this Steaks and Chops

1485
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:56,160
just throw them out and and and no

1486
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,960
butter you know all throw them and there

1487
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,720
were things that are satisfying you know

1488
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,400
sherbets instead of ice cream you know

1489
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,039
and things like that I knew you were

1490
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,920

not kidding and and and I'm I've learned

1507
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:48,559
it by the way accidentally I learned

1508
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,400
that if you cut down a portions because

1509
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,240
I have to cut down a portion because I

1510
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,599
had this osty with it I had something in

1511
01:01:53,240 --> 01:02:00,039
my stomach that was almost did me in

1512
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:03,319
uh it's it I it's very satisfying eating

1513
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:05,640
portions small portions eating it slowly

1514
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:07,920
and have two or three four or five times

1515
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,760
a day but small portions like this

1516
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,039
instead of this maybe we'll do a

1517
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,920
follow-up interview and I'll be in

1518
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,760

1519
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:17,760
next Neil Simon yes yes yes I feel like

1520
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,480
uh there's a magic to to when you save

1521
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:24,200
people right um I wanted to ask you

1522
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,000
about work ethic because even when it

1523
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,039
comes to Twitter you talk about how you

1524
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,559
set aside 10 minutes before you go to

1525
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:32,599
sleep to write tweets yeah so how did

1526
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,000
you develop such a good work ethic I

1527
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:36,680
don't know it's it's just it it's

1528
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,720
pleasurable I these are things that

1529
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:43,359
please me I sit down at the computer I

1530
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,839
look at the email I look at the Twitter

1531
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:49,599
to see if I have to I do a couple

1532
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:52,599
of games of

1533
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,920
solitire and I get to work or in in

1534
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:57,079
rever sometimes reverse I work and then

1535
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,839
do that after but before I go to bed I

1536
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:00,000
always play a couple games of solitire

1537
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:02,960
do you think that's just to keep your

1538
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,520
mind sharp but and I re didn't realize

1539
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,480
it but it does keep your mind sharp

1540
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:09,520
keeps your eyes and mind coordinated you

1541
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,720
have to oh look at that boom boom I love

1542
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,400
when you have move things around before

1543
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,799
I go to bed every night I play this game

1544
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,119
called Rubik's race where you have to

1545
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:19,720
solve a Rubik's Cube very quickly too

1546
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,720
much but it's the same thing it's just

1547
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:24,880
it is that's just something to keep

1548
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:27,039
absolutely but it it's also mind handle

1549
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,520
coordination because you're on a you're

1550
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,079
on a keyboard and you're looking at yeah

1551
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,880
that and I figured out when I play the

1552
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:35,480
game before I go to sleep I have much

1553
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,960
more vivid dreams do you do you get

1554
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,000
strong dreams when you sometimes yeah

1555
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,079
yeah not all not every time and I wish I

1556
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,960
did because I go to a psychas once a

1557
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,520
week and last week I didn't have any

1558
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,240
dream do you do you remember your dreams

1559
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,559
I put them down if I don't you write

1560
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,400
them down yeah if you don't write them

1561
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,960
down you know I forget them I have three

1562
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:57,079
quotes here from my monties and that's

1563
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:59,559
the end of the show okay yeah

1564
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:02,799
do not consider it proof just because it

1565
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:04,839
is written in books for a liar who will

1566
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:08,160
deceive with his tongue will not

1567
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:10,039
hesitate to do the same with his pen so

1568
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,880
he's saying in other words oh yeah well

1569
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:17,279
that's absolutely true and and today

1570
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:19,319
mades would have to say about television

1571
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:22,400
and soon as you read that I'm I'm

1572
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:23,920
reading I'm seeing the Fox network yeah

1573
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,839
they come up with things and they tell

1574
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,680
you they're true and they're not sure

1575
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:29,119
they can they they can present the same

1576
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,799
idea in different mediums and you'll

1577
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,039
believe it more or less based on how you

1578
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:37,000
see it so mes would be very very very

1579
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:38,599
active today if he were on television I

1580
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,160
think if he if he was around now you'd

1581
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:42,079
probably go see him if only for the

1582
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,319
medical he was a doctor as well you know

1583
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,760

01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:49,359
Kylie I'd love to name a kid ROM it's

1585
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,680
it's a good strong name it's giving him

1586
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:56,400
a giving him a big a

1587
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:59,559
responsibility yeah I think uh on on his

on his grave site it said from Moses to

1589
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:06,240

but the story you know is just Sil I'm

1598
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,400
surprised nobody's remade it you can't

1599
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:31,799
not you can never redo it like that oh

1600
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:35,400
my God the

1601
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:39,200
uh it's the it's the most elaborately

1602
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:42,680
structured piece of uh film making ever

1603
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,920
I mean the the sets alone and the uh the

1604
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,200
props I've never seen anything like it

1605
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,200
it's worth looking at What attracted you

1606
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,039
to directing films I wrote a couple of

1607
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,119
films couple films that were directed by

1608
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:56,000
people and I watched the film and I said

1609
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,720
oh why do he do that why did he do that

1610
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,279
why did he why do he go close up on the

1611
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,720
head it's a two shot you want to see the

1612
01:06:01,279 --> 01:06:04,880
guy reacting you don't want to cut to

1613
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,839
the reaction you want the audience to

1614
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,680
look and laugh you cut to the reaction

1615
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:11,000
you're saying laugh they won't laugh if

1616
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,920
you do that right I was I so was

1617
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,039
somebody directed a couple of the first

1618
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:18,200
films I wrote and I said I better direct

1619
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:22,240
so when I wrote the the U screenplay of

1620
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:24,960
a of a book uh ental laughing mhm I

1621
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:28,520
decided I would I would direct it just

1622
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,599
so I would be able to protect protect

1623
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,680
the script that's why I edit the show

1624
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:37,240
myself this show yeah absolutely exactly

1625
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:40,200
right and editing is the I think editing

1626
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,880
is is almost as perform as important if

1627
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,520
not more than the writing or the

1628
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,599
performance you do it in your writing

1629
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:50,400
you edit all the time you're right and

1630
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:53,559
no that editing is the the final polish

1631
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,319
that nobody can I think a bad editor can

1632
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:57,559
destroy a great film there's no such

1633
01:06:55,319 --> 01:07:00,319

you get of an age it's directing a movie

1659
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:04,520
is of two things it's social directing

1660
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:06,400
it's keeping everybody happy on the set

1661
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:09,119
and being

1662
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:13,039
there 12 hours a day and then going into

1663
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:14,680
the editing room no I Tes it I think I

1664
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,239
stopped directing him when I was in my

1665
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,480
80s or something it's too taxing oh it

1666
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:21,839
is taxing I don't think there's any

1667
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,880
90-year old directors you talk about in

1668
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,679
this book all the character actors that

1669
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,640
are forgotten and then you find out that

1670
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:30,279
they died and it makes you happy that

1671
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:33,040
they had a family and yeah well yeah

1672
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:34,920
like for instance little known for I

1673

1677
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:47,719
small parts in a lot of movies and then

1678
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:50,159
at the end you see he had a good life he

1679
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:52,239
had a wife and children with it would

1680
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:54,839

had a star life as a husband and father

1682
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,679
but it doesn't tell tell you in the

1683
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,759

what does it matter it it doesn't matter

1691
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,640
but oh you don't want to go in a

1692
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,199
hospital that's what I would I said

1693
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,000
don't if I have to go to the hospital

1694
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:25,440
give me a so what what what's the trick

1695
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,520
to stay young and keep going is it just

1696
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,920
something you get up for I get up for

1697
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,359
and I say I have my if I didn't have the

1698
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,239
computer to go to I don't know what I

1699
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:38,600
would get up for watch television

1700
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:41,159
Jeopardy is fun you know MH but uh not

1701
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:43,000
enough I was so excited to wake up today

1702
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:44,880
I love days when I when I can't wait to

1703
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,679
wake up just because I got to do this

1704
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,159
today oh that's nice to you this makes

1705
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:51,640
it a a special day it it was marked on

1706
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:53,640
my calendar and well I had two things I

1707
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,480
I did today I got new hearing aids

1708
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,520
wonderful without them I oh that's

1709
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,159
another thing you take your hearing age

1710
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,600
out at night and it's so quiet mhm it's

1711
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:04,120
very quiet well that's good at least you

1712
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,800
get sound sleep men's hearing goes

1713
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,150
earlier than women's for some reason I

1714
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:11,100
don't know why say

1715
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:11,100
[Laughter]

1716
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,679
again at times the truth shines so

1717
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,920
brilliantly that we perceive it as clear

1718
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:21,800
as day our nature and habit then draw a

1719
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:26,159
veil over our perception and we return

1720
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:27,760
to a Darkness almost as dense as before

1721
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,480
what do you make that's people who are

1722
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,960
so involved with themselves that they

1723
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:35,120
can't accept the pleasures that are

1724
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,280
happening to them on the from the

1725
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:41,040
outside like a clear day a beer day yeah

1726
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:44,600
when your when your burdens are

1727
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:46,880
heavy clear day doesn't seem to do much

1728
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,440
except make them seem heavier well that

1729
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,840
goes back to the anxiety what we were

1730
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,960
talking about yeah right how do you

1731
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,679
alleviate the anxiety what what's what

1732
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,960
works best to clear your mind zitan I

1733
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:57,800
don't know

1734
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,679
I don't know well that's one of my

1735
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,719
that's one of my things that I laugh at

1736
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:02,960
so much when they give these new drugs

1737
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:08,080
is do not

1738
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:11,679
take if do not take this drug if you are

1739
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:15,199
prone to sleep eight hours a day eat

1740
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:17,080
food go to the toilet and breathe air

1741
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,400
and drink water when you're thirsty if

1742
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:21,800
you have any of those symptoms this will

1743
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:24,120
kill you right yeah here's here's the

1744
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,880
last quote from my Mones he says You

1745
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,320
must accept the truth

1746
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:31,239
from whatever Source it comes you must

1747
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:33,320
accept the of course why not yeah I

1748
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:35,640
don't think you need to tell me now yeah

1749
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:39,159
sometimes the truth will come from a a

1750
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:41,280
child who doesn't know he's he's come up

1751
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:43,480
with something sometimes they have a

1752
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,280
clearer perception of the world than

1753
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,719
because uh they haven't they haven't

1754
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,880
been fed enough lies yeah or they do you

1755
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:52,080
think that's what it is could be or they

1756
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:55,400
may be forc to taste the water that is

1757
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:58,400
brackish and say this water brackish

1758
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:01,840
I have some lines that I'll I'll close

1759
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,239
on about memories go to plug the books I

1760
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:07,639
remember me and I just remembered and

1761
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:09,480
the new one I I what I what I had

1762
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:11,639
forgotten what I had almost

1763
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:14,159
forgotten here's a few from a bunch of

1764
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:16,639
different philosophers we each need to

1765
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:20,199
make peace with our own memories we have

1766
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:21,920
all done things that make us Flinch and

1767
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:25,360
that's suya

1768
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:29,280
Das memory is a child walking along a SE

1769
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:31,400
sure you never can tell what small

1770
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,239
pebble it will pick up and store away

1771
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,480
amongst its treasured things and that's

1772
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:38,440

1784
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:21,560
yeah Mel was pointing out that I'm all I

1785
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:25,600

1786
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:28,000

1787
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:32,120
in the front of my book I Ed my own I

1788
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,840
quote myself yeah and from a book I the

1789
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:38,000
first my anecdotal life I quoted myself

1790
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,560
from my anecdotal life I wrote it in the

1791
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,880
book and I said I'm looking for a quote

1792
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,239
like this couldn't find one so I used

1793
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,560
Isaiah's a good quote on page 37 so I

1794
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:52,560
quoted myself which nobody's ever

1795
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:55,800
done so but this one now now memory is

1796
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,320
his private jeez that's great and it's

1797
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,120
really true I think we're just a

1798
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,760
compilation of our memories and how we

1799
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:06,719
perceive them anyway you know private

1800
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:13,040
literacy Bible all this a l d us huh

1801
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:15,360
yeah a l d o us o us Huxley

1802
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:17,840
xux you know I did an audition for a

1803
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,239
Comedy Festival and they asked me this

1804
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,199
is a few years ago they didn't get a

1805
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:25,960
sense of who I was from my act in my old

1806
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:27,960
act oh and they said uh well we we

1807
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,360
thought you were very funny but we

1808
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:31,840
didn't really get a sense of who you are

1809
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,000
and I realized now I should have told

1810
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:37,040
them I'm a compilation of all my

1811
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,719
memories and how I perceived

1812
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:43,000
them it's who we all are right that's

1813
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:47,040
what makes you you and me me absolutely

1814
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,840
no question about it and and because you

1815
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:51,960

1816
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,400
