1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,560
but one thing that I have never

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,600
understood is that male comedians will

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,280
get on stage and tell you gross things

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,840
gross things about things they done to

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,639
other people things they do at home

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,520
boogers they pick I don't know the color

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,520
of their poop just weird gross crap

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,279
right the drugs they take the

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,439
unemployment they collect I don't know

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,439
just and after the show inevitably women

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,080
will come up to and go oh my God you are

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,439
so funny hey like what is happening I us

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,759
I would see it all the time it would

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,600
make me really frustrated because a

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,640
woman standing on stage telling jokes

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
gets a look from the men in the audience

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,920
the same look you give babies screaming

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,800
a grocery store like oh I'm not taking

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,000
that home like that's the look you get

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,760
and I'm like I need to turn this around

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,440
for myself I need to Google how to get

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,440
more hits how to drive more traffic how

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,680
to get more clicks or click-throughs or

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,199
so I was reading on the internet I found

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,719
on cosmo. comom that they suggest if you

26
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,680
would like more male attention you

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,079
should consider bedazzling your hooa

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,600

anybody okay they got

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,159

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,280
should be an already hot commodity right

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,439
