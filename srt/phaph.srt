1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,480
here's what my jackass friend did he had

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,480
one of these uh

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,519
children here's what he does he takes

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,200
his kid in for an Autism test I guess

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,719
the kid test negative so he decided to

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,400
post it on Facebook I guess he's happy

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,560
and relieved like hooray my kid tested

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,600
negative for autism I'm like why are you

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,960
happy now you just deal with

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,519
oldfashioned dumb right now now you

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
don't even have an official word to

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,400
apply his behavior people still come to

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
your house like hey what the [ __ ]

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,559
wrong with your kid

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,920
staring at its feet for 17

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,239
hours cuz now you can't say autistic now

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,000
you just got to look at people and go

18
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,160
evidently my sperm is not as much a

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,239
reproductive seed as it is a booya base

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,600
that produces dead-eyed swamp

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,440
creatures this child has been staring

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,440
through a clock for about 12 years

23
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,000
so I know parents hate hearing that and

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,559
I heard them ask earlier whose parents

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,079
so that I I guess that's the resistance

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,320
on this [ __ ] parents hate that you

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,840
realize are you aware of this there're

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,479
actually people who would rather have a

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,840
better life for their children than what

30
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,240
they had for themselves [ __ ] that why

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,000
would you ever do that how about living

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,720
a life so incredible your kid couldn't

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
possibly W up it you know follow that

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,560

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,439

38
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,000

seed whatever you're supposed to feel

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,439
naturally compelled to do that I have no

46
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,680
desire to do I've decided I'm ending my

47
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,320
family and I tell them I tell them I'm

25th do anyone like understand how

94
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
significant that date is it's an

95
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,080
important dat June 25th six months a day

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,200
after Jesus Christ's birthday huh that

97
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,519

means I assume he does the first half of

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,280
the year and I do the last half I don't

100
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,680
know what it means I am determined to

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,519
prove I'm special that's what all this

102
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,560
means that's what a child psychologist

103
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,920
told my mom Paul thinks he's special and

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,120
he really really needs to see his father

105
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,879

106
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,519
Ghost
