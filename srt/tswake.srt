2
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,439

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,199
pretty much did it all myself right down

4
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,359

looks a lot older than it actually is

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,640

couldn't color correct in post and uh

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,399
the white balance was brought was out of

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,920
the sync on both cameras so uh what

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,879
happened was we just had to take the

system

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,840

73
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,919
way Catholics have been breeding

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,470
Purgatory is going to be terrible

75
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:41,009

behavior I I I have no respect for

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,360
authority I don't that's that's why I

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,800
can relate to Rodney King you

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,680
know yeah I I really feel sorry for

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,680
Rodney King you've got

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,840
to just a poor innocent crack

83
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,479
addict driving 100 m an hour drunk

84
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,080
through a school

85
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,530
zone oh next thing you know trouble with

86
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,759
the

87
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,800
[Laughter]

88
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,600
law and what I don't understand and the

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,400
police were really basing their defense

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
on this was that in their eyes he was

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,479
not acting subdued they felt that he

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,600
kept trying to get up and I don't

93
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,639
understand that when you get hit with a

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,639
night stick you're supposed to play de

95
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
that saved my life on a number of

96
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,000
occasions oh in my rambunctious youth I

97
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,360
knew all too well the distinctive sting

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,639
a night stick leaves and I'd lay real

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,639
still no one ever had a riot for

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,520
me of course everyone says well that

101
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,560
whole Rodney King think now that that

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,560
was just racism and I think no that was

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,600
just CS

104
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,479
we hire people that like to do that kind

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,039
of

106
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,120
stuff see I once felt that it was my

107
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,000
duty to give a comp a little lesson in

108
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,000
constitutional

109
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,199
law oh he was so grateful he returned

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,520
the favor by giving me a little lesson

111
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,520
on how the system really

112
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,759
worked actually I felt I was exercising

113
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,160
My First Amendment right to free speech

114
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,759

118
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,800
was I laid real

119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,680
still not that I'm saying that that

120
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,880
prejudice does not exist it's

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,720
rampant every single one of us in this

122
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,639
room here tonight is prejudiced in one

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,319
form or another it's just that some

124
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,680
forms of prejudice we recognize as bad

125
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,919
and there's some that we completely

126
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,520
ignore for instance when I came up here

127
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,199
on stage just about 25 minutes ago you

looking for a call to the motor

135
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,560

are there's racis and we recognize as

139
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,840
bad there's racism we completely

140
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,360
ignore when a black kid gets beat up in

141
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,479
an all-white neighborhood that's

142
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,319
racism when a white kid gets beat up in

143

an all black neighborhood that's

144
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,160

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,079
shopping a Scotsman are

191
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,279
cheap that's funny cuz they're

192
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,680
Scotsman you'll never see a chain of

193
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,680
stores called The Frugal

194
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,370
[Applause]

195
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,600
Jew the same thing isn't

196
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,079
[Music]

197
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,730
it well except for the fact that Jews

198
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:31,399
probably own the Thrifty Scots

199
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:33,079
[Applause]

200
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,680
a lot of people use AIDS as a way to

201
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,760
Prejudice themselves against groups they

202
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,040
never cared for much in the first place

203
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,399
and they think that's all right because

204
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,760
it's just good health sense

205
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,920
and God actually uses aids to punish

206
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,920
Sinners you know people believe that in

207
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,600
1993 they believe that just kind of the

208
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,320
way that they used to feel about leprosy

209
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,720
in the time of Christ you the Catholics

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,519
figure that aids is God's way of

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,959
punishing promiscuity and the

212
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,000
Protestants figure it's God's way of

213
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,040
punish ing substance abuse and I guess

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,800
the Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian

215
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,680
Scientists figure it's God's way of

216
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,680
punishing blood

217
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,680
transfusions I don't think God really

218
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,240
works that way punishing with

219
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,680
disease if he did wouldn't there be some

220
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,240
form of incurable attorney virus

221
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,279
[Applause]

222
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,519
we don't know how it's spread but it

223
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,760
seems to only strike injury attorneys

224
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,760
and

225
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,320

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,720
law forget that we've already got laws

245
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,680
against armed robbery Grand Theft Auto

246
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,839
abduction kidnapping now we got a

247
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,639
specific law so when some young punk

248
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,160
takes a gun and holds it up to a car

249
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,360
window he's going to go oh wait a

250
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,680
minute oh they just passed that law

251
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,680
didn't

252
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,320

this handgun registered

259
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,680
too see I don't think the solution to

260
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,639
carjacking is more laws I think the

261
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,800
solution to carjacking is something very

262
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,959
simple we've had it for a very long time

263
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,760
it's called

264
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,959
holsters mounted permanently into car

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,560
doors right about crotch

266
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,880
level say you can tuck a pistol in there

267
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,800
and you wouldn't even want to put a hole

268
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,360
in the car door either that way some

269
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,360
young punk won't know if there's a

270
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,560
pistol in that holer or not and if there

271
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,500
is there'll just be a little extra

272
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,590

274
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,480
wound and you know you wouldn't even

275
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,759
have to use you wouldn't even have to

276
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,160
use a trigger you could hook up a

277
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,480
hydraulic release mechanism and put a

278
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,639
switch on the

279
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,560
floorboards like where that dimer switch

280
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,560
used to be in the older

281
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,360
models you wouldn't have to take your

282
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,920
hands off the

283
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,240

288
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,519
tempting to use this thing

289
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,079
like when you were stuck in

290
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,600
traffic and had those impatient jerks

291
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,560
passing you on the left and cutting in

292
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,480
front of

you of course they'd only do it

294
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,759
once amazing what a little Gunplay will

295
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,759
do to increase driver

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,399
etiquette see I I I don't believe in gun

297
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,560
control I I think it's

298
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,199
wrong I I I don't see how we really

299
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,079
think that we can get rid of all the

300
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,440
firearms in America you know I'll just

301
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:01,920
make them illegal and we'll get rid of

302
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,600
them just like we got rid of all the

303
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,600
drugs in

304
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,720
America see I think we have the right to

305
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,680
own oozies if we want

306
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,920

308
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,370
fire 60 shots in 10 seconds maybe

309
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,419

sport which is very funny but it's

312
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,759
ignoring the real issue you see the

313
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,680
right to bear arms is not the right to

314
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,399
hunt

315
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,440

316
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,360
worried about having the right to hunt

317
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,480
taken away from them the right to bear

318
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,959
arms is the right to arm one's

319
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,920
population in the event an unjust

320
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,920
government has to be

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,120
overthrown right now the right to bear

322
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,880
arms is the only form of term limitation

323
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,880
we have in the Constitution

324
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,959
that's why we need

325
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,920
ues cuz you got to know without a doubt

326
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,720
in your mind if you're going to take out

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,080
parents that's hard enough as it is but

377
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,880
it just really ticks me off Bill's

378
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,159
attitude about sending her to private

379
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,280
school it's like well yeah but there's

380
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,960
nothing wrong with the public school

381
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,960
system yeah for you

382
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,320
people I guess it was kind of a personal

383
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,799
issue though it seems that the students

384
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,720
at the DC Middle School had the Secret

385
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,720
Service out gone

386
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,240
yeah nothing more tax dollars won't

387
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,600
cure see all you really doing when when

388
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,000
you're taxing the wealthiest uh 1% of

389
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,480
America at a higher rate than the rest

390
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,600
of us all you're really doing is you

391
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,880
leave the remaining 99% that thinks it's

392
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,840
a good idea and will still vote for you

393
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,200
it's not really a solution it's just

394
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,760
playing the odds if Mexico were a state

395
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,720
we'd all be

396
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,720
screwed we'd all be in the wealthiest 1%

397
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,120
then I think everybody in this room

398
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,120
makes more than a 100 bucks a

399
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,360
year see that's what we forget on a

400
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,440
global scale we are the

401
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,559
rich We're a nation we're no child born

402
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,760

403
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,080

404
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,080
amazing

405
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:12,280
thing there's nobody starving in

406
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,280
America if it was wouldn't it be in the

407
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,120
papers the last person I remember

408
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,200
reading about starving to death in

409
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,200
America was Karen

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Carpenter that was n years ago and

411
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,640
self-induced

412
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,720
don't get me wrong I know there there's

413
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,240
people

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,799
hungry there's people eating stuff

415
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,120
they'd rather not be

416
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,360
eating there's no one

417
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,210
starving we have fat homeless

418
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,210
[Music]

419
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,159
people our Farmers grow so much food we

420
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
have to pay them off with tax dollars

421
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,240
not to grow

422
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,280
anymore because we even waste so much

423
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,080
food at restaurants you can get a hot

424
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,080
meal out of a

425
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,039
dumpster some of you are looking at me

426
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,039
like I know that a little too

427
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,039
well I was in Washington DC a couple

428
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,039
weeks back uh looking for the

429
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,000
change you and it looks exactly like it

430
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,039
did during the Reagan Bush years a lot

431
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
of homeless people and a lot of

432
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,960
limousines

433
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,279
didn't see any change but I actually was

434
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,520
watching something that really changed

435
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,039
my perspective I I saw a homeless man

436
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,480
feeding stale breadcrumbs to the birds

437
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,000
they they were a little bit too stale

438
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,760
for his

439
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,360
liking I'm watching this and I'm going

440
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,520
man there's nobody starving in

441
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,159
America if there was you would not see a

442
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:59,039
homeless man feeding bread to the

443
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,039
birds you wouldn't see birds

444
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,760
in Somalia there's no such thing as a

445
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,760
stray

446
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,279
animal I doubt there's too many pets

447
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,520
left I don't really why do we want to

448
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,480
think we're more miserable than we are

449
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,880
that's why people in Haiti are dying to

450
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,799
get into this country they they can't

451
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,760
believe this well they're willing to

452
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,039
risk 600 miles of open shark infested

453
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,600
ocean to get here and Bill goes oh I

454
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,600
didn't say

455
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,039
no they can't believe this country

456
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,040
they're like you mean in America you got

457
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,559
Parks just full of

458
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,520
[Laughter]

459
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:50,080
pigeons and they're so Ted that they'll

460
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,760
eat right out of your hand like even if

461
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:59,240
you got a great big stick in the other

462
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,240
one it's pouy every night in America

463
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,279
if we're not going to let the Haitians

464
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,460
into this country we should turn the

465
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,440
Statue of Liberty

466
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,880

Vacancy sign in a

motel you got to get rid of that plaque

471

480
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,919
more truthful like send us your wealthy

481
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,320
you're white you're

482
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,760
educated you're foreign doctors who

483
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,960
can't speak a word of

484
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:59,159
English love to feed the rest of you but

485
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,159
the breast of Liberty are only so large

486
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,720
[Applause]

487
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,919
anyway Bill's going to change the

488
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,360
Student Loan program around

489
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,080
too yeah he's going to offer a volunteer

490
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,799
service to pay off your student

491
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,159
loan now that doesn't seem right to me

492
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,919
it's kind of backwards you get the

493
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,640
student loan you go to school then you

494
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,720
do volunteer service that's kind of like

495
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,510
saying well here's your paycheck when

496
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,360
you get it spent you report for work

497
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:34,159
[Laughter]

498
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,679
no not only that you're going to be able

499
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,200
to borrow as much money as you want now

500
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,919
he's going to remove all limits from the

501
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,960
amount of money you can borrow and

502
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,480
rather than borrow the money from Banks

503
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,880
because Banks don't know anything about

504
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,120
loaning money you'll now be able to

505
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,120
borrow directly from the

506
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,919
government apparently Bill isn't aware

507
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,799
of the student loan default rate as it

508
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:02,039
stands I found it quite easy to flunk

509
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:04,559
out a with $2,000 worth of

510
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,170
liquor H if there was no limit I'd be

511
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,919

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,480
ridiculous marijuana legislation off the

566
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,480
books for good here is positive proof

567
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,480
that marijuana is indeed

568
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:49,240

569
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,159

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,960
asylum somewhere did he become a burnout

648
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,799
free

649
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,639
country remember that when you a little

650
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,679

651
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:03,559

653
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,600

654
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,639
little kid in China would in that same

655
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,480
situation oh I don't have to go home

656
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,480
it's a totalitarian socialist

657
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,440
systems you don't even own your own

658
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,360
house it's the people's house

659
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,720
that's what scares me the most about

660
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,519
this War on Drugs we're just handing

661
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,880
over our freedoms and no one seems to

662
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,480
care the Fourth Amendment the

663
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,279
Constitution says quite plainly that

664
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,320
there should be no form of governmental

665
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,320
search or seizure but now well we think

666
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,320
it's perfectly acceptable just to seize

667
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,799
all the property any even suspect has

668
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,279
been using drugs forget due process

669
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,440
we're not letting the government search

670
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,840
without warrants inside of our homes our

671
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,260
cars even our bodily fluids just to keep

672
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,880
our neighbors away from Fred and

standards you know you see people saying

696
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,720
well we should outlaw alcohol we tried

697
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,850
that once we know it doesn't work

698
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,079
especially in the Chicago

699
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,839

700
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,000

weapons long before

702
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,480

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,720
driveby shooting was invented right here

704
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,720
in Chicago in the 20s

705
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,800

706
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,200

707
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,200

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,720
yeah had he been smoking marijuana he

710
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,919
would have gone through the same three

711
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,280
stops but he would have only been going

712
00:34:47,919 --> 00:35:04,049
2 miles an hour

713
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:04,049

Prejudice I think it's just prejudice

716
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,160
against substance

717
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,599
preferred we send our pothe heads to

718
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,390
jail while we send our alcoholics into

719
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,560
the House and Senate

720
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,560

723
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:41,119
substance it we do alcohol is just a

724
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,560
drug I think we all know

749
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:50,520

pregnant women should not consume this

753
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,839
product hold it

day with the worm while you're pregnant

757
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,440
you've got no right reproducing in the

758
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,760
first

759
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,520
place aren't our trailer park

760
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,520
overcrowded

761
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:24,480
[Applause]

762
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,760
enough yeah sure I can get away with

763
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,760
that in Chicago

764
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,119
but don't boo me I didn't say where I

765
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,079
couldn't

766
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,800
anyway yeah I think I think it's stupid

767
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,119
that that the amount of jail space were

768
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,480
taken up with with drug

769
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,000
criminals right now more than 50% of all

770
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,520
prison capacity is occupied by drug

771
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,520
violations alone think about that we

772
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,000
could double the prison beds just by

773
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,720
calling an into this war that we're

774
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,880
losing

775
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,280
miserably we are send we are um letting

776
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,119
murderers and rapists out of jail early

777
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,160
so we can lock up the people who have a

778
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,160
Yabba Duba do

779
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,319
time here's how this works against us

780
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,319
Jeffrey

781
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,000
dmer well we had him once before all the

782
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,280
nonsense

783
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,520
started but because of overcrowding he

784
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:33,359
was let go after only 12 months of work

785
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,640
release for molesting a child 12 months

786
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,720
that should have been the death penalty

787
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,720
right there I

788
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,319
figure it would have freed up a lot of

789
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,319
newspaper

790
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,640
space meanwhile if you get caught with a

791
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,400
pound and a half of cocaine in Michigan

792
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,400
which is not that much

793
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,400
[Laughter]

794
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,480
this just a good party backstage Guns

795
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,480
and

796
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,480
Roses I might add an awful lot of you

797
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,119
seem to know exactly how much a pound in

798
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,000
a half of cocaine

799
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:23,200
is how much is compared to a molested

800
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,119
child a pound and a half of cocaine in

801
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,400
Michigan will now get you life

802
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,560
imprisonment it used to be mandatory the

803
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,359
state supreme court said that's a little

804
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,319
strict but right now the legislature is

805
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:36,640
frantically trying to get it reinstated

806
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:38,800
mandatory life no parole ever turn now

807
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,400
you can be paroled in Michigan for

808
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,400
murder or rape after 6 years so I guess

809
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,920
that's what we learn here if you get

810
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,600
caught with a lot of cocaine in Michigan

811
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:55,520
you better rape and kill that

812
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:58,000
[Applause]

813
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,880
cop you want to get off and entirely you

814
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,880
eat him and plead

815
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,119
Insanity I'm not

816
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,920
serious I'm finding out the hypocrisy of

817
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,480
the judicial system how do I see any on

818
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,480
the side of the road after the show

819
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:26,760
[Applause]

820
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,760
going well the comic told me to

821
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,839
see I I I I think I actually think we'd

822
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,400
be a lot better off in this country Ju

823
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:41,839
Ju Just legalizing the stuff taxing it

824
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,599
and put the farmers back to

825
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:49,119
work no subsidies

826
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:49,119
necessary encourage Americans to buy

827
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,200
American that's true maybe take some of

828
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
this money that that that we're not

829
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,359
spending on this war we're losing

830
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,520
miserably and and maybe pay back a

831
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,480
little of the national

832
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,839
debt which if the Clinton economic plan

833
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,280
goes as planned will be another trillion

834
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,480
dollars higher in

835
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,680
1996 it took 204 years to get the

836
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,000
national debt up to 1 trillion it took

837
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,640
12 years of bush and Reagan to get it up

838
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,200
to four trillion now Clinton's getting

839
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,359
it to five in only four years that's the

840
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:28,720
kind of deficit reduction we need I

841
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,359
