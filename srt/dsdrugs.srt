to be such a bad alcoholic that even

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,000
alcoholics they named a bar after

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,360
because you just hover around it like

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,399

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:54,480

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,959
to an AMC movie theater where you use

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,360
to commit to this because I um I am not

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,599
a political comedian I'm terrible at it

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,799

80
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,200
wish I have friends they're so good

81
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,280
comedians they they're such clever uh

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
writers and they can examine an issue

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,319
and turn it over until they find the

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,080
unexplored corner of that issue and then

85
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,040
they drill down and extract a

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,720
well-written uh sharp concise succinct

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
joke that channels our feelings of Rage

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,319
or or Injustice and they're so good at

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,040
that I don't have that I just go from

90
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,120
zero to [ __ ] this that's all I have and

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,439

00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:12,079
and a half years I I always ask for

94
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,799
consent before I do it uh so if it's

95
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,720

96
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,199
