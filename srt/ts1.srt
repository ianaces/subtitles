00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,240
[Applause]

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,679
this uh this seems like a good City to

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
have a nice healthy beard in so I grew

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,160
it out just for

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,850
you you know what I'm talking about

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,320
don't you

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,800
[Laughter]

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,800
beardo it takes a real man to grow a

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
beard

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,079
I like saying it like that because I

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,760
feel like the bigger your beard gets the

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,320
higher your voice should go because the

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,160
testosterone in your body has been

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,440
diverted to the beard

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,280
cause so like the bigger your beard get

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,280

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,440

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,360
people who cannot grow facial hair and

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,360

cleaning a gun
