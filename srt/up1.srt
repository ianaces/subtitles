don't have

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,000
children yeah but the other 364 days

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,840

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,599

the biggest word I know anti- anti-

228
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,440
disestablishmentarianism I think is the

229
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,760
longest word in the dictionary I thought

230
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,760
thought it was pneuma ultra microscopic

231
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,000
silico volcanic coniosis that would be a

232
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,880
medical term I'm talking the Webster's

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,600
Dictionary Miram Webster what's the

234
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,279
difference between count

235
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,120
Scrabble what why why is it a medical

236
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,200
term a word it's not that it's not it's

237
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,680
just not necessar a word it's more a

238
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,600
medical term this a subtle distinction

239
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,279
so I'm right no I'm

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
right correct guys I'm going to level

241
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,560
with you I'm not actually [ __ ] Steve

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,240
I just made it up for the joke uh I did

243
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,200
actually go on a real date recently so

244
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,600
and by that I mean I met a woman from

245
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Tinder at a sports bar in

246
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,279
Roseville and we made out in the parking

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,120
lot cuz we're both

248
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,560
14 I'm kidding only she was 14 that's

249
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,000
not

250
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,760
funny what's the deal with consent laws

251
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,920
am I right no uh no but she was like 23

252
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,320
or something it's not really important

253
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,560
to the story but the point is we made

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,519
out it was a good date by all accounts

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,880
we made plans to hang out a couple days

256
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,320
later couple days later I text her hey

257
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,680
how's it going and she responded pretty

258
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,680
good funny story I got back together

259
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,760
with my ex today and I was like well

260
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,600
that wasn't funny or a

261
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,880
story you set that up so

262
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,920
wrong I think she should have said uh

263
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,279
pretty good relevant

264
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,839
anecdote won't be making out of Buffalo

265
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,839
Wild Wings

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,920
anymore I've been married for 18 years

267
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,320
myself so um yeah I know amazing I was

268
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,560
married at 12

269
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,000
um yeah it's been it's not the most

270
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,040
passionate relationship anymore I'd have

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,959
to say um this year we bought each other

272
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,440
um a sectional couch for our anniversary

273
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,560
and it was like the biggest couch that

274
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,480
they had to offer and then the year

275
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,880
before that we bought a king-size bed so

276
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,519

buying furniture that's so big that we

278
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,160
don't have to physically be near each

279
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,160
other when we use it so it's working out

280
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,399

365
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,000
is really that is rare and hard to

366
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,880
identify so the lady that hired me she

367
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,279
said uh you're going to go up do a half

368
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,800
hour of comedy please keep it clean I

369
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,959
said okay that's fine she said before

370
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,759
you go up we're going to do a couple of

371
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,720
presentations I said great that's that's

372
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,199
cool I'm waiting backstage first

373
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,000
presentation was a woman who had a rare

374
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:16,160
disease it was that caused macular

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,560
degeneration she went blind and she

376
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,680
became a

377
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,959
photographer over the course of her

378
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,560
illness to overcome it was beautiful

379
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,320
don't laugh at that it's genuine that's

380
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,480
not that's this is the setup part of the

381
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,880
joke where you're not supposed to

382
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,759
laugh but no it was beautiful all of her

383
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,360
shots looked great they were in Focus

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,759
everything was nice and it was uplifting

385
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,000
and then they had another presentation

386
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,920
and it was a girl with a bone disease

387
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,519
and she became a [ __ ]

388
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,440
ballerina that's not a joke she did she

389
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,000

and perform for everybody and then they

393
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,639

white dude doing this awesome voice

515
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,360
could be construed as

516
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,919
racist and I I want to ask a black

517
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,679

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,600
asking a black person if this voice is

519
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,320
okay while doing this voice would

520
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,760
definitely be

521
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,000
racist and also because uh there's one

522
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,600
