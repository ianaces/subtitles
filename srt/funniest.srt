the contest

2
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,000
is not

3
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,719
important it is too many Comics think

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,640
that their self-worth as a human

5
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,920
being is wrapped up in the

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,160
contest that's not true at all has

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,039
nothing to do with the contest the

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,640
contest is not important and it doesn't

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:57,520
matter however the contest is very

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
important and it matters quite a bit

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,960

16
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,759
favorite thing about riding my bicycle

17
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,159

186
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,040

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:46,600

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,600
crazy or you crazy than the [ __ ]

189
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,240
like we don't even need to bring WebMD

190
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,720
into

191
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,880
this my background is very different

192
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,959
from a lot of comics you know a lot of

193
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,560
these people grew up with like houses

194
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,959
where people didn't get shot on a

195
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,360
regular basis you know or they grew up

196
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,160
in the suburbs and that's foreign to me

197
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,880
you know I like to hear about them and

198
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,160
they dog and soccer games when they was

199
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,480
a kid I don't know nothing about that

200
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,480
being a part of the Austin comedy scene

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,040
I was very reluctant for a while I was

202
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,680
like I have nothing in common with these

203
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,279
people I would not drink with none of

204
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,480
these people I wouldn't even do drugs

205
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,279
with none of these people however I have

206
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,240
grown to love these people and I have a

207
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,120
lot of respect and I feel like I bring

208
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,480
something a little little different um I

209
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,560
bring my Detroit flavor I bring my

210
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,920
street knowledge to the game you know

211
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,639
all that stuff cuz I want to be famous

212
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,519
not really because I want to be rich I

213
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,200
just want some better food to

214
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,560
eat like my idea of making it is to be

215
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,079
able to drive down I35 with a plate of

216
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,440
steaks in the passenger seat just biting

217
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,560

240
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:15,160

243
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,519
when I started doing comedy I already

244
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,600
had a bunch of [ __ ] going on in my life

245
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,279
I responsibilities I mean you I was

246
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,160
married had a full

247
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,800
job um you know a wife who was sitting

248
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,399
at home alone while I'm wanting to go

249
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,199
out gallivanting around getting drunk

250
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,760
with my friends telling jokes on stage

251
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,959
uh the only way to get better at standup

252
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,959
comedy is to do it and the only way to

253
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,560
do it is to go out in the evenings and

254
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,639
go to Rooms where they have stand up

255
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,880
comedy and get on that stage and and

256
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,199
tell jokes to people it's fine when

257
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,440
you're young and you can take that risk

258
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,760
on your own it's a little bit different

259
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,399
when you're asking a wife who had no

260
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,199
idea that you wanted to be a comedian

261
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,839
when she married you and all of a sudden

262
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:09,880
is trying to be supportive for this new

263
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,639
hobby that you found that it's costing

264
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,560
an increasing amount of money and taking

265
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,240
you away from her a whole lot um that

266
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,880
can be that it can be stressful so I got

267
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,880
one for you Norm okay okay here we go

268
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,160

him the Austin Chronicles set of Norm he

275

part-time

277
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,279

better job especially for his

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,440

time I was doing like a lot of writing

303
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,040
it just kind of LED to stand up that was

304
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,079
the easiest thing to do it's like you

305
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,680
can just get up on stage I moved to

306
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,600
Austin because I was very unhappy in

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,600
Pittsburgh which is the the way the

308
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,320
scene was and the the the quality of the

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,600
large I was kind of out to a small group

346
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,560
of people um I was talking to another

347
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,519
comic in town and he said both the

348
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,040
simultaneously most awful and and

349
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,600
coolest thing anybody had said to me

350
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,199
he's like this is going to be great for

351
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,199
your comedy career and it's true I feel

352
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,519
guilty but it's true like all of a

353
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,079
sudden I'm a something you know like

354
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,600
when you book me or when you put me on

355
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,160
stage you know okay we're going to have

356
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,839
a trans comic you know and I feel like I

357
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,600
know enough about what I'm doing that

358
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm more than that like I'm also funny

359
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,640
maybe sometimes but at least the hook is

360
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,400
something that I can bring to the table

361
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,120
that I couldn't as just another dude

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,200
like this even though I'm

367
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,000
17 I'm joking the parenting is not that

368
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,240
hard I mean some of you parents out here

371
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,640
night we did it we got out of the

372
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,520
house this will be my fourth time doing

373
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,159
the contest and my first time as a woman

374
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,120
it feels like my rookie

375
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,280
year yes it does now I have a new

376
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,360
dilemma um how many jokes do I do about

377
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,520
being trans do I do five minutes or six

378
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,320
minutes of that do I do one opener to

379
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,960
break the ice and then jump into other

380
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,919
stuff can I even write any other stuff

381
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,440
anymore I'm not sure I haven't been able

382
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,840
to so far part of me just wants to go

383
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,039
for it and just talk about being trans

384
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,120
the whole time because let's face it

385
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,919
it's interesting and that gets me

386
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,200
halfway there to being funny the comics

387
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,080
that change me when I watch them On

388
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Stage are the people that are being so

389
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,440
wholly the elves and human that you go

390
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,240
oh I've had that moment before oh I get

391
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
that I love having all the jokes and the

392
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,200
weird stories in between but I love

393
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,919
those you know even in an hour set just

394
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,280
two or three moments where you go well

395
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,720
that was really real and I get that

396
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,600
thank you very

397
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,159
much my name is Danny I grew up in

398
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,360
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania which that is

399
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,400
the appropriate

400
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,640
response let's all have a moment of

401
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,200
silence for that dying

402
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,799
Town Pittsburgh where pollution is a

403
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
part of our Rich

404
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,400
history people there aren't screwing

405
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,480
around and people there will litter and

406
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,480
make eye contact with

407
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,159
you what do you think about that [ __ ]

408
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,840
huh yeah it wasn't great I did not have

409
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,320
fun doing the contest last year or the

410
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,200
year before I think this is the year I

411
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,360
start having fun doing it though because

412
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,919
I just don't give a [ __ ] go into it with

413
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,200
zero expectations that's the best way to

414
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,360
go into it if you think you go in I

415
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,760
don't know any comic who goes in

416
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,200
thinking they're going to win it's it's

417
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,679
like everyone else thinks like oh it's

418
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,559
so- and so's year or it's so and so's

419
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,559
year I don't think any comic has ever

420
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,280
thought this is my year I had dropped

421
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,919
out of college to do comedy and and I

422
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,960
had you know made all these big life

423
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,120
choices and doing making the finals was

424
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,720
like my the my way of saying like look

425
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,840
I'm doing the right thing or I must have

426
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,520
made the right choice if I made the

427
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,880
finals but man we've had some stinkers

428
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,200
in the finals too there's been some

429
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,559
terrible Comics we've made the finals

430
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,320
and like what is happened like who's

431
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,320
judging this

432
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,760
stuff I try to explain like like

433
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,080
like I I use what I call the car analogy

434
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,120
I don't if you're familiar with this

435
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,200
right like like say you've got this car

436
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,679
you've had this car forever but you love

437
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,919
this car I mean it's a it's a

438
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,720
comfortable car it's a reliable car and

439
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,840
yeah it's a sexy car right you could

440
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,039
never

441
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,799
imagine not being

442
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,159
satisfied with just this one car that

443
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,679
doesn't mean you don't want to

444
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,400
occasionally

445
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,400
you know go out and [ __ ] other

446
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,120
[Applause]

447
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,720
women I think I had a better set than at

448
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,000
least one of the people who advance that

449
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,880
night the judges are bad people let's be

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,720
very clear on this people who purport to

451
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,600
be able to judge

452
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,840
comedy bad people four to five judges

453
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,039
every preliminary round we just start in

454
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,880
February just start you know rounding up

455
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,720
the people that we know enjoy it and

456
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,000
that are good good and are unbiased

457
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,240
that's why the prelims are so tough

458
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,400
because the judges don't know a lot

459
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,520
about comedy they

460
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,679
have uh they their senses of humor

461
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,640
aren't the kind of sense of humor that

462
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,320
drives the scene and they see something

463
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,840
they don't like even though it's funny

464
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,640
it's it might not Advance because they

465
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,640
didn't like it well that P that comic

466
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,120
worked a little dirty why the [ __ ] are

467
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,480
you judging I have worked all of them

468
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,520
every one every single one for the last

469
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,320
20 years like people are excited to come

470
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,720
in for the to judge the semi-finals and

471
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,279
the finals The Comedy Central and Talon

472
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,400
Agents from Los Angeles and San

473
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:39,440
Francisco it's just it's a big deal it's

474
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,400
uh potentially life-changing for not

475
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,960
just the winner but for all of the

476
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,880
finalists got me uh Comedy Central you

477
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,919
know like cuz I got in front of people

478
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,559
from Comedy Central they got me uh Last

479
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,559
Comic Standing it helped in many

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
ways got stuck taking my niece to the

481
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,559
park we weren't even there for 5 minutes

482
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,960
and she was already whining about being

483
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,159
always a duck and never a goose I told

484
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,240
her it's that kind of bitching that's

485
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,240
going to make you always a

486
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,600
bridesmaid so like he obviously really

487
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,799
deserved to win this the competition so

488
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,559
there are some people that I saw this

489
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,520
year in the three nights of prel

490
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,240
preliminaries that I did who I'm like

491
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,559
they could win it's exciting I don't

492
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,640
know they showcase Talent uh they bring

493
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,880
new people that like cap City's probably

494
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,360
never seen before and all sudden they're

495
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,120
like wow that person's phenomenal it's a

496
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,919
really cool thing for Cap City to have

497
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,120
and it's brings in people like me

498
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,520
getting to watch new comedians I've

499
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,080
never seen so yeah in no way would I say

500
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,080
anything negative about a competition

501
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,760
last year for for the contest my odds

502
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,840
are pretty good I got in third place out

503
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,559
of 200 Comics so this year you know I

504
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,320
would like to hopefully win I mean but

505
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm not going to hold my breath it's

506
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,279
been 30 years and ain't nobody black won

507
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,799
so and it's been what 12 since a woman

508
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,559
won so it's been a minute you know I I

509
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,960
could hope but I'm I'm cautiously

510
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,720
optimistic but that's just how it is

511
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,000
like it's hard to say that that's just

512
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,120
how it is um and we shouldn't accept

513
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,279
that but I do feel that it's a high time

514
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,440
that a woman wins and not like it's our

515
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:23,240
time we deserve it

516
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,960
but a many women have deserved it you're

517
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,240
the last woman that's won the contest

518
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,880
why do you

519
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,360
think it's it's been almost 15 years

520
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,760
since another woman has won do you think

521
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,039
it's just chance for a long time there

522
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,080
weren't a lot of women Comics here I

523
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,880
think that it's only been the past maybe

524
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:46,000
like three or four years where there's

525
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,279
has have been more women Comics here who

526
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,080
who are also funny like it hasn't just

527
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:54,480
been an increase in numbers like it's

528
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,799
also those women are really funny

529
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,039
there's a lot of funny people in this

530
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,440
town to try and be the funniest person

531
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:02,679
in this town officially with the stats

532
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,480
and documented it's a special thing so I

533
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,919
I it's I'm embracing it more and more I

534
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
think the contest is a good stepping

535
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,880
stone because it's very rare that in

536
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,480
like your first year doing comedy you

537
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,600
get to like open at a comedy club like

538
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,840
you wouldn't get to do that if I had

539
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,799
started in I wouldn't get to do that if

540
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,279
I started in like LA or New York it was

541
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,039
the most fun show I'd ever done like I'd

542
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:23,480
never performed for that many people and

543
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,559
the crowds were awesome and I felt like

544
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,080
I got to see all the comics do great and

545
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,399
it made me really glad I'd move here it

546
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,279
was really fun

547
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:37,600
adrenaline just the the that first night

548
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,320
you want to make it to the next round

549
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,279
and then round after round you want to

550
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,919
keep going so it's like you want to

551
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,240
change your material but you don't want

552
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,720
to you know and no matter what you do

553
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,919
during the day the only thing you're

554
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:55,799
thinking about is that night all week

555
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,799
like oh man I can't 7:30 here it

556
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,600
is it's kind of the worst thing that

557
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,399
could possibly happen for me happened

558
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:10,000
which is that I'm on the first night

559
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:11,200
April 6th and today is April 1 so um

560
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,960
every other year I've done this I've

561
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,399
been somewhere in the middle and there

562
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,080
were 14 nights this year so like the

563
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:19,480
odds of drawing the first night were

564
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,799
really low and I was just sort of

565
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,120
counting on having a week or two to pull

566
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:27,279
my set together at some open mics and

567
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,960
now I've got five days four of which are

568
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,600
booked up with things that are not

569
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,080
working on Comedy part of me just wants

570
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,799
to write this year off now like um I'm

571
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,679
going to get up there I'm going to

572
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,840
perform um as a woman for the first time

573
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,360
and that'll be

574
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,679
fun

575
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,159
but as far as like getting somewhere in

576
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,960
the contest the likelihood of me getting

577
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,679
through to the semifinals and there's

578
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,919
some good people on my night too um I'm

579
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,120
not going to get I'm not going to name

580
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,840
names because that's a good way to sound

581
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,840
stupid later but uh yeah there's some

582
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,760
good people on my night

583
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,240
I I just think uh I I want to write it

584
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,919
off I don't want to be that negative but

585
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,480
just my expectations are definitely

586
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,120
lower now that I know I'm going to go

587
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:12,200
right away and I don't feel prepared so

588
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,200
that's where my head is

589
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:21,159
[Music]

590
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,440
at you ever spit a lugie in your hair

591
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,480
I've done that before I don't think you

592
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,159
want to get it cut off half remember

593
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,240
somebody telling me to like Pat it on

594
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,840
instead of rubbing it on so I just slap

595
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,120
the [ __ ] out of myself when I'm putting

596
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,399
makeup on I don't know if that's what

597
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,640
you're supposed to do or if I'm just

598
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,440
like punishing myself I have to wear

599
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,480
this stuff that makes my skin look green

600
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,840
because it's the only thing strong

601
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,679
enough to cover up my stubble it's

602
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,080
actually tattoo cover up like if you

603
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,799
work at Denny's but you got that face

604
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,200
tattoo in prison this is like how you'd

605
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,120
get rid of

606
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,880
it we're in ausome Texas by 183 in

607
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:00,880
Anderson Square not enough food trucks

608
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
y'all until some

609
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,600
comedy you think you wouldn't be nervous

610
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,320
by your fourth

611
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,760
[Music]

612
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,880
time oh I'm real happy got some jokes I

613
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,600
don't even know if they're going to work

614
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,039
try them out uh half the stuff is stuff

615
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,200
that I've definitely never done here as

616
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:24,159
a contest

617
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:27,360
before um we'll see excited most prelims

618
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,399
though there's only good three sets you

619
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,320
know sometimes there's a fourth good set

620
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:34,000
and it's a little bit agonizing but the

621
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,279
prelims are pretty obvious and then just

622
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,679
every once in a while someone will make

623
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,840
a wacky decision and everybody gets all

624
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,240

644
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:04,200
opener I had an opener I was going to do

645
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,440
a thing where I got up first and I said

646
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,799
I can't believe they didn't announce

647
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,120
this before me but I guess since I'm

648
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,559
first I have to tell you guys cap so

649
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,240
embarrassed that only two women have won

650
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,080
this contest in 30 years and that it's

651
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,360
been 15 years that to balance the scales

652
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,799
all 230 of us have to dress like

653
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,159
this I thought that was a great open I

654
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,840
can't do it halfway [ __ ] through the

655
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,200
lineup I it would only work if I got to

656
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,200

person and Austin contest

672
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,720
H There are 16 contestants tonight each

673
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,399
of them received 10 tickets to

to have them all show up this evening

676
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,919
and

677
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:47,000
clearly a lot of these Comics have no

678
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,760
friends or family so really no point my

679
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,720
name is Matt beard and I'll be your host

680
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,240
for this evening show uh I won the

681
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,639
contest in

682
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,279
1927 and since then I have gone nowhere

683
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,720
so it has really worked out for for me

684
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,320
best of luck to everyone competing this

685
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,799
year maybe somebody will grab the crown

686
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,559
this year and do the same thing I did

687
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,799
which is to have children and give up

688
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:13,760
um if you're competing this evening

689
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,200
ladies and gentlemen uh do pay attention

690
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,120
to the back wall there's a light that

691
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,480
goes on at 5 minutes to let you know you

692
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,200
are nearing the end of your set

693
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,080
generally I will tell you this uh if you

694
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,039
haven't been hilarious in the first

695
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,840
minute the judges have already

696
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,600
discounted you and are probably in the

697
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,480
back smoking cigarettes whatever it is

698
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,760
the judges do and other thing I let you

699
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,960
know is we have judges here it's an

700
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,559
absolute formality we decided who was

701
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,720
actually going to win the entire contest

702
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,919
earlier in the week over some drink so

703
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,399
this is just a way to get in your

704
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:43,440
pockets and steal your money so

705
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,080
woo but so far the only complaint I have

706
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,080
is that everybody has been so goddamn

707
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,159
nice I am still attracted to women on

708
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,919
the theory that you should only change

709
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,919
one team at a

710
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,440
time I'm uh still I'm a member of the

711
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:00,080
trans lesbian Army so I guess I consider

712
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,159
myself a lesbian now I don't know how do

713
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,840
you describe it I don't know what the

714
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,399

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,440

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,240
that everybody's just been so goddamn

728
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,639
nice I took self-defense classes I

729
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,960
bought mace I came up with witty

730
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,279
comebacks and just like what does a lady

731
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,679
have to do to get some oppression up in

732
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:51,399
this [ __ ] you

733
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,279
know do I have to go to Oklahoma I don't

734
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:55,440
want to go to

735
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,039
Oklahoma I should mention I do have two

736
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,320
small children on the use it before you

737
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,399
lose it plan and

738
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,519
um they're great um they've made this so

739
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,440
much easier they're wonderful um and the

740
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,960
only trouble is I have to do regular mom

741
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,320
things uh like this and like in the

742
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,039
regular mom world this is a little

743
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,360
disconcerting so I found sneaky ways to

744
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,240
come out like for instance in my

745
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,760
neighborhood I just uh I just did

746
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,360
Halloween I went trick-or-treating I

747
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,519
didn't put on a costume I wore this and

748
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,480
every time we knocked on the door and

749
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,519
said trick-or treat the people would go

750
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,000

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,640
really anxious and upset about

00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,319

827
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,599
called at the end of this evening if you

828
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,200

829
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,760
lot gets full when everyone rushes at

830
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,079
the same time it did kind of filter into

831
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,400
a nice crowd here this evening if you

832
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,280

833
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,839
that all that's going to happen now is

834
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,079

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,920
standup and I usually will finish out

836
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,720
but uh I'm far more interested in

837
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,240
talking to these lovely Texas women

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,319

reactions I saw on your faces and I

840
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:22,800

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,280

selfie so one of the things that I find

1055
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,000
kind of amusing uh is how the older

1056
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,880

1057
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000

01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:48,240

done hi well the previous two Comics

1386
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
clearly didn't get the memo that it's to

1387
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,440
impress no just kidding I'm transgender

1388
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,119
I guess to look this good every

1389
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,319
day thank you you can start throwing

1390
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:12,160
flowers it's a lot of confusion about

1391
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,319
transgender people um people assume

1392
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,520
because we switched one team we're going

1393
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:17,640
to switch two teams but that's not true

1394
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,920
I'm still attracted to women uh which is

1395
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,480
a little confusing uh I've been trying

1396
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,279
to explain it to people cuz they ask are

1397
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,920
you gay now and I say yes and they go so

1398
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:26,480
you're into men and I say no I'm into

1399
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,640
women but you're not gay then no I am

1400
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,559
gay it's like like it's very simple I'm

1401
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,760
just I'm the kind of homosexual who

1402
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,920
wants to put a penis in a vagina I don't

1403
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,920
know why that's so

1404
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,680
hard you know and it's just an absurd

1405
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:45,599
thing to say but that night when I said

1406
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,559
it I felt very sad and lonely to me

1407
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,279
because I think I was having issues with

1408
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,400
self-esteem dating was going weird I was

1409
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:56,720
all up in my head about how people saw

1410
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:58,880
me um from a sexual interest point

1411
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,920
and um I didn't think it was funny that

1412
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,559
night you know what I mean the joke

1413
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,559
wasn't funny to

1414
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:11,200
me all right I Won't Say I'm thinking

1415
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:15,119
about next year yet not in a big rush to

1416
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,760
do it again but I will that's the that's

1417
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,319
the curse of this is that you do it

1418
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,000
every year until you get it right or

1419
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:23,880
learn you don't need it thank you so

1420
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,559
much for coming out we super appreciate

1421
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,559
one more time for these guys thank you

1422
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:41,000
yay there you go John thank you that was

1423
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,559
awesome oh I think it look great I mean

1424
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,319
I honestly this would be the same face

1425
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,319
I'd have if I made it because I'm so out

1426
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:51,400
of it right now it doesn't make you any

1427
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:53,920
less funny you know losing is not really

1428
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:56,359
losing you can still persevere without

1429
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,559
being one of the top choice and still be

1430
01:06:56,359 --> 01:07:00,760
productive and funny so yeah people are

1431
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:03,279
going to be mad if they didn't make it

1432
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:06,279
in and you

1433
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:07,480

1434
01:07:06,279 --> 01:07:10,480

01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:10,000
and he was really funny but I I was a

1629
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,840
little

1630
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:17,239
like again I don't think any of the

1631
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:19,920
winners from the past 15 years from 2000

1632
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:22,120
on have been undeserving I've seen all

1633
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,719
of them do sets they are all still

1634
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,120
active in the scene except for like one

1635
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:26,520
or two people who have moved on bigger

1636
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,719
things and other scenes you know what I

1637
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:31,320
mean these are all great comics and so

1638
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:34,719
there's no like well that was a fluke

1639
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:36,960
year I mean you know I mean the evidence

1640
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:40,360
is staring you in the face when year

1641
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:43,239
after year after year uh these unbiased

1642
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:44,840
judges come back with the same results I

1643
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:47,800
think it's a resounding yes straight

1644
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:50,480
white men have it when it come to uh to

1645
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:53,440
to to Comedy uh and I say that as a

1646
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,880
straight white man um so it's your

1647
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,960
excuse

1648
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:01,320
I do think the same judges Circle

1649
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,920
through for finals year after year and

1650
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,480
as much as I appreciate their industry

1651
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,719
experience and the uh knowledge that

1652
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:09,320
they bring to the table why not try a

1653
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:11,960
new panel there's other people with

1654
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:15,880
industry experience maybe the panel of

1655
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,280
Judges being different or diverse might

1656
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,639
tweak the results up a little bit over

1657
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,920
the Long Haul Austin is a hole is is

1658
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:23,280
inexcusable I mean I came from Houston

1659
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,520
and the fact that I come there from

1660
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,600
Houston and and it's 20 years later I'm

1661
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,440
still hipper than in a race relation

1662
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,760
wise and everybody in Austin's kind of

1663
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,199
ridiculous you know so I'm the guy with

1664
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,800
the cowboy hat I shouldn't be getting

1665
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:37,840
along with everybody like that I feel

1666
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,440
like Austin is just now becoming super

1667
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,080
diverse in its comedy scene does that

1668
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,000
make sense like I feel like maybe in the

1669
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,840
mid 2000s it was like yeah it was

1670
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:49,199
probably super white and it's white now

1671
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:52,360
obviously that's the majority but like I

1672
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:56,679
don't know there's lots of funny uh

1673
01:19:52,360 --> 01:20:01,520
women in the scene and you know nonwhite

1674
01:19:56,679 --> 01:20:01,520
dudes doing non-white [ __ ] male

1675
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:10,400
comedy I have to work at H Quality

1685
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:53,120

01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:55,199
cape and Crown right now and I well you

1687
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:58,400
know it's not a big deal

1688
01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:00,000
I just uh sure yeah I was actually

1689
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,159
pounding the dashboard last night cuz I

1690
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,080
was excited I don't have to do the

1691
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:05,280
contest anymore that was the thing I was

1692
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,280
most

1693
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:13,159
[Music]

1694
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:15,120
excited afterwards I was just really

1695
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:17,639
excited for everyone and then the

1696
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:20,880
following days I kind of got like a

1697
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:23,120
little gloomy and Moody and then I just

1698
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,920
told myself to snap out of it and stop

1699
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:32,480
being a little [ __ ] and I

1700
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:34,639
[Music]

1701
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,440
did I don't think I'm going to do the

1702
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:38,920
contest next year you could have

1703
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:43,560
interviewed me at any time in the last

1704
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:45,159
13 years and found a day uh at least one

1705
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,960
day a month where I was saying [ __ ] this

1706
01:21:45,159 --> 01:21:49,199
I'm not doing this anymore because it's

1707
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,760
I mean it's heartbreaking at times every

1708
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:53,639
time you have a bad

1709
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:56,480
set you're like why do I [ __ ] do this

1710
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:58,480
we do it because we love it and then if

1711
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,960
you are successful and you can make a

1712
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:04,400
living doing it that's even better but I

1713
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:07,480
mean you're doing it hopefully because

1714
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,480
you just love doing

1715
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,960
it this was probably easily my best

1716
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,560
contest in terms of getting something

1717
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,840
out of it you know I got to advance one

1718
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,679
round I got a great tape from it I'm

1719
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:29,080
getting um name recognition with this

1720
01:22:26,679 --> 01:22:32,000
act which actually is kind of

1721
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:34,400
awkward I've um kind of accelerated my

1722
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,560
plans to change my name because I was

1723
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:40,360
starting to get too much recognition

1724
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:42,600
with this fake stage

1725
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:46,360
name I have a name that I want to use

1726
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:49,440
and I'm having a big party to unveil it

1727
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:51,600
and move on and like it'll be the third

1728
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,600
time I've had to start over with a name

1729
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,440
on a poster as a comedian but I think

1730
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,440
it's worth it

1731
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:05,120
this is the first year where I knew all

1732
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,760
the finalists pretty much and I'm like

1733
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,560
pretty close buddies with them all so

1734
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,880
that was pretty special I mean you know

1735
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,199
I just been doing shows been having a

1736
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,600
lot of fun trying to get Stephanie to

1737
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:16,000
Austin and uh feel like I'm getting

1738
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,600
close to my comedy goals people say they

1739
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
want to do comedy for a living and I

1740
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,920
don't really know how you can do that I

1741
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,520
mean seems kind of hard so I'm just

1742
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,480
going to do comedy and try and

1743
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,630
live I need to figure out a few other

1744
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:33,640
part the

1745
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:33,640
[Music]

1746
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,480
equation that [ __ ] is very stressful

1747
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:41,639
like people be trying to be like a man I

1748
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:43,360
ain't I don't care about the contest you

1749
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:45,679
care about the contest don't even

1750
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,480
[ __ ] lie like we all care about it

1751
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,360
because it could be a situation of a

1752
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,159
make or break thing like you could meet

1753
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:56,120
somebody I met an agent a legit like

1754
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:58,400
talent agent wanted to sign me but you

1755
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,960
know had I not done the contest ain't no

1756
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:03,000
telling if this lady would have ever

1757
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:06,840
reached out to me so it's very important

1758
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,880
and like right now I can't really say

1759
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:11,199
you know it could I could do it next

1760
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,000
year I could come back like [ __ ]

1761
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,840
Michael Jordan retired and come back

1762
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,920
like

1763
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:21,840
psych so we'll see we'll see we'll we

1764
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,840
won't rule it out completely

1765
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,600
and ladies and gentlemen this year's

1766
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:31,280
funniest person in Austin everybody

1767
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,280
leanda

1768
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,440
ler when I see people do well in the

1769
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,119
contest and they walk off stage and you

1770
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,480
can tell when they feel good you can

1771
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:55,440
tell when they shake your like when know

1772
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:57,760
you're hosting and you walk up and I

1773
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,960
always like to shake a hand it's the

1774
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:03,639
whole reason I went that night it also

1775
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:05,600
hurts when I see someone not do their

1776
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:07,840
best and they know it because you see

1777
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,560
their shoulders when they walk up and

1778
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,040
that's tough too especially except I

1779
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,679
think that I should always be able to

1780
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:18,320
whisper the knowledge in their ear you

1781
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:18,320
can go get a drink now it's over
