a little vacation but it was uh I don't

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,800
but it was by myself and when I came

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,280
back my friend said uh she asked me how

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,240
is your

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,880
mancation and uh that enraged me because

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,080
it doesn't just because I'm a guy it

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,680
doesn't it doesn't sound like vacation

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,439
it's a bad pun there's nothing worse

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,560
somebody told me the other day I was

27
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,520
instead of explaining they said

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,320
mansplaining that doesn't sound like

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,240
explaining mancation doesn't sound like

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,520
vacation right I've heard uh L

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,040
manscaping for when you shave your back

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,920
that sound sounds like landscaping

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,240
that's a good pun use that

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,880

little voice in the back of my head that

363
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,199

use and I'm not even sure it's a muscle

525
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,960

526
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,200

welcome thanks for having me yeah no

555
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,960
problem how'd you get here where you

556
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,039
from oh I'm I live in Los Angeles now

557
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,000
originally from Dayton Ohio the former

558
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,640
home of uh Oliver and Wilbur Wright

559
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,279
yeah the inventors of flight but I

560
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,960
thought they I thought that was

561
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,799
Kittyhawk no I mean we don't need to get

562
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,600
into the Ohio vers North Carolina

563
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,480
discussion that war is being waged on

564
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,880
license plates currently Ohio Dayton

565
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,600
Ohio was where they were born and they

566
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,039
had their bicycle shop and where they

567
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,080
invented the airplane is that okay they

568
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,919
just didn't have the proper Hill to fly

569
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,120
it off in Dayton so that's why they took

570
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,480
the plane down to Kittyhawk so basically

571
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,919
that's like saying uh you know let's say

572
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,000
I invented like the coolest time travel

573
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
machine but I didn't have the right

574
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,159
temperature uh in where I live to do it

575
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,679
so I brought it over to your house and

576
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,880
then you start uh just putting banners

577
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,880

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,799

581
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,799
says First in Flight first and flight

582
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
yeah it's like people in North Carolina

583
00:23:53,799 --> 00:24:00,159

584
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,080

589
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,279
me too like I got creeped out the other

590
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,440

wore leather was you know it was

593
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,559
probably a man

594
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,440
you allegedly it happened over 100

595
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,000
thousand years ago it's when it first

596
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,640
happened there probably a man standing

597
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,159
in a field like oh look at that peaceful

598
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,240
sentient

599
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:38,000
being just chewing grass mining its own

600
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,159
business I'm going to sneak up behind

601
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,080
it and then I'm going to kill it cuz I

602
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,760
can and then I'm going to peel all of

603
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,600
its skin off of its body so I can wear

604
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,600
it like it's my

605
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,080
own you do that to a cow It's Fashion

606
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,159
you want to do it to another person

607
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,200
you're a

608
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,760
psychopath what's the real difference

609
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,640
dude you like these pants

610
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,640
these are Theodore from

611
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:08,880
accounting he was a real heer that

612
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,799
one you have a podcast yeah I sure do

613
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,799
it's called me and paranormal you I call

614
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,880
it a minecast because I'm a weird I try

615
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,320
to differentiate it I think as far as I

616
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,960
know it's the only mind cast out there

617
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,240
many people have a podcast that's right

618
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,120
I'm not sure how many people have a mind

619
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,919
cast I interview people with paranormal

620
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,919
abilities or experiences so it's pretty

621
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,919
fun

622
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,559
kind of like a coast to coast thing

623
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,919
maybe I love Coast to Coast Coast to

624
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,120
Coast uh big big influence on me because

625
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,399
when I first started doing standup

626
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,399
comedy on the road from Ohio and many

627
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:47,720
late nights driving in the middle of

628
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:49,720
nowhere yeah always find Coast to Coast

629
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,840
that was the one radio program you could

630
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,159
usually find yeah at 2: in the morning

631
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,360
when you're driving through the hills I

632
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,000
wonder why maybe they must have had a

633
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,760
lot of fans that would just Bounce It

634
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,760
Off different things and oh yeah I mean

635
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,720
pretty much every Fox AM news station AM

636
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,679
radio station carried it so it was

637
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,159
syndicated it was one of the few huge

638
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,240
syndicated programs yeah so yeah loved

639
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,520
it man loved driving through the

640
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,240
mountains at 2 in the morning listening

641
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,360

643
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,880
Atlantis most of the time though

644
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,679

646
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
like not because I use it but I was

647
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,360

648
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,720
baffled by the device like I don't know

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,039
if you've ever just been baffled by a

650
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,919
device like what who did this how did

651
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,559
how does this what you know like

652
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,960
sometime in the past somebody said I

653
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,240
want to harness the power of the wind in

654
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,919
my

655
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,279
fist but slightly warmer you

656
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,919
know they invented the blow dryer well

657
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:52,039
done person [ __ ] it's got electricity in

658
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,600
it like oh that's magic dude electricity

659
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:56,200
is just invisible [ __ ] like oh I'll

660
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,279
never I'll never understand it like

661
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,240
television how that works oh don't

662
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,600
[ __ ] try to explain it to me uh

663
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,679
there's two things in this life I will

664
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,080
never understand how television works

665
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,520
and craps I lose so much money playing

666
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,840
craps I just can't figure out I know the

667
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,559
casino's close by and I'm going to go

668
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,559
later tonight and just lose everything I

669
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,559
can't wait but

670
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,080
uh I was raised in an Irish Catholic

671
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,600
gambling family so it's like I've been

672
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,279
gambling since I came out of the womb I

673
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,279
think I probably was a bet actually

674
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,320
uh I don't if I was a winner or a loser

675
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,000
but I think my mom's still holding on to

676
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,480
that ticket it'll pay off one of these

677
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,080
days just show kid just show what's

678
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,080
don't even have the

679
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,320
place that's

680
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,799
okay I do I've been gambling my whole

681
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,200
life oh man I love it too my family they

682
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,760
gamble on everything cards poker

683
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:58,880
horseshoes darts all that kind of stuff

684
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,880
cornhole that's a backyard game not a

685
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,640
I remember one Christmas I lost was

686
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,399
close to $200 at the poker table and

687
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,919
most of it to my grandma

688
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,880
and that's a lot of money to lose right

689
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,320
so I was upset about it and uh and my

690
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,679
grandma noce I was upset she goes well

691
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,240
you shouldn't be gambling with money you

692
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,640
can't afford to lose I was like I'm 11

693
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
years old

694
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,000
grandma my gift this year was just a

695
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,000
card with a $50 bill that said see you

696
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,320
at the table this is some

697
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,760
[ __ ] like you're setting me up for

698
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,120
this I was set

699
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,640
up of all the things paranormal why are

700
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,519
comedians into

701
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,039
Bigfoot I think comedians are into

702
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,720
Bigfoot because there's mystery there

703
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,880
and there's also there's danger there's

704
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,120
mystery uh and we also have more time

705
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,399
during our days to be on YouTube is it

706
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,000
because of the long drives and that's

707
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,720
the long drives you you see all of the

708
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,640
unexplored area and you're like oh yeah

709
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,559
easily

710
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,600
could living that we Haven and there's

711
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,720
also very Stakes about it comedians

712
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,120
devote their life to the SL possibility

713
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,120
that they'll make it yeah it's so rare

714
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,919
that we can make it right so being a

715
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,159
successful comedian is almost like being

716
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,039
Bigfoot you just hope people find you

717
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,480
yeah ladies and gentlemen that was Ryan

718
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,480
Singer Bigfoot is

719
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,480
real God my family is pretty cool I got

720
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,039
cool parents uh my parents got divorced

721
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,000
when I was about to 16 years old um and

722
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:34,799
they remained single for about five six

723
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,600
years before they got remarried so I

724
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,880
turned 21 years old and both my parents

725
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,120

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,240
which on paper might sound cool you know

728
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
like being out with your dad trying to

729
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,919
meet your new mom together but

730
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,320
uh but it led to some like weird fights

731
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,840
at the bar my dad would be like hey look

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,720

end up marrying her I'm just going to

737
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,960
have to move in the house and act like a

738
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,200
Sleepwalk every time she showers that's

739
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,600
going to be

740
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,000
weird but leave her to leave her to me

741
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,880
and your will if you don't mind uh women

742
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,960
are not property

743
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,440
uh it's a socially conscious joke uh

744
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,640
even worse though being out with my mom

745
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,159

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,880
know my dad's a pretty cool dude my dad

767
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:14,279
is a common please court judge in the

768
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,919
state of Ohio where I grew up uh Ohio

769
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,760
has capital punishment which means that

770
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,519
if someone's found guilty of murder in

771
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,840
his courtroom uh he can sentence them to

772
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,399
death right and uh which is a crazy

773
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,200
power for a person to have especially

774
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,919
when they're in charge of your curfew

775
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,240
and

776
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,039
discipline you better be home by 11 yes

777
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,679
sir I

778
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,279
will my dad is a uh Republican which is

779
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,000
fine he's a Christian which is fine I

780
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,159
don't have a problem with either either

781
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
one of those things but what that

782
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,919
combination means is he's against

783
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,320
abortion but for capital punishment

784
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,080
right and my simple brain locks up when

785
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,399
I try to figure out that combo like like

786
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,720
to me that's like saying I'm I'm against

787
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,039
you know totally against the consumption

788
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,159
of cookie dough but I believe it's

789
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:55,159
perfectly okay to eat

790
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,840
cookies you know

791
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,440
you'd have all the same political

792
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,000
arguments too you know what I mean you'd

793
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,159
have you'd have the liberal left you

794
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,440
know like oh everybody knows cookie does

795
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,440
not a cookie until it pops out of the

796
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,039
oven unless you can stick a fork in and

797
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,559
out of a cookie cleanly it's not a

798
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,559
cookie it's not a

799
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,519
cookie you'd have the middle of the road

800
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,600
we believe in partially cooked

801
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,120
consumption uh cuz our chefs have proven

802
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,480
that after 4 minutes in the oven cookie

803
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,799
dough gets a brown

804
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,080
bottom and the signifying trait of a

805
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,559
cookie is a brown

806
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,840
bottom you'd have the conservative right

807
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,919
did you know that at its Inception

808
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,399
cookie dough has completely formed

809
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,399
chocolate

810
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,519
chips listen as a man I don't believe

811
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,600
I'm entitled to an opinion on this

812
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,320
matter uh cuz I know the kitchen is a

813
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,240
woman's place and

814
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,440
uh that's the kitchen

815
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,200
okay don't let the metaphor break down

816
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,440
at the end this is this is where babies

817
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,440
get cooked in the

818
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
kitchen okay
