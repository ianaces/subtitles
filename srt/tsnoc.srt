00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
hi I'm Tim slel and you're about to

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,439
watch a nation of criminals this was the

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,279
second video I did about 18 years ago uh

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,880
you will notice that the artwork does

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,800
not match the look I had at that time in

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,599
the early days I was changing my look

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,800
all the time another IC once said that I

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,520
spent more time looking for my hook than

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,640
a blind pirate on Shor leaf and I did

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
the show while I still had my dreadlocks

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,360
I had the artwork paid for

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,039
um and I had two shows that night the

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,440
first show was probably the best show

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,079
I've ever had in my life it was uh uh 20

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,000
minutes I did two shows it was 20

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,719
minutes longer than the other show even

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,640
though it was the exact same show

18
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,519
because of all the laughter and Applause

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,719
that's that's how solid that set was

20
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,799
I've never had a better show before or

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,799
since and uh both cameramen thought that

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,360
the other one was recording the sound

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,520
there was a so there was no sound for it

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,680
it was just me talking into a mic and

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,840
I'm not that good of a mime so uh I I

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,400
after I changed my look I realized that

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,840
I I didn't want to waste I didn't want

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,360
to burn the the the money I had spent to

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,960

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,120
people in California man they figured

77
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,239
because they purchased the real estate

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,519

into the

112
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,960
Earth and I know we probably got at

113
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,160
least one environmentalist in here

114
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,199
thinking oh yeah you're laughing now

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,800
yeah when those ice caps start melting

116
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,840
you're going to be laughing underwater

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,560
pal cuz that's what they're telling us

118
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,800
is going to happen that the ice caps are

119
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,199
going to melt the oceans are going to

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,360
rise and we're all going to

121
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,800
drown last time I was here somebody

122
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,639
actually told me that because the Twin

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,560
Cities have the river going right

124
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,840
through them that you know they're going

125
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,840
to be underwater really

126
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,479
quickly yeah forgetting of course that

127
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:34,280
the Twin Cities are 1200 ft above sea

128
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,919
L if the ocean comes up that high we're

129
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,880
pretty much screwed

130
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,680
anyway at that point you're going to be

131
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,199
the east coast of

132
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,280
[Laughter]

133
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,039
Denver I don't think that's going to

134
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,840
happen you know you granted we might

135
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,440
lose you know a little beachfront

136
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,440
property screw

137
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,199
them shorter drive to the ocean for

138
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,560
me yeah don't look at it as tragedy look

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,560
at it as climactic

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,000
Justice and I don't even know if it's

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,840
true and I know you've all heard it too

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,160
that they they said that that ice caps

143
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,560
are going to melt well the ice has to go

144
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,199
somewhere where else is it going to go

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,400
well it's going to make the Oceans Rise

146
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,840
you forgetting of course that the ice

147
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,840
camps

148
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,879
float how much does the level of a glass

149
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,160
of Coke rise when the floating Ice Cube

150
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:38,319
melts in

151
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,319
it I think they're lying to

152
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,680
us either that are they flunk

153
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,159
geography and did you see what happened

154
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:54,639
in Montreal last last winter it got

155
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,879
cold they had 6in sheets across most of

156
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,560
Montreal sheets of ice across the city

157
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,319
for the majority of the winter

158
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,840
it looks like the Glaciers are coming

159
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,120
south again to me and I said there you

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,520
go you can't have 6in sheets of ice in

161
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,879
Montreal and global warming but I was

162
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,479
corrected by USA

163
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,479
Today they said don't start thinking for

164
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,159
yourself they actually said that the

165
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,280
reason why it got so cold in Montreal

166
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,280
was because of global

167
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
warming I guess I'm just stupid

168
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,120
you know cuz I was kind of figuring that

169
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,919
Global would imply

170
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,919
Earth warming might

171
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,919
imply

172
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,880
hotter well that goes to show how

173
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,680
environmentally ignorant I

174
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,080
am would seem global warming can cause

175
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,760
anything it can cause it to get warmer

176
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,880
sure but it could also cause it to get

177
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,440
colder or it could cause celebrities to

178
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,440
ski into trees for no apparent reason

179
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:10,360
oh what a strange winner we had last

180
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,360
year that's El

181
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:21,279
Nino I actually heard Al Gore say that

182
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,279
El Nino is Spanish for global

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,040
warming yeah I think Al Gore is Democrat

184
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,040
for Dan quail

185
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,870
[Applause]

186
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,360
[Laughter]

187
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,320
[Applause]

188
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,160
granted I'm pretty sure Al Gore knows

189
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,160
how to spell

190
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,690
potato I would bet that Dan Quail knows

191
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,079
that Michael Jackson doesn't play

192
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,760
[Laughter]

193
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,120
basketball you don't you don't know what

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,560
I'm talking

195
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,600
about you didn't hear that here did you

196
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,160
they they actually asked El Gore what he

197
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,640
said about what he thought about the

198
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:10,040
last Bulls championship in Chicago last

199
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,320
basketball and Al Gore responded and I

200
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,560
quote boy that Michael Jackson's

201
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,170
probably the best basketball player

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,600
we've ever

203
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:24,040
[Laughter]

204
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,110
seen the man is a cigar length from the

205
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,070
Oval Office

206
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,070
[Applause]

207
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,519
know that don't

208
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,519
you does that worry anyone but

209
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,320
me I think I think that Al Gore is the

210
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,320
number one reason why Bill Clinton

211
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,000
should not

212
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,480
[Laughter]

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,399
reside Al Gore man Al Gore is one of

214
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,800
these control freaks Al Gore is one of

215
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,639
these guys that want to tell us how we

216
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,600
live cuz we're doing it wrong you know

217
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,800
he thinks that we be a much better place

218
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,839
if we drove electric cars yeah not him

219
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,399
no no he still needs you know the

220
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:13,279
petroleum drinking armored limousine the

221
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,920
motorcade and the dc9 you know he's

222
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,959
talking about you

223
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,480
people and you people are spoiling the

224
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,160
Earth by driving your

225
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,560
cars wants us to drive electric cars

226
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,760
like like the ev1 heard about this first

227
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,760
production electric car GM

228
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,040
$335,000 for a car with no heat or air

229
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,399
conditioning top speed about 60 M an

230
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,399
hour for an hour before you plug it in

231
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,560
overnight oh where do I sign up for

232
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,800
that and Al Gore man he doesn't even see

233
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,720
that there might be a flaw or two with

234
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,240
this

235
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,880
design he's like well sure you're going

236
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,839
to have to make some small

237
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,839
sacrifices wait a

238
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:10,200
minute 2 days to drive a 100 miles is

239
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,680
not a small sacrifice you further in a

240
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,199
day in a godamn covered wagon than an

241
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,199
electric

242
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,079
car yeah but at least it's going to help

243
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,959
the

244
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,839
environment

245
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:30,240
how cuz the electricity has to come from

246
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,480
someplace it doesn't just grow out of

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
the

248
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,360
socket you have to generate the

249
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,519
electricity in this country we generate

250
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,639
the majority of our electricity by

251
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:47,000
burning fossil fuel the same exact thing

252
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm doing under the hood of my

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,720
car somehow cuz it happens in the power

254
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,519
plant where you can't see it that helps

255
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,399
the

256
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,240
environment yeah could you imagine how

257
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,800
stupid you would have felt driving an

258
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,560
electric car in Montreal last

259
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,880
winner yeah cuz they didn't have

260
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,880
electricity for like 2

261
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:14,639
months you would have had to actually

262
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,560
walk to the gas station to buy a gallon

263
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,800
of

264
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,040
gas so that you could run the generator

265
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,440
for a couple

266
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,040
hours to charge up your

267
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,040
car you could drive to the gas station

268
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040
for a little more gas

269
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,800
see I think people just have to get used

270
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,600
to the notion that there's absolutely no

271
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,760
natural way to fly through the

272
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,360
countryside at 70 M an hour if pollution

273
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,360
bothers you

274
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
walk and that's what I think we'd have

275
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,880
to do if we were serious about all this

276
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,320
save the Earth

277
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,079
crap each and every one of us would be

278
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,639
perfectly willing to spend the rest of

279
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:04,759
our lives without cars or toilet paper

280
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,759
or underarm deodorant man I'd rather be

281
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,880
dead who wants to live like the

282
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,240
Amish corn cops don't even sound

283
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,240
Pleasant to

284
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,120
me I think that death would be a

285
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,360
preferable option to a life of hard work

286
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,360
and

287
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,000
ouses death I have no trouble with

288
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:36,600
I'm like 40 years old

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,800
now granted a hard

290
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,920
40 you know what at this point I've

291
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,000
already outlived James Dean Elvis

292
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,600
Presley and Jesus

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,600
Christ hell I'm in the bonus round

294
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,560
anyway and I think you people that are

295
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,560
afraid of death are ultimately afraid of

296
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,040
change and death probably isn't that bad

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,040
you can sleep in every

298
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,720
morning sounds way cool to

299
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,680
me oh I meaning I really admire those of

300
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,320
you that find themselves able to get up

301
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,470
and go to work every day God bless

302
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,000
you I don't know how the hell you do

303
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,759
[Laughter]

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,279
that now myself I've been able to get up

305
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,319
in time to shave shower and have the

306
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,319
application in

307
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,000
early you know what after you get the

308
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,110
job they expect you there at that same

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,720
hour every goddamn

310
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,440
[Laughter]

311
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,440
morning I could work 9

312
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,440
to5

313
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,040
Wednesdays any more than that severely

314
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,040
hinders my drinking ability

315
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh My Philosophy has always been that a

316
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,759
hangover is just your body's way of

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
telling you you shouldn't have stopped

318
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,560
drinking you laugh but I'm Stone

319
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,480
serious I got in this business 18 years

320
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,240
ago after flunking out of college and

321
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,639
finding myself unable to hold down a day

322
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,720
job during one of my last meetings with

323
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,399
one of my last bosses he actually said

324
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,160
Mr slel what do you want out of a

325
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,000
job I thought about that question like

326
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,680
like I just heard it for the very first

327
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,680
time I thought God what what do I

328
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:51,279
want I want to sleep till noon every

329
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,279
day work an hour or

330
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,240
less I want to be able to say whatever

331
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,759
the hell I

332
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,759
want hang out bars and get free

333
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,339
beer Yello and behold 15 years later

334
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,499
that's exactly what I'm

335
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,499
[Applause]

336
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,000
doing Isn't it nice to know we live in a

337
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,760
country where you can achieve anything

338
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,760
you aspire

339
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,880
to I love to tease the Amish though

340
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:40,690
cuz you know they they can't come

341
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:40,690
[Laughter]

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,400
here and it probably wouldn't matter

343
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,799
anyway because I'm sure that the Amish

344
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,880
have such a great sense of humor I think

345
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,480
they're one of these groups that you

346
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,000
know everyone can still make fun of them

347
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,160
and everyone has a good time which is

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,039
great because man there's other groups

349
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,400
today that you cannot make fun

350
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,919
of and sometimes the difference of

351
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,679
between a group that you can make fun of

352
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,679
in a group that you can't is just a

353
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,600
hairline for instance how do we

354
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,600
celebrate St Patrick's Day in America

355
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,120
what do we do we drink yeah we drink

356
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,799
until we puke up every green thing we've

357
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,240
had to drink that

358
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,840
evening yeah that's the reverence that

359
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,840
we hold for Irish

360
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,840
heritage in America and its impact on

361
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,840
our diversity

362
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,240
by taking what was at one point the most

363
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,240
holy day in all of

364
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Ireland using it as an excuse for

365
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,510
everyone else to imitate the worst

366
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,480
stereotype of the Irish

367
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,679
[Laughter]

368
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,240
people man isn't that kind of like

369
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,240
spending Martin Luther King Day eating

370
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,720
ribs and drinking Malt

371
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,720
Liquor woo

372
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,480
oh I sense a few of you uncomfortable

chicken that's

406
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,760

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,799
recipes everything we call Southern Home

433
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,400
Cooking was invented by a black American

434
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,880
you think Colonel Sanders invented fried

435
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,200

444
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,400
My First Amendment right to free

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,480
idea cuz you know you should punish hate

451
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,000
crimes worse than other

452
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,919
crimes no I mean come on if you killed

453
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,080
someone because you hated them that is a

454
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,400
whole lot worse than if you were to just

455
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,400
kill

456
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,520

465
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,440
crimes Barney the purple

dinosaur oh even murderers need love

467
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,720
that's what I think's wrong with America

468
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,600
personally I think we've got too many

469
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:13,240
big purple dinosaurs writing

470
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,240
laws like Teddy

471
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:23,799
Kennedy oh he is big and

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,799
purple just one varicose vein ready to

473
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,679
pop I I actually like to call Teddy the

474
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,760
control Kennedy

475
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,159
if you remember your your labs in high

476
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
school you would always have a control

477
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,840
to prove the results of the

478
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,559
experiment see I think Teddy is what

479
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,559
happens when you let a Kennedy live past

480
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,520
[Applause]

481
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,080

482
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,320
time to let

00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,000
go and if you can remember back some to

484
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,120
to the glory if you can remember back to

485
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,679
some of the touch football footage you

486
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,080
know back before they thought of playing

487
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:08,120
it on

488
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,720
[Laughter]

489
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,480
skis back when Teddy was playing

490
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,640
football alongside Bobby and Jack Teddy

491
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,279

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,520
one yeah imagine what trolls those other

493
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,520
two would have turned out to

494
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,320
be oh man if I were John John I'd steer

495
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,320
for the tree

496
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,880
cuz you know in 1993 they named People

497
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,520
magazine named John John Kennedy the

498
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,159
hunk of the

499
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,760
Year people yeah yeah which is kind of

500
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,000
weird if you think about it because you

501
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,279
know when you're talking about something

502
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,320
other than Kennedy's like candy or

503
00:25:51,279 --> 00:26:00,240
cake isn't a

504
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,240
hunk the same thing as a piece

505
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,760
could you imagine People magazine

506
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,760
calling Carolyn the best piece of

507
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,200
93 that doesn't seem

508
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,480
right see I think though men have a

509
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,919
better sense of humor about stuff like

510
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,919
that oh come

511
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,840
on men call themselves dick

512
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,720
yeah short for

513
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,720
Richard don't know how it's short for

514
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,410
Richard I have never figured out how you

515
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,200
can shorten by adding a d and a

516
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:48,760
[Laughter]

517
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,440
k I think that men named Richard just

518
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,360
like the fact that they can go around

519
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,360
going hi my name's Richard

520
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:03,520
but why don't you just call me dick

521
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,520
[Laughter]

522
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,600
I have never seen the name constant

523
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,600
shortened Beyond

524
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,520
[Music]

525
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,520
Connie where's the sense of humor

526
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,240
now could you imagine a woman

527
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,760
introducing herself to you like

528
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,399
that coming up and going hi my name's

529
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,399
really constants but you can call

530
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,770
me

531
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,859
[Laughter]

532
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,859

Forbidden

543
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,760
hell you got to work on demographics

544
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,760
when you're forming the Forbidden

545
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,399
one men don't mind if you call him

546
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,840

561
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,039
ever have gender equality true gender

562
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,880
equality as long as that word is an

563
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,240
offensive

564
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,200
one and I think the reason why it's a

565
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,039
much more offensive word than

566
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,919
dick is we've kind of been brainwashed

567
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,720
by society and into believing that men

568
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,200
are born with something good that you

569
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,519
should be proud of and women have

570
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,170
something shameful that you should wash

571
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,900
a lot

572
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,900
[Laughter]

573
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,279
it's

574
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,559
true I have never known a man to own a

575
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,559
vinegar and water

576
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,840
squirter but you watch afternoon TV

577
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,880
women are made to feel like pigs if they

578
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,880
haven't been using one three times a day

579
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,919
have you ever seen a can of masculine

580
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,919
hygiene spray

581
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,279
deodorant and I know there's probably

582
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,279
men that can use it

583
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,720
too men

584
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,200
won't men figure if it stinks it's

585
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,200
supposed to

586
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,569
[Applause]

587
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,679
you can't get man to spray anything

588
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,679
until it starts to

589
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,120
EG even then he's going to try to

590
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,120
scratch it away for a week or

591
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,510
two before he makes that embarrassing

592
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,320
trip into Walmart

593
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:32,639
[Laughter]

594
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,880
you might well laughing

595
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:35,990
here that's the one that kept me off

596
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,000
star

597
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:43,320
[Laughter]

598
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
search that's what's known as a bad

599
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,000
judgment

600
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:54,039
P I thought it was a hot five minute

601
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,039
bit judges did not

602
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:04,700
concur zero stars for the she

603
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:04,700
[Laughter]

604
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,799
crotch people are just too dang

605
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:13,480
sensitive

606
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,799
that's that's my

607
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,639
conclusion see the National Association

608
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,720
for the blind boycotted Walt Disney did

609
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:22,600
you hear about that they boycotted Walt

610
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,600
Disney because Walt Disney did a remake

611
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,760
of Mr

612
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,519
meoo and Mr Meo happens to be offensive

613
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,440
to div vision impaired

614
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,440
like they're going to see

615
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,159

617
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,679
cartoon how seriously are we going to

618
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,919
start taking cartoons now are the French

619
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,320
people going to boycott Warner Brothers

620
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:54,360
for their little peepy Lew

621
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,399
character cuz if you think about it

622
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:03,080
isn't pepy law an offensive stereotype

623
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:03,080
of a Frenchman over sexed and very

624
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,039
stinky right now Hispanic groups are mad

625
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:16,000
at Taco Bell they want dinky the Taco

626
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,840
Bell Chihuahua pulled off the air

627
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,399
because it's offensive to

628
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,960
Hispanics cuz you see it's a Mexican

629
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,960
dog that eats tacos

630
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,880
and speak

631
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:42,320
[Laughter]

632
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,320
Spanish I think it's offensive to Taco

633
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,480
Bell they're saying they serve dog

634
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,760
[Applause]

635
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,000
food no I mean think about it what else

636
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,320
have you seen dogs eat D you want that

637
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,519
compared to your supper

638
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,950
oh normally I prefer a stinking pile of

639
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:11,420
crap oh and I cannot find one yier Taco

640
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,420
[Laughter]

641
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,960
Bell Joe Camel there's another cartoon

642
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,720
people have taken way too

643
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,480
seriously we had to Outlaw Joe Camel at

644
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,079
the federal level cuz you know he was

645
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,079
just just a tun gone

646
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,520
bad making kids smoke that's what they

647
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,040
said I don't know how they did it he

648
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,040
wasn't even

649
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:47,560
animated but their proof of this

650
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:47,560
ridiculous allegation was it's a cartoon

651
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,760
duh and I guess 133% of kids that smoke

652
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,760
smoke camel so what more do you

653
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,720
need but you know what that doesn't mean

654
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,680
they started smoking camel there is a

655
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,400
big

656
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,880
difference I would bet that 99% of all

657
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,520
kids that smoke probably started smoking

658
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:15,280
the exact brand I did that's whatever

659
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,280
you can rip off from Mom and

660
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,280
Dad not Joe camela Joe

661
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,160
parents my first brand was Paul mul

662
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,960
nonfilter

663
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,960
yeah oh I was hooked in about an

664
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,440
hour see I think anyone that really

665
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,839
believes that they were using Joe Camel

666
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,640
to Target cigarettes to

667
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,920
Children probably thinks that

668
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,840
Metropolitan Life uses Snoopy and

669
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:51,119
Woodstock to get kids into life

670
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,640
[Laughter]

671
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,720
insurance why else would they be using

672
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,359
cartoons

673
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,600
hello they're trying to get kids hooked

674
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:04,680
on

675
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:07,480
[Laughter]

676
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,440
annuities I understand they actually

677
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,000
manipulate the interest rates to get

678
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,000
them hooked

679
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:21,560
quicker yeah I mean come on I grew up

680
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,720
watching The Bugs Bunny Road Runner

681
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:29,560
hour and I have never strapped on a pair

682
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,560
of Acme rocket powered roller skates

683
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,640
yeah I have never tried to catch my

684
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,319
little brother by dumping ball bearings

685
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,319
into his Cheerios and getting a giant

686
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,960
magnet I have never dropped a safe on

687
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,680
anyone well okay there's been instances

688
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,680
not not me but there was that one kid

689
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:05,200
that allegedly watched beas and

690
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:09,760
Butthead started his family's trailer on

691
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,760
fire I think trailer is the

692
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,880
[Applause]

693
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,520
opportunity I think it's the same thing

694
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,040
that happened after after the the movie

695
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,200
the program do you remember that

696
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,599
incident movie about a movie about a

697
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,560
high school football team that would

698
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,160
prove how tough they were by laying down

699
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,760
in the middle of the

700
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,440
expressway yeah and some kids saw the

701
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,599
film and on the way home thought that

702
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,720
they should test the boundaries between

703
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,260
fiction and reality

704
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,419
and guess what

705
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,419
[Music]

706
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,800
happen reality yeah you know this is

707
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,000
just an

708
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,319
exception and when something like this

709
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,010
occurs this is just St Darwin correcting

710
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:57,209
a genetic error

711
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,209
[Applause]

712
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,359
I mean come on if all of America were as

713
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,200
impressionable as these idiots

714
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,520
spawn society would have never survived

715
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,520
the onslaught of The Three

716
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,839
Stooges the United States would have

717
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,280
been wiped out overnight after the first

718
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,960
stoes episode premiered 150 million

719
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,640

survive and man if that weren't enough

727
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,119
we make the millionaires on top of it

728
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,800
but by letting file lawsuits for their

729
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,560
stupidity for things like spilling hot

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,800
that and the hair dryer company's aware

751
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,880
of the thousands of morons still walking

752
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,520
in this

753
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,800
country the potential billions that

754
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,359
could be lost in lawsuits said you know

755
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,400
what we're going to have to

756
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,880
do we're going to have to put a sticker

757
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,079
on that

758
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,670
thing oh let the smart people make fun

759
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,560
of

760
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:53,240
[Laughter]

761
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:58,480
[Applause]

762
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,000
us cuz we do make fun of these stickers

763
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,800
every time you read one of these

764
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,079
ridiculous warnings it always makes you

765
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,160
laugh and you cannot buy anything

766
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,359
without a long list of ridiculous

767
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,079
warnings but remember the fact that

768
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,680
every one of those warnings even

769
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,240
exists means the Earth was once

770
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,160
inhabited by a creature stupid enough to

771
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,160
attempt the stunt

772
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,850
describe with relatives littered enough

773
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:31,850
to find an attorney in the Yellow Pages

774
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,850
[Laughter]

775
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,760
on gas

776
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:43,000
pumps on gas pumps there are warnings

777
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,000
that say can be harmful or fatal if

778
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,240
swallowed oh where we going to go after

779
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,240
last call

780
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,640
now when you go to the market to buy a

781
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,800
package of raw chicken

782
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,590
it will bear a label that says you've

783
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,689
got to cook

784
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,689
[Music]

785
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,880
this oh what a negligent host I've

786
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,040
been usually I serve it right out of the

787
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,839
[Applause]

788
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,160
bag wondered why no one was touching the

789
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,160
chicken salmonella wings

790
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,200
how far are we going to let this

791
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,640
go are we going to pass a law that

792
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,800
requires every American male to get a

793
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,110
tattoo that says has been known to cause

794
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,590
pregnancy do not straddle

795
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:57,520
[Applause]

796
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:57,520
[Laughter]

797
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,640
because we already have laws that

798
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,319
require warnings like the one on

799
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,839
cigarettes it's a law that requires that

800
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,760
warning to be there and I I guess they

801
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,240
want to change that law so that warning

802
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,839
is going to have to be

803
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,920
bigger which is why the nearsighted have

804
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,920
been coming down with

805
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,079
cancer yeah I can't see well enough to

806
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,079
make good health

807
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,119
choices I don't think we need the

808
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,640
government to to get us to quit I think

809
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,640
your own body tells you when to quit

810
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,440
smoking myself I really believe that

811
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,880
each and every one of us has been born

812
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:42,800
with a built-in traffic

813
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,800
light like hey it's green I can keep

814
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,599
[Applause]

815
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:56,000
going yellow would mean slow

816
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,000
down red means stop

817
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:04,119
[Applause]

818
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:04,119
let anything be more

819
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,160
apparent there's actually another law if

820
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,480
you're a smoker and you might not even

821
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,720
be aware of this is a law but I

822
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,839
guarantee man it's changed your

823
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,160
life because before that that it

824
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,440
happened after that beas and Butthead

825
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,480
trailer

826
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,880
incident because before that trailer

827
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,359
went up into

828
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:28,280
flames you used to be able to walk into

829
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:30,440
a 7-Eleven anywhere in America

830
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,440
for about 89 cents you could buy

831
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,599
yourself a disposable lighter that you

832
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:39,359
could light just by going like

833
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,920
that we were in

834
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,440
Peril it's a wonder any of us survive

835
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,440
the fiery

836
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,480
Holocaust cuz now you know when you get

837
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,040
these things they all have that thing in

838
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,440
the side you got to kind of click it and

839
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,720
flick and dozen lines and you got to

840
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,280
click it and flick

841
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,280
click and flick and click and flick and

842
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,280
SP it I'll use

843
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,839
matches they they call this a childproof

844
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,280
lighter cuz only kids can figure out how

845
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:13,280
to use

846
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,559
it and the thing is that really bugs me

847
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,599
is that you don't have a choice on which

848
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,440
form of lighter you'd rather

849
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:25,680
buy I don't have any kids but yet if I

850
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,160
want to buy a disposable lighter I have

851
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,480
to buy a child proof lighter well why

852
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,960
don't you just make me buy a safety seat

853
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,960
for my car while you're at

854
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,640
it you're already making me buy an

855
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,920
airbag for the

856
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,440
car you have no choice in this matter

857
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,400
yeah and it's easy to see why the

858
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,760
government was solding airbags you know

859
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,800
cuz those demonstration films are in

860
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,800
slow motion and in slow motion and

861
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,000
airbag looks

862
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,319
great it it appears as though as the car

863
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,960
Carin into the

864
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:04,960
wall a big comfy pillow

865
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,690
appears so you can kind of snuggle your

866
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,000
head down in

867
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:16,559
[Applause]

868
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,559
there you take a little nap before the

869
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,720
crash turns out that they erupt from the

870
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,920
steering wheel with a trifle more of a

871
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,920
line

872
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,960
vity this Zeppelin actually explodes

873
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,599
from the steering

874
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:44,800
wheel at a speed specified by federal

875
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,800
law at 200 mil an

876
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,640
hour 200 miles an I don't know where

877
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,920
they came up with that figure you know

878
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,200
probably some genius nephew of a

879
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,680
congressman got a job the job doing the

880
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,520
math

881
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,160
well let's see if the car is going 70 M

882
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:08,480
an hour that way and it'ss another car

883
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,400
coming 70 M an hour that way windshield

884
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,720
now approaches your

885
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,720
[Music]

886
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:20,200
face 140 M an

887
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,720
hour the bag has to beat the windshield

888
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,720
to your

889
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,839
face 200 mil an hour

890
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,620
[Applause]

891
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:38,240
exactly can I have my grant

892
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:41,000
[Laughter]

893
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,240
now in order to get them out of out of

894
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,520
the steering wheel that fast they have

895
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,079
to have something inside their a little

896
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,760
device called a propellant canister

897
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,960
which sounds really harmless and inert a

898
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,599
little aerosol job freshen you your the

899
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,599
air and saves your life in one

900
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,079
puff but it's actually packed full of

901
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,800
magn magnesium compound

902
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:06,640
explosive yeah and it's roughly the same

903
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:09,559
size and shape as a shotgun shell

904
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,119
yes so if you would like to experience

905
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:15,480
for

906
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:19,400
yourself the joy of an airbag

907
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,400
deployment go get your daddy's

908
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,440
shotgun tie an old vacuum cleaner bag

909
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,960
around the end of the

910
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,680
muzzle then stick this safety device

911
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,559
through the middle of the steering

912
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,000
column right behind the horn button cuz

913
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,440
you know you are not that coming out and

914
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,920
smacking your head on the way

915
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,359
out just kind of put your face under

916
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,440
there

917
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,440
and give that trigger a little

918
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,040
flip I'm sure you're going to say well

919
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,040
I'd feel safer without

920
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,119
that but you know that's not an

921
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,760
option right even though you know people

922
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:00,720
have been killed by these things heads

923
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,880
have been thrown across parking lots

924
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,440
faces have been torn

925
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,240
off they're still adamant about these

926
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,559
things being in cars and I I'm sure it

927
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,760
has nothing to do with the fact that the

928
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,799
propellant canisters are manufactured by

929
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:17,680
uh government contributor

930
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:19,599
TRW I'm sure that's just a

931
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,160
coincidence but they do have a few

932
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,920
Solutions if you're a little

933
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,640
concerned uh number one they're

934
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,520
requiring that children and elderly

935
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,359
persons always always always ride in the

936

[Music]

967
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,799
the truth and you can't disconnect this

968
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,920
thing do you know that it's a federal

969
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:07,240
crime to pull out the fuse to disable

970
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,000
the airbag in the vehicle that you just

971
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,480
bought yeah I I don't know what they're

972
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,520
going to do to you if they catch you

973
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,930
you'll probably send you to mattress tag

974
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,400
Federal

975
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:21,359
[Laughter]

976
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,319
Penitentiary and people wonder why

977
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,240
there's so much crime around today it's

978
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:27,720
not because of global

979
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,559
warming we don't don't have room for the

980
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,920
real criminals

981
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:34,200
anymore there are so many laws on the

982
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,480
books that I highly doubt there's 100%

983
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,119
Law Abiding Citizen left in the United

984
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,000
States of America we have become a

985
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,559
nation of 250 million criminals just

986
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,599
waiting to be

987
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,440
arrested cuz I would bet that each and

988
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:52,559
every one of us violates at least one

989
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:57,440
law a day especially if you

990
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,440
drive you know unless you're over 65

991
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:02,000
yeah if there's a cop

992
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,720
around yeah me too man when there's a

993
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,680
cop on the road I've got those hands at

994
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:09,400
10 and two seat belts is locked that

995
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,400
speedometer is dead nuts on the

996
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,040
speed ain't no one got the nerve to fly

997
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,720
past a

998
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:21,280
cop cops know

999
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,280
this so they

1000
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,240
hide underneath Bridges and behind

1001
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,280
shrubbery

1002
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,079
cuz they know full well if they were out

1003
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,319
where you could see them everyone would

1004
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:36,040
abide by the speed limit they'd go broke

1005
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:38,559
CU they couldn't write speeding ticket

1006
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,640
yeah so they Park their cars in these

1007
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,280
hiding places just hoping somebody's got

1008
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,880
the nerve to fly past them at a speed

1009
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,880
everyone normally drives

1010
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:53,480
anyway why do we let them do that we're

1011
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:56,680
no isn't the government supposed to be a

1012
00:52:53,480 --> 00:53:00,280
representation of us yeah isn't it

1013
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:03,520
supposed to be We the People yeah we

1014
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,520
would not hide on

1015
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,400
ourselves if we're going too fast you

1016
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:13,559
want to slow us down you don't have to

1017
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,799
hide no put a cop car right there in

1018
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:20,640
plain view lights flashing you know may

1019
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:23,240
maybe an ambulance next to it

1020
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:27,400
yeah three or four stretchers with

1021
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:29,920
mannequins covered with ketchup

1022
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,440
I guarantee no one will go more than 10

1023
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,440
miles an hour past that

1024
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,799
spot be slowing down to snag a better

1025
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:43,760
look you think that was

1026
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:51,440
real we're paying their

1027
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:54,400
salaries they should entertain

1028
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,880
us stage little performance pieces on

1029
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,440
the side of the road little bits of

1030
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,440
ditch the

1031
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,400
theater hire actors to dress up like

1032
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,680
cops and criminals and just let them

1033
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,400
beat the snot out of each other

1034
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,240
there you even have a fake General Store

1035
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,319
where a cowboy gets shot in the chest

1036
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,280
and does a somersault into the mattress

1037
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:20,200
every hour on the hour make it like a

1038
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,520

government doesn't like us having

1042
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,400

1043
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,839

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:05,079
going to lose two 300 lives on the

1052
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:07,760
highways seven fingers in an eyeball

00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:07,760
ain't that

1054
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:13,319
bad turns out it's actually more

1055
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:16,200
dangerous to spend forth of July driving

1056
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:18,920
the family to the beach and it is to

1057
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,600
hang out in the backyard whipping lames

1058
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,730

reservations isn't that kind of

1075
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,359
funny that we have become such a nation

00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,319
Oval Office floor

1119
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:31,200

01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:56,520
here I believe is exactly two votes away

1304
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,119
from uh becoming an illegal joke

1305
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:01,160
because right now that's all there

1306
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:02,520
stands is two senators in between a flag

1307
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,200
burning

1308
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,559
Amendment how how many people here have

1309
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,160
seen someone ever burn a flag

1310
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:12,240
by yeah just a crisis sweeping the

1311
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:14,880
nation isn't it

1312
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:17,640
yeah in a day when everyone wants the

1313
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,159
IRS off their backs they're working on a

1314
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,159
flag burning Amendment

1315
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:25,560
yeah I think they're trying to distract

1316
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:27,120
us you know cuz who's going to oppose a

1317
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,040
flag burning Amendment you might as well

01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:35,319
puppies yeah

1320
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,679

1321
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:40,319
to start putting flag burning

1322
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,600
criminals what we going do parole parole

1323
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,279
Charles

1324
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,960
Manson that'd be good for

1325
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:52,239
America right and then the strange thing

1326
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:55,199

1327
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:57,960

Cub Scout I I was raised very

1330
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:08,440
patriotically with uh total respect for

1331
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:11,000
the flag I would have never ever dreamed

1332
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:13,640
of burning a

1333
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,880
flag well until everyone started talking

1334
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,880
about

1335
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,520
it you shouldn't do that to an

1336
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,960
impressionable boy like me that thinks

1337
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,960
the government sucks and likes

1338
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,960
explosives

1339
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:34,080
oh you can cut the tension in the room

1340
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,279
with a B knife right now

1341
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,759
yeah would you guys actually get mad if

1342
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,719
I

1343
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,759
uh

1344
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,560
click well it's okay it's not even a

1345
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:47,239
really American flag there there there's

1346
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,239
only 49

1347
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,400
Stars yeah this is the official

1348
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:56,839
imitation Tim SLO burnable flag yeah

1349
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,839
made in China

1350
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:03,400
at 30 cents a week right yeah ra rather

1351
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,120
rather than um amend the uh Constitution

1352
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,880
to protect the flag I thought maybe we

1353
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,360
should just amend the flag to protect

1354
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,360
the Constitution

1355
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,400
yes because people think this needs

1356
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,199
protection it's it's something they hold

1357
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,960
sacred well I I've got something else in

1358
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,960
here that I hold

1359
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,040
sacred yeah

1360
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,239
this is the Bill of

1361
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,679
Rights how come no one's talking about

1362
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:36,800
an amendment to protect the fac of

1363
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:38,760
this well sure this is you know prettier

1364
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,360
it looks nicer in parades and doesn't

1365
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,360
require any

1366
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,960
reading you know maybe that's the

1367
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,360
problem maybe we should print this in

1368
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,560
red white and

1369
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,560
blue because you know this is just the

1370
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:56,000
school colors this is the

1371
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:57,800
diploma yes and this starts by saying

1372
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,120
that Congress shall pass no law

1373
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:03,679
prohibiting free exercise of religion

1374
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:03,679
well you know I'm sorry I'm a devout

1375
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:10,840
Anarchist My Religion requires me to

1376
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,840
burn a flag from time to

1377
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:16,199
time it's just a

1378
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,040
flag every tyranny has a flag some of

1379
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:21,560
them are the same colors as

1380
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:24,239
ours North Korea Chile and Cuba all fly

1381
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,360
the red white and blue the only

1382
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:29,320
difference is that we B ours up with

1383
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:31,280
this and this protects all speech no

1384
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:34,360
matter how offensive including the right

1385
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:36,040
to burn a flag the ironic thing is that

1386
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,080
what makes it an American flag is that

1387
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,840
you can burn it yeah it might stand for

1388
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,920
America but at one time it also stood

1389
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,800
for slavery and the Holocaust of the

1390
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,560
American Indian and the only reason why

1391
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,600
we were able to rise th above those

1392
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,840
injustices was because this gave us the

1393
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:55,560
ability to stand up in public and say

1394
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,960
all men are created equal and almost 80

1395
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,920
years ago thanks to the right to

1396
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,560
organize and the right to protest women

1397
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:04,679
were brought into that equality Club too

1398
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,360
yes yeah this might stand for America

1399
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:08,920
but this stands for

1400
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,040
Freedom this is the one men went to war

1401
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,600
for this is the one our fathers died for

1402
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,639
this is what makes this the greatest

1403
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,040
country on Earth and this I shall defend

1404
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:19,480
with my dying

1405
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,600
breath take your pick you can't have

1406
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,159
them

1407
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:27,120
both so connected are they that if you

1408
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:29,340
destroy this this goes along with it I

1409
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,120
