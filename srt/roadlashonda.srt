1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,759
all right I know this is late what the

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,360
do you guys do uh New Year's resolutions

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,120
is that to uh [ __ ] white people

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,320
for the listening audience of this I

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,720
don't usually uh although this year I

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,680
don't know I always say I'm gonna do

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,240
something I join a gym how's that for uh

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,400
corny white people's

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,599
[ __ ] um CU I'm too stationary I need to

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,480
[ __ ] move a little bit or my heart is

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,239
going to collapse in on itself

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,040
uh so I did join a gym We'll see if that

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,360
sticks so far so good

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,680
um but every year I kind of say I'm not

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
going to make a big resolution but I'm

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,800
going to do something kind of this I

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,000
decree to myself you know some sort of

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,199
[ __ ] old timey [ __ ] and so this year

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,719
I said I'm going to scale back a little

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:55,559
bit across the board uh meaning 130 to

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,239
150 dates on the road each year is

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,600
unsustainable when you're looking down

23
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,840
the barrel of 41 as I I am love doing

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,960
shows love being on the road but I need

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,200
to to scale back a little bit otherwise

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,240
uh I won't see 45 and so that's what I'm

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,840
doing for 2017 scaling back a little bit

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,680
which means across the board

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,520
so uh the road podcast is going to be

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
weekly instead of twice a week when I

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,119
first started this podcast people said

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
how often are you doing it h every

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,439
Tuesday and every Thursday and my

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,200
podcast pal said you are out of your

35
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,560
[ __ ]

36
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,799
gourd I was said no that seems feasible

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,920
uh it's not two podcasts a week is is

38
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,799
too much to just Wrangle and I don't

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,520
want the quality to start to

40
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,600
affect uh and also it's it's like I said

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,320
scaling back a slight bit and giving my

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,799
ever trusty uh producer Ryan Miller from

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,159
bleeding heart a little bit of a

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,159
breather as well Ryan's very

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,000
busy so as of this week it's going to be

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,159
every Tuesday instead of every Tuesday

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,799
and Thursday still plenty of content

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,640
still free so uh yeah not much room to

49
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,360
complain for free [ __ ] um but thank you

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,840
all for tuning in each and every week

51
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,239
and I I think one episode per week is

52
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,640
doable and uh reasonable and it will uh

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,480
give me a little bit more breathing

54
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,599
space so that's what we're

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,640

on either one of our ends always kind of

202
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,000
foiled it but tonight I I real I

actually feel really bad cuz you're cool

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,320

am excited like we recorded some stuff

209
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,800
in April but I wanted to get some more

210
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,880
so we're going to do this one as well

211
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,440
and then kind of compile all this stuff

212
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,360
together and make one badass album nice

213
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,040
and when I say tonight I mean in like 45

214
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,000
minutes from now right yeah about 45

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,880
minutes was the stuff you recorded in

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,480
April also at the Vita room or was it a

217
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,800
different room okay yeah Vita room so

218
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,200
it'll probably hopefully sound the same

219
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,839
yeah yeah we got good people uh is

220
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,959
Dustin working with it yeah okay yeah

221
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,760
Dustin's done a lot of stuff with the

222
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,279
aamal Comedy Festival and uh an

223
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,000
associate of stand up records I guess is

224
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,440
the best way to to dub him um no nerves

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,399
you seem cool common collected I'm good

226
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
you know I know all the material works

227
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,120
even the new stuff I wrote so I'm not

228
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,360
really worried well here's a question

229
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,519
cuz when I I filmed last summer and

230
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,000
there was like I'd say 20% of it that

231
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,160
was new and I was excited about and I

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,880
wanted to get it out there which may

233
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,920
have in retrospect been a dumb idea cuz

234
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,200
it may have been like 80% you know and

235
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,680
not all the way there are you how do you

236
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,000
juggle that are you like is there newer

237
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
stuff that you want to put on it cuz

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,519
like it might be a while before you film

239
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,040
again or well yeah cuz I I wrote two new

240
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,360
bits and I tried them out and I was like

241
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,000
you know what they're going on the album

242
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,040
like I like them I like having new stuff

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,399
it feels good in my mouth when I get to

244
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,600
say it like old stuff after a while

245
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,079
you're like uh yucky yeah for sure you

246
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,800
get uh I don't know it it just becomes a

247
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,640
Through the Motions type thing a little

248
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,079
bit yeah um so you are the reigning

249
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,720

tonight at all no um

289
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,680
so when I first heard of you you you

290
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,560
were in town what's what year did you

291
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,040
move to Austin uh I moved here March 1st

292
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,000
2004 okay so you beat me by about a year

293
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,000
I got here 2005 okay and I guess the

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,720
first time I didn't really start to it

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
stand up to 2008 but I was aware of you

296
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920
yeah that was when I started here okay

297
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
yeah so that that must be why then uh it

298
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,880
feels around the same time and somebody

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,399
I remember I know it was Joe stats or

300
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,360

into comedy then uh what made you move

426
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
from Detroit to Austin uh there was no

427
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,400
opportunities in Detroit at the time I

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,559
knew the city was going down after the

429
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,959
hip-hop mayor got caught up in some

430
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,840
[ __ ] then spent all the money on

431
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,400
hoes and fur coats and I was like I

432
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,240
gotta go and I had been looking at

433
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,120
Austin for two years actually and I was

434
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,160
like no time like the present broke up

435
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,960
with my high school sweetheart and then

436
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,080
like two months later I was here just

437
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,679
bounced I just bounced that's kind of

438
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,000
how we did it too my wife got a job

439
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,080
offer here and we're just like we want

440
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,760
to go somewhere that's warm and not New

441
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,720
York State as far as taxes and just

442
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,200
expense let's go there and we just moved

443
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,520
like we didn't know anybody here either

444
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,679
yeah yeah so it was just like I've been

445
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,640
here almost 13 years yeah yeah so so

446
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,840
what uh a lot of comics especially well

447
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,720
I guess in any City but I was going to

448
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:11,200
say especially in Austin like a lot of

449
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,200
the the most known ones have very

450
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,960
distinct personality kind of on and off

451
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,600
stage I think you know um what led you

452
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,640
to did you start hitting mics or like

453
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,159
what was the I think I want to try

454
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,559
comedy cuz you're obviously funny and

455
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,240
you're obviously a personality for lack

456
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,840
of a better term you know so I had moved

457
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,240
on to the next Hustle and I had a

458
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,320
magazine and nobody and Austin knew who

459
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,280
I was and I was like well I always kind

460
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,159
of wanted to try comedy maybe I could do

461
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,280
comedy and promote the magazine what

462
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,440
kind of magazine was it so it was called

463
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,919
it was a couple of them there was

464
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,960
virtual politics and then there was

465
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,200
Austin after dark which was about stuff

466
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,760
to do in Austin strictly after dark I

467
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,400
didn't know that was you I remember that

468
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,080
and yeah so it was fun it was a cool

469
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,039
concept that was why I moved here but I

470
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,520
couldn't get any businesses to take me

471
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,600
serious cuz I didn't have anything on

472
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,720
the internet I didn't have an internet

473
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,919
presence so I was like well I'll try

474
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,880
comedy for a bit and then I can meet

475
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,080
people that way and then I'll go ahead

476
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,039
and get with the magazine and then

477
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,360
comedy took off faster than the magazine

478
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,720
did so I got a bunch of equipment in my

479
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,120
house and

480
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,559
[ __ ] that's funny it's funny cuz I ran a

481
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,039
magazine also that's where the

482
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,840
altercation brand was altercation

483
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,880
magazine that's what it started as

484
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,320
that's um yeah magazines are tough all

485
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,080
around um where you remember the first

486
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,600

where it's like you know you want to get

508
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,039
out and then they give you a little bit

509
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,400
of something dangling in your face and

510
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:35,320
you like

511
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,880

512
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,080
mistress like that cuz there's certainly

513
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,520
times where it's like [ __ ] this and then

514
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,720
there's other exactly that where it's

515
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,919

comedians or is that two inside baseball

722
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,120
yeah we did that one um so it it's so

723
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,919
many of these stories it's really like

724
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,600
we're telling the same story every

725
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,559
show died young yeah it's like they

726
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,519
worked super hard to get to the point

727
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,320
where they finally excelled with their

728
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,559
career and then some they just got out

729
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,880
of control and then just ended up you

730
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,640
know just [ __ ] up burned out such a

731
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,720
unique interesting show cuz you combine

732
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,159
slides and you would really present it

733
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,279
like the work showed a lot uh and what

734
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,640
what kind of gave you the uh the spark

735
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,840
to to decide to do that show I did an

736
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,240
encyclopedia show I want to say in maybe

737
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,919
2010 and it was about uh serial killers

738
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,120
and I had to do the servant girl

739
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,600
Annihilator the what the servant girl

740
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,880
Annihilator murderer it was a it was a

741
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,760
dude in Austin in the 1800s who was like

742
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,679
murdering servant girls oh yeah he's the

743
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,279
the moon Towery guy right or was that I

744
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,120
confusing uh he would like come out with

745
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,880
an ax and Shop people in half so I had

746
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,440
to do that story and it was dark as hell

747
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,000
and they were expecting me to make that

748
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,519
[ __ ] funny

749
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,880
Jesus that's a tough nut to yeah and so

750
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,080
I was able to to take the really dark

751
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,000
stuff and make it fun and interesting

752
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,399
and educational and I was like I would

753
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,399
like to do a show an entire show of

754
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,720
biographies like this but with

755
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,080
celebrities right and so it took me like

756
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,279
I took two years to put it together like

757
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,200
do all the research SE and you know

758
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,640
figure out how I wanted to present it

759
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,840
and yeah yeah it was a rad show um the

760
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,960
the theater unfortunately like

761
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,240
everything good in Austin shut down

762
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,600
always pushed out yeah so we're still

763
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,039
trying to find a new spot um something

764
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,760
that's intimate enough that you know we

765
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:21,039
can do the show but nothing like bar

766
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,279
type stuff like it's not a bar show

767
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,039
right right yeah I would almost say kick

768
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,640
butt but that's almost in the middle of

769
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,640
you kind of want it darker in that

770
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,600
theery thing

771
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,919
