00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,759
hello and welcome to the season 2 finale

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,480
of modernday philosophers I'm your host

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,760
Danny LEL you're the listener that's

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,400
what you're doing anyway and the guest

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,920
today is Arty Lang one of my favorite

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,440
people to talk to and one of the

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,359
funniest people on the planet very

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,199
excited to have him on the show we

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,800
recorded this interview at his apartment

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,279
in Hoboken New Jersey Thanksgiving time

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,840
so I've been sitting on this one for a

12
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,119
while waiting to use it for the season

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,199
finale and I I thought it I think I

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,800
think you're really going to enjoy it

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,399
there's one question I I know I don't

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,200
have to point this out but I misspoke

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,399
when I asked it wasn't I said I was

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,079
wondering if addiction and desire were

19
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,480
the same thing of course that question

20
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,399
to me makes no sense but when I asked it

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,160
I said to myself I let already answer

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,680
and then I'll just cut it out but then

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,800
what he answered I thought was so

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,199
fascinating I just left the whole thing

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,640
in and I know I could have probably just

26
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,879
not said anything and maybe people

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,760
wouldn't have noticed but I just felt

28
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,960
like I as long as I put a question in

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,159
the doesn't make sense to me I have the

30
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,360
right to tell you so other than that I

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,920
think you know even including that I

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,400
think you're really going to enjoy this

00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,439

it's a beautiful view you got yeah it's

103
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,519
a lousy day we're sitting here on a day

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,280
of nor Easter supposed to hit or

105
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,759
something but uh yeah I got uh the whole

106
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,639
apartment's to view I'm wearing hobok

107
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,080
and in my place and I got a perfect view

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,199
of the so if you shut these Shades this

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,520
is like a $30,000 condo I think

110
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,440
Manhattan is I I've always felt this way

111
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,000
like the the city is is nicer the

112
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,639
farther away you get from it no I said

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,400
it to be I go you get to see New York

114
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,000
but you're not in it right I I live I

115
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,720
live in Hoboken but I work in New York I

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
think that's the best of both worlds you

117
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,960
know it really is when you're in New

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,000
York you really can't appreciate it cuz

119
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,600
you're in it you can't you can't see it

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,440
like the great pict you can see this is

121
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,960
like a postcard it is I really got lucky

122
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,120
with this I bought this place about 12

123
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,280
years ago and it it's uh right on the

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,759
water so I can't build in front of it I

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,000
love it it gets me up in the morning you

126
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,479
know we the depression I suffer from uh

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,800
a lot of times just gets me up and I'm

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,960
like all right let me get in the world

129
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,919
cuz it's not like I'm looking at St

130
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,919
Louis it's New York yeah it's like we're

131
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,320
the center of everything I'm inspired I

132
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,160
could live I would love to live like

133
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,400
this you know I my dream was always to

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,720
live in the Dakota you know oh okay like

135
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,280
since I was a kid I wanted to live in

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,360
cuz I figured cuz you heard about Lenin

137
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,479
or it's you know just cuz yeah and I I

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
always like to me like the Dakota has

139
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,720
got to be such a great like Yoko on a

140
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
watch her husband get murdered right in

141
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,520
front of her door there and she still

142
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,039
didn't move yeah it's

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,759
true it's good real estate that's how

144
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,360
great it is to live in the Dakota I

145
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,520
think if she saw her business manager

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,880
get killed right in front of the Dakota

147
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,880
she might have

148
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,479
moved she's like ah it's a shame but

149
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,360
yeah I mean I'm very cynical when it

150
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,639
comes to

151
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,600
Yoko yeah I don't know I me

152
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,960
guess I don't know I I guess I guess she

153
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,680
did love him I don't know I'm in the

154
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,440
other Camp I'm not I don't agree with

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,360
you there I've always well yeah that's a

156
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,960
better Camp to be in the Pro Yoko um Pro

157
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,759
Yoko yeah that's an odd Camp to be in

158
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,039
she was on the stern no he was on the

159
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,639
Stern Show uh he Paul mcar he was on the

160
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,039
Stern Show and uh Howard did this

161
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,840
hourlong interview with him right after

162
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,680
I got on the show in 2001 and he said

163
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,280
that he met Yoko first and he thought

164
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,720
she was just a crazy fan and as a joke

165
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,000
he sent her over to John Lenn flat as a

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,360
joke oh man and uh and uh 3 Days Later

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Lennon called him up and said I met this

168
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,720
girl I'm in love with and it was

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,800
yok jokes on you Paul sounds like it cuz

170
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,120
now Paul is dealing every every time

171
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,720
they got to sell something to doal

172
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,440
business she wasn't there when he wrote

173
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,880
Hey Jude but he's got to deal with her

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,759
yeah her face is right there in the

175
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,759
office yeah that's funny you know you

176
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,879
I'll tell you why I really like Yoko I

177
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,639
think she brought the best out in John

178
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,319
artistically like The Beatles all those

179
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
songs are great and they're and they're

180
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,000
catchy and they're and they're really

181
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,560
wonderful but if you listen to like

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,280
Double Fantasy and all those you know

183
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,599
post Beatles Lenin albums I think that's

184
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,800
where you really that's where JN starts

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,319
to really you know be an artist his solo

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,240
stuff is better than McCartney's that

187
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,440
that that I will say uh and uh I don't

188
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,080
know what Yoko has to do with that but

189
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,319
you're right she was there for it so mhm

190
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,720
you think it would have happened either

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,960
way I don't know I don't know you're

192
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,520
right I mean it's actually excellent I

193
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,599
mean uh ex excellent uh theory that you

194
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,919
know she was there for it so therefore

195
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,879
uh she's responsible for but uh you

196
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,440
know ballot of John and Yoko all those

197
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,800
stuff I mean you know he would had to

198
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,759
find some other words that maybe rhyme

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,039
with Elaine if there was an Elaine

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,919
there but I I think he would have I

201
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,639
think he could have done that but also

202
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,800
the fact that she everybody hated her I

203
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,000
think fueled him into doing great stuff

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,560
like yeah the rebel in them was like

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,840
[ __ ] you I'm Gonna Keep dating her yeah

206
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,319
if if he would have had another girl

207
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,120
that everybody was like oh you guys are

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,080
adorable yeah the [ __ ] is that well

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
Ringo Ringo got the hottest chick out of

210
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,720
all of them with Barbara Bach and uh you

211
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,599
know he just kind of spends his money

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,919
yeah I love Ringo when yeah Ringo is uh

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,080
he knew how to live he knows how to live

214
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,919
he's even cleaned up at the right time

215
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,639
you know he seems happy I well that

216
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,360
brings me to I'm reading your book and

217
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,120
it's excellent it's really really I love

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,200
I love the way you write and uh it's

219
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,760
it's well you got to go and get it I'm

220
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,200
going to tell you this is an honest true

221
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,440
plug for people out there appreciate it

222
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,800
um Crash and Burn and it's really really

223
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,880
great and you're talking in the book

224
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,839
about davel telling you about money

225
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,720
being an addiction right now I've never

226
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,839
I haven't hit yet you know I've been had

227
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,000
this 11 years but uh I'm still I've

228
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,920
still never had money you know right

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,120
right so for me I think a lot about the

230
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,920
difference in like what's what is life

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,200
with money versus what what is life

232
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,680
now and

233
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,760
well I I must say that the I've been

234
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,200
lucky I'm 46 years old the last time I

235
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,800
did an honest days work I was

236
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,079
26 uh and that's when I started making a

237
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,480
living from Show Business and then I

238
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,279
started making really good money when I

239
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,000
was 27 because I got on Mad TV the

240
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:33,320
sketch show on a network and I started

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
making about 10 grand a week and about

242
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,959
400 Grand a year and I never look back

243
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,680
and uh I'm not you know wealthy wealthy

244
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:46,240
but I have I I've I've you know I'm I'm

245
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,959
technically a millionaire I guess and

246
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,040
it's just it certainly doesn't buy

247
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,040
happiness it doesn't come close to that

248
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,920
but what it does is it just it just

249
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,680
makes sure that the little things in

250
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,680
life aren't going to take you out

251
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,000
depression

252
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,959
uh you know if you have no money and you

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,920
drop a bottle of ketchup that becomes a

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,480
billion times worse than if you have

255
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,120
money and you drop a bottle of ketchup

256
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,560
you know like I got no money and this

257
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,800
[ __ ] ketchup on the floor you know

258
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,399
you can add I got no money to every

259
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,200
single problem you have I got no money

260
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,800
in this traffic I got no money in this

261
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,560
[ __ ] you know my I do my laundry I

262
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,000
got no money and my broad left me you

263
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,480
know but uh it just takes one more thing

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
out of the bitching session that um

265
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,000
helps you very practically you know so

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,440
that's how it helps it it certainly

267
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,560
doesn't ensure any sort of happiness I

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,639
found you know you're talking about yeah

269
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,399
sure it it helps in terms of like you

270
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,480
don't have to worry about things it it

271
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,440
helps you in that way right but what

272
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,200
about just in terms of how you relate to

273
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,279
the world is it different having money

274
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,800
do you see the world differently do you

275
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:01,720
see yes yes I do I I I I must say I I um

276
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,480
it's not an elitist attitude it's like

277
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,600
you just when I see

278
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,160
somebody even somebody I know really

279
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,279
well struggling when they tell me a

280
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
story about how they they had to take

281
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,760
two Subways and this or that the other

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,880
thing to get to a certain place and

283
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,600
everything I really go thank God that's

284
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,040
not me anymore and I don't say it out

285
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,959
loud cuz that would be terrible but I I

286
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,360
go thank God I don't have to do that

287
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:31,240
right uh and uh I I I've I haven't had

288
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,279
to do it long enough it's to the it's as

289
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,360
if I grew up rich right I didn't grow up

290
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:39,880
rich at all I I had you know when I

291
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,680
started I had no money uh completely

292
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,120
broke my family was practically on

293
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,200
welfare as a matter of fact and uh I my

294
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,639
mother was toiling along as a secretary

295
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,240
and um we had zero less than zero and uh

296
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,800
I don't really remember that it's been

297
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,760
so long it's 20 years removed so it's as

298
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,160
if I grew up rich and so when I [ __ ] at

299
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,600
Rich Kids I'm almost the same way I'm

300
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,000
just a 46y old rich

301
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,440
kid I'm not an 18-year-old rich kid I'm

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,720
a 46y old rich kid and I uh I don't

303
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,600
remember really what it was like to to

304
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,920
take to not have enough money to buy

305
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,240
another

306
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,240
CD but I talk about

307
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,279
CDs I'm old enough to where that's my

308
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,199
problem I don't talk about downloading I

309
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,000
still talk about CD does it change how

310
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,000
you relate to an audience

311
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,120
uh it can and you have to watch yourself

312
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,040
you know I mean I don't have the kind of

313
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,120
money where

314
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,480
uh you know it's totally

315
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,480
unrelatable uh like uh I'm sure Seinfeld

316
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,079
has to catch himself at times when he's

317
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,440
in front of a crowd in Ohio and he's

318
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,920
talking about the fact that you know

319
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,480
this gig they wouldn't pay for the gas

320
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,040
and his private jet and stuff like that

321
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,120
but at the same time people you know who

322
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,519
don't have a lot of money like hearing

323
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,360
about people with money like watching

324
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,360
people with money that's been proven

325
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,800
look at the [ __ ] Kardashians I guess

326
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,040
people like watching that show just cuz

327
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,680
they're they're in some way living

328
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,560
through them or jealous of them or

329
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,199
whatever so maybe you know if an

330
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,279
observation's funny enough maybe he

331
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:21,480
could get away with it I uh no matter

332
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,320
I'm one of those guys where I don't know

333
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,199
if this is lucky for comedy or not no

334
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,720
matter how rich I get I will never seem

335
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,399
Rich I just and I don't do that on

336
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,360
purpose I'm not proud of it like oh you

337
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,519
know you're a guy who stayed real it's I

338
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,240
have no other choice you're just a blue

339
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,680
color guy I just don't know anything

340
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,000
else I wouldn't know how

341
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,399
to I didn't go to college I had to go to

342
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,120
summer school to get out of high school

343
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,800
I I would not know how to do anything

344
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,120
else or act like anything else I'm

345
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,639
really like you know Rodney Dangerfield

346
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,720
and easy money you know less money but

347
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,880
you know same type of guy well you're

348
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,480
also in a way staying true to yourself

349
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,040
you're not pretending I swear but that's

350
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,480
not the

351
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,360
reason it's just I I I I just cuz you

352
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,800
know even pretending it would be so I

353
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,000
wouldn't know how to do it I literally

354
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,120
would not know how to do it it's like

355
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,839
Chopsticks I've never bothered learning

356
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,560
how to use chopsticks and I hate when I

357
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,040
see somebody I grew up with use them I

358
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,000
hate it I'm like when the [ __ ] did you

359
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,680
learn how to use chopsticks and why

360
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,839
would you use them instead like if we go

361
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,920
eat sushi or something to get mad I

362
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,199
always ask for a fork I don't care what

363
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,600
the waiter what the look waiter gives me

364
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,360
I don't give a [ __ ] what some [ __ ]

365
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,079
[ __ ] at the next table who's got a

366
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,920
Chanel bag what look she gives me and I

367
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,480
don't care I'm embarrassed to people I

368
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,560
i' I've had women probably stop dating

369
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,639
me because I I asked for a fork because

370
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,800
it's it's so much easier to use a

371
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,320
[ __ ] Fork it's a [ __ ] Fork over

372
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,199
Chopsticks and the only reason you use

373
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,399
those Chopsticks is to seem like okay

374
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,440
now I'm more cultured now I'm more

375
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
cultured and I'm not willing to give up

376
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,720
the convenience of a fork to seem more

377
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,759
cultured I'm not to me just learning how

378
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,759
to use them is you're being a [ __ ]

379
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,639
dick you're standing your ground though

380
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:12,519
you're not you're not backing down no

381
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:14,519
yeah I I I uh yeah I I I just I hate and

382
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,800
and I get mad and then I should be

383
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,720
getting mad at them they're getting mad

384
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,720
at me and that makes me Furious I'm like

385
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,000
how [ __ ] dare you I'm the one who's

386
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,199
biting my tongue when I see you not use

387
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,720
the convenience of a fork and you're

388
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,680
trying to figure that thing out it makes

389
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,240
me sick you know what I think it pisses

390
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,519
you off when people are pretending

391
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,199
around you yeah yeah well it's a yeah

392
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,800
it's it's it's right exactly exactly I

393
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,399
feel like I have to get off my chest at

394
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,920
this point that I use chopsticks cuz

395
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,680
otherwise I'm just a phony don't worry

396
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,399
about it but I've been using them since

397
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,240
I was a kid yeah that's if you learned

398
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,800
as a kid I learned but believe me the

399
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,399
neighborhood I'm from no one was using

400
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,040
Chopsticks okay everybody had a fork

401
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,480
yeah uh you know we

402
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,639
had our fathers didn't bother to figure

403
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,079
out how to you know get a job much l you

404
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,399
was up staks going back to the idea of

405
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,759
money and

406
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,000
wealth now that you've been wealthy for

407
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,040
so long is there still any fear in you

408
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,120
that you could go back or do you feel

409
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,399
pretty secure and set in all right I've

410
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,560
I'm a made man now no I'm not that's the

411
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
other thing there other thing that's

412
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,519
crazy about me and the other Edge I live

413
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
on or other Cliff I always feel I'm

414
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,399
going to fall off of is no I I don't

415
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,920
have enough money to to where I like to

416
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,519
spend and live because now I've gotten

417
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,120
used to a

418
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,800
a certain amount of cash uh and uh and a

419
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,720
certain lifestyle like uh especially the

420
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,399
weight I'm at now I can't fly anything

421
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,199
but first class if I flew coach right

422
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:49,240
now would be I'd want to sue somebody I

423
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:52,440
think it's uh offensive it's it's it's

424
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,079
oppressive uh so uh and I like nice

425
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,759
hotels I you know I don't know I just I

426
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,600
I just got used to nicer hotels like a

427
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,720
Four Seasons or a rich G and a and uh I

428
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,880
certainly was never like that any hotel

429
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,079
was cool to

430
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:11,079
me uh but uh I I don't have enough money

431
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,400
to where I could stop working and I

432
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,959
really want to stop working you know but

433
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,919
CH yeah in a way but show business tells

434
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,799
you when you're

435
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,000
done it's not the other way around so

436
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,079
I'm worried that that day will come

437
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,959
where it says you're done and and uh I

438
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,880
run out of cash that would be awful

439
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,360
awful it's like that that line in match

440
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,640
point you know where the guy once he

441
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,280
shoots Scarlett Johansson he goes I've

442
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,000
just become accustomed to a certain way

443
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,120
of life exactly's willing to suffer to

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,520
to not suffer right exactly you uh yeah

445
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,760
and and that's what's great about a

446
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,559
movie like that and you know Woody Allen

447
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,320
does that a lot in his movies where

448
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,280
someone does

449
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,559
something some uh you know usually

450
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
someone you never think would do

451
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,960
something like that goes to a certain

452
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,679
level to to to keep living the way

453
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,840
they're living that's like a common

454
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,240
theme and you go [ __ ] I don't know if I

455
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,360
could totally judge that person it's

456
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,480
right it's the old woman that get you

457
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
it's like scarl Johanson maybe she kind

458
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,600
of knew what she was getting into but

459
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,520
when the old woman goes it's like whoo

460
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,400
he's gone to the dark side yeah I wonder

461
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,799
if it sometimes I look at it like when

462
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,520
I'm being lazy sometimes I wind up doing

463
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,120
a lot more work to be lazy than if I

464
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,200
would just not be lazy right yeah no

465
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,520
exactly it's like you know organized

466
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,200
crime people you see the amount of work

467
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,559
like like if I was an organized crime

468
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,640
the first day I put in that seemed like

469
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,679
a [ __ ] I would go guys I I thinking I'm

470
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,280
going to get a job like in construct

471
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,760
like legit construction I'm going to

472
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,320
learn to actually build a deck you still

473
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,480
be working for him right cuz I wouldn't

474
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,760
have this [ __ ] piano hanging over my

475
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,000
head or to drop of getting arrested or

476
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,840
you killing me right and it's a same

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,840
amount of work like the first day in

478
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,400
organ if I was in the mafia that it was

479
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,520
like wow this was a [ __ ] today i' I'd

480
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,280
go this doesn't make any sense this

481
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,360
should be a this should not be at all

482
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,000
stressful you know and I feel like we

483
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,440
that it's the same thing as a comic we

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
work really hard to not work oh yeah

485
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,679
well I think we're willing to put

486
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,320
ourselves through a bunch of stress like

487
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,000
that hour on stage is stressful and you

488
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,480
you start looking at every crowd even if

489
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,760
you're doing it forever and and you

490
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,080
start to panic and look at one guy or

491
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,240
one girl she's going to hate me she's

492
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,200
going to hate me you yeah at times yeah

493
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,880
and I'm like uh because you just want to

494
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,919
get a check and get out of there and

495
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,080
you're worried they're going to hate

496
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,760
this material and will the guy pay me

497
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,600
and you know I don't know uh yeah I

498
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,159
still go through that and it's really a

499
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,240
lot of stress that builds up in your

500
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:49,440
stomach to where you're like yeah uh I

501
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,840
don't want nine hours of a little stress

502
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,960
and LA but I'll take the one hour of it

503
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,679
a day or one hour a week you know that's

504
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
one of the things I find like really

505
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,240
fascinating about you also reading the

506
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,360
book

507
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,159
that story about the Playboy Mansion

508
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,720
yeah is to me Arty and to a lot of

509
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,799

on the planet like with that question

completely

513
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,280

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,039
convinced really I I guess I don't know

515
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,679
there there's times where

516
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,200

Wittier people I know but uh normally

534
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm disappointed in my performance as as

535
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,120
a funny person I don't know do you think

536
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,440
that's what makes you

537
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,440
great see I don't think I'm great so I

538
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,080
don't

539
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,559
know I don't know I mean true great do

540
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,760
you think it that's what makes great

541
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,400
artists in

542
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,360
general I I put it this way I've never

543
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,159
met one funny comic who thinks he's

544
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,520
funny M you know I think deep down you

545
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
know they know it but they don't they

546
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,480
don't really like ah that sucked this is

547
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,279
going to suck blah blah blah like if you

548
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,600
talk to dve tell you'd think he was like

549
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,640
uh an unfunny

550
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,559
dishwasher when he's really one of the

551
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
funniest guys who's ever lived you know

552
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,400
certainly of Our Generation but you know

553
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
he he hates himself and he hates what he

554
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,159
you know I was just talking to him last

555
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,640
night he feels like he hit a wall uh

556
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,360
Norm McDonald would get off stage I open

557
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,960
for Norm on the road Norm would get off

558
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,000
stage and say that suck this sucked and

559
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,799
I just watched them do you know an hour

560
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,600
and a half of some of the best standup I

561
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,600
ever saw you just don't I guess it

562
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,640
that's been a trait put it this way with

563
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,400
funny people I think I I you know I

564
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,760
think I'm the same way in a lot of ways

565
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,200
just I can't listen I put a CD out that

566
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,000
you were nice enough to let me promote

567
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,400
on your show and I can't listen to it I

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,880
just can't listen to it cuz it's too

569
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,880
painful I just keep thinking it it sucks

570
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,360
and then people write me and they say oh

571
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,840
I love it I love the CD and and I'm like

572
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,320
oh good yeah they love the good good but

573
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,000
if somebody else were to tell me oh this

574
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,799
suck then I'd be upset you know well

575
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,559
that's the problem with Twitter like the

576
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,440
your amount of like people that are on

577
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,039
there like some people even just to say

578
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,000
it are going to say something sucks and

579
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,559
that's why right for Comics that could

580
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,440
be deadly like that's all you're going

581
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,080
to focus on but uh uh yeah I'm the same

582
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,559
way I can't uh a matter of fact uh when

583
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,600
when my last Comedy Central special came

584
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,880
out uh I was in a a rehab that was also

585
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,520
mental institution it was like a

586
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,840
combination and there's a common area

587
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,679
where a TV is and Comedy Central was on

588
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,080
and I completely forgot and I had sold

589
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,120
it to Comedy Central so much had

590
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,840
happened in my life and we're watching

591
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,640
something on Comedy Central me and like

592
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,520
12 other people on the floor and it says

593
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,080
there's a picture of me doing standup a

594
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,159
clip and it goes coming up the world

595
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,520
premiere of Jack and Coke with Ry Lang

596
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,919
and they all looked at me like hey it's

597
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,760
your special I had no idea so I went to

598
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,600
my room and I said I can't watch watch

599
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,480
this especially in this situation I

600
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,480
can't watch it until I got up in that

601
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,880
robe that like your ass hangs out of and

602
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,080
I went I laid in my bed and you can't

603
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,760
lock your door and you got to be close

604
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,159
to the nurse station because they don't

605
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,520
want to make sure they want to make sure

606
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,880
you don't do anything and uh I overheard

607
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,159
like 15 lunatics laughing at my

608
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,960
special and I was happy they were

609
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,200
laughing but uh I would peek out every

610
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,720
once in a while and one guy was just

611
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,320
sitting there and shaking MH and I think

612
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,120
it was cuz he hadn't gotten his thorine

613
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,080
but but uh you know I'm like what's

614
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,600
what's that motherfucker's problem you

615
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,200
know and I I I couldn't bring myself to

616
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,080
watch and I said if I see even a second

617
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,679
of this just the clip they showed made

618
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,880
me want to throw up I never met Jerry

619
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,559
Seinfield but just from watching him in

620
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,279
interviews and stuff I feel like he's

621
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,520
the opposite of guys like you and me in

622
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,720
that way that he seems so confident in

623
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,200
his being funny and so yeah well when

624
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,840
you have that kind of success it's hard

625
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,919
not to seem that way you know uh

626
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,720
uh if uh you know if

627
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,600
you if if you're looking at a comedian

628
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,880
sitting there and he doesn't have a

629
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,320
smile on his face but he's wearing an

630
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,360
$8,000 sweater you go he seems confident

631
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,880
you know if they're dressed like me and

632
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,279
you were dressed like right now I think

633
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,600
they go oh wow that guy's depressed that

634
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:52,360
guy's suicidal this is no good no it

635
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,200
looks that's fine to me but I'm saying

636
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,760
other people might judge D I'm saying no

637
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,000
I don't judge but other people might I'm

638
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,799
not sensitive about it I'm not I figured

639
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,520
that but I uh yeah so I think he has his

640
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:07,480
dark times he just looks better you

641
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,120
know and when you go home and you see

642
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,200
the show that he helped create and is on

643
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,080
on for four straight hours it's hard to

644
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,520
think he's depressed yeah well you ready

645
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:21,200
to get into our philosopher here so Alex

646
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,880
picked out a guy for you also named Arty

647
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,799
I guess Arthur uh I have a hard time

648
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:32,679
pronouncing these names schopen Houser

649
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:34,640
Hower okay s c h o p n h a u e r and

650
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,279
Alex wrote Because of Art's new book

651
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,960
where he talks about attempting suicide

652
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,720
I picked an existential philosopher the

653
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,640
Arty Arty

654
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:48,159
combo so schopenhauer believes that life

655
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,799
is a blind striving meaning that the

656
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,679
only reason that it continues to exist

657
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,840
is because it feels it should human

658
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,480
morality is driven by desire desire is

659
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,120
directionless IR

660
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,080
and malignant and must therefore be

661
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,760
controlled with our duty to abstain from

662
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,440
Bad worldly pleasures and our duty to

663
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,760
our fellow

664
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,640
man I don't know if that's do you think

665
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,360
morality is driven by

666
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,360
desire

667
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,880
um

668
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,039
well it could me a couple of things you

669
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,320
know this is why philosophers to me

670
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,720
don't make any sense it's like listen to

671
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,039
a song it could mean something to them

672
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,480
and you have no idea what the [ __ ] it

673
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,159
mean like I list in a Moonlight Mile by

674
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,480
The Rolling Stones and that's a great

675
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,039
song but I don't know what the [ __ ] he's

676
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,840
talking about like you

677
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,120
know just another Moonlight Mile down

678
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,240
the road and you're sitting there going

679
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,000
I guess I know what that means but you

680
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,880
know I guess desire could be morality

681
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,399
could be driven by desire in the sense

682
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,799
that

683
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:54,960
um your desires could scare you so much

684
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:58,480
like what you really want deep down that

685
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,880
you uh you know they're bad and it's

686
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,480
it's the reason you you abstain from

687
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,600
them in a way I don't know uh or the

688
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,520
desire he's talking about might not be

689
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,120
like the dark desires we think of like

690
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,520
sexual or something but it could be the

691
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,640
desire to be good to be a good person

692
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,279
maybe that's what he means you know so

693
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,679
um I I think there's a couple angles

694
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,399
there I often wonder if desire and

695
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,600
addiction are the same

696
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,240
thing they're definitely related without

697
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,120
question you know I don't know if to

698
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:35,399
same thing no uh you could desire

699
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,240
something and even satisfy that desire

700
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:42,360
without being addicted to it happens all

701
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:44,080
the time uh but uh like they call people

702
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,200
sex addicts I don't know if that's real

703
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,320
like I have a desire to have sex a lot

704
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,399
and and I've at times even fulfilled

705
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,240
that desire but I don't think I'm

706
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,720
addicted to it I mean heroin is such a

707
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,279
physical addiction I mean the stuff I

708
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,679
was addicted to was such physically

709
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,200
addictive stuff that I mean there's no

710
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,240
one who

711
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,039
wouldn't I mean I think it's a small

712
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,039
percentage of people who if they tried

713
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:08,080
heroin for a couple straight days would

714
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:10,120
not become addicted to it you it's

715
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,159
almost impossible not

716
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,559
to that's why it's so scary you know

717
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,159
people ask about legalizing drugs like

718
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,720
uh they go I don't know we we should

719
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
legalize drugs the world would be the

720
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,840
same I'm like I don't know if I knew I

721
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,600

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,679
lights and some

723
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,679

perspective of reality is is changed

because you've been on drugs and you've

737
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,360
seen the world in a way that like I've

738
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,679
I've never seen I've never done heroin

739
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,480

742
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,720
personality at all if you've been

743
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,880

746
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,279
live with it you know but you know what

747
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,679
I watch like these uh Bill Hicks

748
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,480
documentary right where he's dropping

749
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
acid and it changes the way he sees the

750
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,200
world you know I'm so tempted as a comic

751
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
to be like man I want to I want to I

752
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,120
want to open my eyes to what they're

753
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,960
seeing like you know also like John

754
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,720
lennin and George Carlin these guys all

755
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,360
you know well Carlin has that famous

756
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,080
quote where he said the only drug that's

757
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,120
worth anything is weed he he did say he

758
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,919
used to write his act straight smoke

759
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,120
weed and then rewrite it it always got

760
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,640
funnier uh I don't know I would go with

761
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,720
the would sound like assd though I would

762
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,480
go with the odds you know most people

763
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,360
would drop assd even if they've been

764
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,840
creative at first it it it just makes

765
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,440
their lives worse worse I had a couple

766
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,640
of bad trips with it U at a Elton John

767
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,120
Eric Clapton concert at Chase stadium in

768
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,080
1992 I I dropped ass and I I was really

769
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,039
in bad shape like I was you know on the

770
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:17,039
top of of sha Stadium like looking down

771
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,159
thinking I could fly practically and

772
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,679
they had my buddies had to take me home

773
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:22,519
you know it didn't make me

774
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:26,760
funnier but you know you got those

775
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,799
stories like the Sid Barrett uh from the

776
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,679
the Pink Floyd you know getting badass

777
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,279
and and he was real creative it didn't

778
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,320
help him I don't know I guess it's it's

779
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,760
different for everybody but I think it

780
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,880
helps with music more than it would

781
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,039
comedy I think Hicks

782
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,960
uh Bill Hicks uh I I don't know I think

783
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,799
he would have been that funny anyway and

784
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,240
he would have had those thoughts anyway

785
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,840
you know I I do so you don't think drugs

786
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,440
opened your eyes up to a different kind

787
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,840
of world than the one I

788
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,600
see yes yes but I'm saying it's not

789
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,880
necessarily a better one and it's not

790
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,279
necessarily one that'll make you more

791
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,000
creative or funnier it's different

792
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,799
that's for sure but I don't know if it's

793
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,679
better what's the main

794
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,799
difference well uh why you think uh

795
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,720
creatively it might help his risk you're

796
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,760
you're willing to take a lot more risk

797
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,880
that's why you he these drummers talk

798
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,399
about being on smack that's why

799
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,159
musically it might be better uh like

800
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,000
Ginger Baker talks about heroin he's

801
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,760
like when you're on heroin you'll take

802
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,960
more risks Charlie Parker with jazz like

803
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,240
he he you know the only way to get

804
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,679
better was to risk something and

805
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,200
musically music has a better pace for

806
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,159
what you see when you're uh [ __ ] up

807
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,240
and uh and if you're on dope you don't

808
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,919
care so you'll risk something and in

809
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,399
that risk you might create something

810
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,200
amazing with the drums or the trumpet or

811
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:55,039
guitar you know uh but with

812
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,679
comedy uh it needs to be more

813
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,919
controlled you know it's it's it's fun

814
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,919
to take a risk but it can't be as as

815
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:07,200
crazy as

816
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,919
uh as music like like uh comedy is more

817
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,639
like baseball it's more like a baseball

818
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,120
skill it's more like you know all the

819
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:17,240
adrenaline in the world can't make

820
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,320
you better at baseball but it can help

821
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,600
you in basketball you like in basketball

822
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,399
you got a lot of you can win a game

823
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,039
through sheer adrenaline like I'm just

824
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,279
pumped up right now but baseball you got

825
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,399
to calm down and hit the ball and catch

826
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,760
the ball you got to it's more and that's

827
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,679
what comedy is and that's why I think

828
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:40,600
drugs could actually hurt it

829
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,600
um but I think with music it might help

830
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,000
comedians it can make you take risks and

831
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,760
make it way worse and make it just sound

832
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,039
stupid it's got to be more logical it's

833
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,639
more of a fine art you know well I'll

834
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,799
give you a little background on our guy

835
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:59,039
here he lived from 1788 to

836
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:02,880
1860 well that definitely is yeah you

837
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,080
know says a lot times are different yeah

838
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,919
Arthur

839
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,320
schopen was a German philosopher best

840
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:13,200
known for his book The World As will and

841
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,960
representation in which he claimed that

842
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,200
our world is driven by a continually

843
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,919
dissatisfied will well that's what

844
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,039
Carlin was always talking about sure

845
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,840
yeah yeah continually seeking

846
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,480
satisfaction and that's what you were

847
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,840
just saying a minute ago yeah you uh you

848
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,120
know it just never

849
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,240
happens it just it just never you never

850
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,600
get there you can never be satisfied you

851
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,760
could be temporarily satisfied now it

852
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,440
could yeah it could happen I like the

853
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,240
first time I tried ecstasy I'll never

854
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,840
forget that I I was like God they

855
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,880
perfected drugs every feeling you want

856
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,559
in one pill heroin coke and I walked

857
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,799
down the street I walked to Manhattan

858
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,240
like 40 blocks I hugged homeless guys I

859
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:56,480
was like hey buddy come here shake my

860
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,039
hand let's take a picture like you know

861
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,519
what and uh and I've been chasing that

862
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,840
High ever since never came back in a way

863
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,440
life's like that and if you've been

864
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,000
exposed to that once and you wake up

865
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,679
like if you've done heroin and you see

866
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,480
how high you can get from heroin how

867
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,760
great that feels waking up in the

868
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,359
morning and going oh my God this is

869
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,240
it I might feel a little better after a

870
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:20,000
shower but it's not going to be like I

871
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,159
was on heroin you know that's the same

872
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,599
thing as those

873
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,800
hotels exactly it's hard to go back

874
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,079
you're right it's hard that's the whole

875
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,679
thing it's hard to go back um he was

876
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,720
influenced by Eastern thought he

877
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,639
maintained that the truth was

878
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,919
recognized by the sages of India

879
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,919
consequently his solutions to suffering

880
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:44,079
were similar to those of verdic and

881
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:46,560
Buddhist thinkers his faith in

882
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,200
transcendental idealy I don't know what

883
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,800
that is I guess neither led him to

884
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,440
accept atheism and learn from Christian

885
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,680
philosophy what do you think do about

886
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:03,400
God and well you know I was brought up

887
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:05,720
Roman Catholic and I'm certainly at the

888
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,680
point where I think that's almost

889
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,200
complete

890
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,400
[ __ ] but

891
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,040
um uh I don't know I I I I think the

892
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,240
best argument for there being some sort

893
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,960
of higher power or something out there

894
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,680
that's bigger than us is you know how

895
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,800
the [ __ ] did we go from mud and sticks

896
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,320
to to the city I'm looking at right now

897
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,359
in New York I don't know how that

898
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,000
happened how does that happen without

899
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,240
some sort of guidance from a higher

900
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,480
being that we might even know is guiding

901
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,400
us

902
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,160
uh was there a Jesus maybe there was a

903
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,480
guy was he a Son of God I doubt

904
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,560
it what is God I have no idea but I just

905
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,800
know there might be something out

906
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,800
there that there's enough proof there

907
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,440
might be something out there to the

908
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,000
point where I'm scared [ __ ] of it put it

909
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,720
that way yeah yeah something scares me

910
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,280
do you ever

911
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,079
pray I have yeah

912
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,720
uh but only in horrible situations but I

913
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,359
have I to admit I have it and but in

914
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,720
really bad situations like you know

915
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,400
uh I was in jail I prayed every night in

916
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,720
jail I was in jail for a week uh you

917
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,599
know and uh I'm still uh I'm still an

918
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,160
ass virgin so that worked I guess I

919
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,880
don't know but I I I I don't know I it's

920
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,160
that that's a complicated question

921
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,319
obviously the people been trying to

922
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,560
figure out forever uh people far smarter

923
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,880
than me I don't know but I know there's

924
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,240
enough of proof here that I'm scared of

925
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,920
something else out there do you think we

926
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,599
have

927
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,200
souls yes absolutely but I believe they

928
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,839
could be taken

929
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,160
away I believe every kid has one that's

930
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,280
sort of pure for a while but I I believe

931
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,160
they can be taken away pretty

932
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,480
quickly most people have them taken away

933
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,440
you think you can get them

934
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,160
back not the whole thing

935
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,440
you can get a piece of it back not the

936
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,680
whole thing you're just never as you're

937
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,720
never as happy as you were when you were

938
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,200
8 years old just jumping around like an

939
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,480
idiot you know it's

940
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,720
like I think that's the original high

941
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,400
that we're all chasing oh God yeah yeah

942
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,720
I think Brian rean has a bit where he's

943
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,160
like you know you're six years old

944
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,560
you're jumping around the backyard

945
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,280
you're having fun then your mother goes

946
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,440
hey come here you got to stop doing that

947
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,720
you got to go to school and you go to

948
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,560
school and everything gets [ __ ] up and

949
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,839
like oh why don't can I just stand back

950
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,920
here and just keep jumping around like

951
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:29,920
an idiot oh you

952
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,520
can't it's so true right I always I

953
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,520
always said why don't you just let kids

954
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,839
be kids why do you have to let them work

955
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,119
later on or whatever it is and that goes

956
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,680
back to the money question eventually

957
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,760
everybody [ __ ] needs money that's why

958
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,680
you go to

959
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,000
school that's why you have to stop

960
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,400
jumping around because the backyard

961
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,640
you're jumping around didn't cost money

962
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,839
the clothes you're jumping around then

963
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,000
cost money when I keep jumping around

964
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,680
like an idiot you now some people can

965
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,800
like pish H never stopped jumping around

966
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,319
like an

967
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,040
idiot and everyone resents her for it

968
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:06,920
yeah I know it's like why be doing the

969
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,160
exact same [ __ ] thing maybe it's

970
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,359
jealousy maybe we of course it is of

971
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,520
course it is we all just want to jump

972
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,880
around like be way worse than her all

973
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,640
right at age 25 he published his

974
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,359
doctoral dissertation on the four-fold

975
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,920
root of the principle of sufficient

976
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:27,960
reason in which he exclaimed the four

977
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,680
distinct aspects of experience

978
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,560
in the phenomenal World consequently

979
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,599
he's been influential in the history of

980
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,520
phenomenology he has influenced many

981
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:43,599
thinkers including nii Wagner Ludwick

982
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,800
and then names a bunch of other ones and

983
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,839
that's it that's our that's our dude

984
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,200
yeah so uh do you want to read some

985
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,920
quotes from him and we'll see what we

986
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,319
make sure I think there's three here

987
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,400
that made me think of that Woody Allen

988
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:59,640
joke and crimes and misdemeanor nii this

989
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,760
nii who whose theory is we just going to

990
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,839
keep living the same life over and over

991
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,680
that's great that means you got to sit

992
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,560
through ice capades

993
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,200
again I love that that's true okay

994
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,000
here's a here's a quote from they tell

995
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,560
us that suicide is the greatest piece of

996
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,240
cowardice that suicide is wrong when it

997
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,440
is quite obvious that there is nothing

998
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,160
in the world to which Every Man Has a

999
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,760
more unsatiable title than to his own

1000
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,760
life and

1001
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,160
person I guess you know exactly right

1002
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,440
it's your life to to live and to take

1003
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,920
when you want though right yeah I guess

1004
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,119
why do you think people uh get mad at

1005
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,319
people for committing suicide or trying

1006
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,760
to commit suicide you think it has to do

1007
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:42,079
with taking risk because how it affects

1008
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,440
the people they

1009
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,760
love how it affects the people they love

1010
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,400
they say well how could you do that to

1011
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,960
the people you love it's a car I say

1012
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,160
look what I'm doing to them while I'm

1013
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,599
here my argument is it's going to be way

1014
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,480
worse if I stay here as far as I'm

1015
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,640
concerned I'm trying to help him out

1016
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,359
but death is death really why do people

1017
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,720
get more upset if you take it away than

1018
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,599
if you know it comes another another way

1019
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,960
because they the whole theory that life

1020
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,680
is so precious life is a precious gift

1021
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,000
you know talk to a crackhead [ __ ]

1022
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,480
himself in Thompson Square Park at 4 in

1023
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,839
the morning on a February night it's not

1024
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,640
a precious gift to that guy it's gone

1025
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,480
horribly wrong yeah you know do you

1026
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,400
value life more since your suicide

1027
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,760
attempt yeah sure but because I was was

1028
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,160
able to bounce back and and and I'm so

1029
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,839
lucky that my career came back and but

1030
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,800
you know without

1031
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,920
this ability to to make some money and

1032
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,079
to to have a career and do stuff that I

1033
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,599
like I don't know what I'd feel I don't

1034
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:46,119
know what I'd feel if I was a TGI

1035
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,760
Fridays right now waitering for being

1036
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,880
forced to sing Happy Birthday to some

1037
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,800
[ __ ] who just cuz he bought an extra

1038
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,480
piece of cheesecake I'd be I don't know

1039
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,480
what I'd be what what do you think is

1040
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,480
the greatest part of life

1041
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,800
I guess love I guess I guess the feeling

1042
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,720
that I if you actually have a connection

1043
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,920
with somebody and you feel my God I'm

1044
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,920
not

1045
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,599
alone the the rare feeling where you go

1046
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,200
I'm truly not

1047
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,920
alone and loneliness is a is a feeling

1048
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,520
that's that that happens more but that

1049
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,880
rare feeling where you go I have a

1050
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:26,200
connection with somebody and you

1051
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,920
know I'm not alone it doesn't have to be

1052
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,599
sexually it doesn't have to be woman or

1053
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,760
could be like a guy that you friends

1054
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,800
with you

1055
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,280
know usually abroad just connecting

1056
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,240
connecting with somebody

1057
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,720
MH uh all right man can do what he Wills

1058
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,720
but he cannot will what he

1059
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:51,680
Wills that's a tough

1060
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,680
one you can't I think it's saying you

1061
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,720
can't control your desire you can do

1062
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,280
what you desire but you can't control

1063
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,280
what you desire desire you desire what

1064
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,079
you desire in a way but I don't know if

1065
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,560
Will and desire are really the same yeah

1066
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:11,680
well it can be seems

1067
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:14,720
like I think you can't will something to

1068
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,800
happen but if it happens to happen you

1069
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,839
you're able to do it you're able to deal

1070
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,839
with it I think that's what it means

1071
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:24,520
that makes sense I have no

1072
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:26,720
idea nice one here compassion is the

1073
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,000
basis of morality that I completely

1074
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,599
agree with

1075
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,079
that I completely agree with if you have

1076
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,920
a if you have a lack of compassion you

1077
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,119
can't be a good person you have to have

1078
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,200
compassion you have to have guilt you

1079
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:44,839
have to

1080
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,839
have uh you

1081
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,210
know a feeling of

1082
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,200
of not wanting something to happen to

1083
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:57,319
[Music]

1084
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,720
you so you don't do it to somebody else

1085
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:03,119
and uh if you see it happening to

1086
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,800
somebody else you know you want to help

1087
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,240
them absolutely without compassion there

1088
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,079
would be morality wouldn't exist I agree

1089
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,480
with that you know what what do you

1090
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,280
think how do you define

1091
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,760
compassion like what makes someone very

1092
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,760
having guilt over something like

1093
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,839
um uh if

1094
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,319
uh if you if you

1095
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,000
see I don't know if you see a guy on the

1096
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:37,359
street you know and most New Yorkers are

1097
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,359
cynical if you see a guy begging for

1098
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,359
money and he's got all his arms and legs

1099
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,280
and he looks ample body like he could

1100
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:50,319
get a

1101
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:52,000
job I don't know if I'd be so fast to

1102
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,280
give that guy money but if I see a guy

1103
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,280
who's clearly has no

1104
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:02,599
legs I I I I what I do is I instead of

1105
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,839
giving a bunch of guys ones I save up

1106
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,640
and I might give that guy a 50 yeah I

1107
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:08,960
guess that's why Eddie Murphy did it in

1108
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,280
uh in trading places yeah but I believe

1109
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,960
me I checked there's no way they could

1110
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,760
totally hide that I I know the scene

1111
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,200
you're talking about yeah I I give it a

1112
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,520
full I give it a go round I go I just

1113
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,880
want to make sure lift up that one okay

1114
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,200
you check you lift them up I us I

1115
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,319
usually travel around with a the

1116
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,599
orthopedist and he just I just have this

1117
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:26,040
guy look at you real quick just to make

1118
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,200
sure allel this guys aren't Bo quick

1119
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,040
evaluation before I yeah I just got to

1120
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,440
get I'm going get a quick physical I

1121
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,680
travel with someone from the mail Clinic

1122
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,559
to give a quick physical no but if I I

1123
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,079
clearly have no legs I

1124
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,319
mean you go I guy's got no legs I do I

1125
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,559
have compassion for him so that's I

1126
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:48,680
think some people have the ability to go

1127
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:49,960
[ __ ] him yeah better better him than me

1128
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,760
let's say you had I don't have that in

1129
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,200
me better him than me I hate that let's

1130
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,880
say you had Seinfeld money what then

1131
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,880
would you keep producing the Way You Are

1132
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,720
no probably not no I I I I'm I'm too

1133
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,640
another terrible thing about my

1134
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,880
character is the laziness I'm just too

1135
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,480
lazy I'm too

1136
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,640
lazy uh if I had that kind of money I I

1137
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,000
don't know you're probably lazy based on

1138
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,319
your potential but you're not

1139
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,119
objectively lazy well I like I'm going

1140
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,440
to Cleveland this weekend to do a gig

1141
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,400
I'm doing a book signing I have an 8:

1142
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,160
a.m. flight the day after Thanksgiving

1143
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,079
to do a book signing for Friday that I'm

1144
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,319
in Cleveland Friday night doing whatever

1145
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,839
you do there with no gig and then

1146
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,319
Saturday night I have a gig in Cleveland

1147
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,200
come back Sunday basically giving up the

1148
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,240
whole Thanksgiving weekend that's not

1149
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:44,040
lazy you're working hard yeah but I

1150
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,640
wouldn't do that if I had sign for money

1151
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,359
right but you're still not lazy you're

1152
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,280
just saying you'd become lazy or or it's

1153
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:55,040
in you to be lazy you just don't have

1154
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:57,400
the option yeah yeah right I should be

1155
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,280
right that's true I should be walk the

1156
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,240
next weekend but I'm not I wonder if you

1157
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,800
cling on to like this quality of life

1158
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,440
thing as an excuse like you could go

1159
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,720
back you could scale it back and

1160
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,319
probably be just as happy but I wonder

1161
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,200
if you have to cling on to I must

1162
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:14,880
maintain these nice hotels these first

1163
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,640
class just to keep you motivated just to

1164
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,800
keep you working maybe maybe that's

1165
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,559
true so maybe if you had that money

1166
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,359
you'd find something else you'd be like

1167
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,400
oh I got to get to that Bill Gates level

1168
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:28,800
or whatever whatever it is maybe that's

1169
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,160
part of I guess I'm there now where I I

1170
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,640
should want to I do want to get to the

1171
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,599
next level but I just don't I don't know

1172
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,240
how to do it I I guess something's got

1173
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,240
to hit none of us know how to do I don't

1174
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,160
know how to get to the next level the

1175
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,880
that's the that's the tricky thing of it

1176
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,520
I guess that's the challenge right you

1177
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,800
know I always I thought about you know

1178
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,280
since Geraldo passed away I've thought

1179
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:54,119
about it a lot and I think the thing

1180
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,640
that this is just my theory but I think

1181
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,720
the thing that depressed him to the

1182
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,280
point that he didn't want to be here

1183
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,440
anymore was just the knowledge of his

1184
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,000
own potential because I

1185
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,559
think you think he committed suicide I

1186
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,800
think he committed suicide you do I do

1187
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:11,520
yeah from what I he from what I heard

1188
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,720
about it I thought maybe it was was

1189
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,319
actually an accident but you he could

1190
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,280
have I you know I mean it it was an

1191
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:19,000
accident a very avoidable accident for

1192
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,520
someone who was hellbent on living you

1193
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,480
know what I mean yeah if if he really

1194
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,720
wanted to be here I don't think that

1195
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,400
would have happened right well sometimes

1196
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,640
when you get tolerance to pills and you

1197
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,640
get the wrong

1198
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,319
kind it's not you're not getting the

1199
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,800
high you want from them and uh you keep

1200
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,599
taking them I don't know you're right

1201
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,240
but if you think him suicide I look I I

1202
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,200
think he I'm just pissed off in someone

1203
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,920
that funny doesn't leave a

1204
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,880
note you know the only people leave know

1205
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,000
are these awful unfunny

1206
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,880
bores I I wish you were with me right

1207
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,079

00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,160

to my job no more cuz they fired me you

1218
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,280

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,880
saying his though you just feel deprived

1220
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,680

1221
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,359
somebody L her like just roasted

1222
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,480
everybody in his life in the well we

1223
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:37,119

00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,319
wrote his that helped him on the roast

1225
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,160

1232
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:56,440

being in La the view is even more

1252
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:38,520
beautiful in away I think the farther

1253
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,040
you get away from it the more like you

1254
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,720
romanticize it and make it

1255
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,000

1256
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,960

whenever he's in New York he misses

1264
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,839
Europe and I I feel the same way about

1265
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,680
wherever I am I want to be the other

1266
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:09,000
place right she con state of

1267
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,799
sadness that's what that's what seeing

1268
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,599
both of those places achieved if I just

1269
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,359
