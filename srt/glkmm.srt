1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,720
being a parent changes you it just

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,879
changes you can't even talk I don't go

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,160
to the movies in the theaters anymore CU

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,280
it's like paying $12 to take a nap I

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
don't you I don't I don't I'm old I

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,120
can't it doesn't matter what you put up

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,480
on the screen you put me in a

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,480
comfortable chair in the dark for two

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
hours I'm out there's no good so I watch

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,800
movies at home with my kids which means

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,320
I watch all these goddamn cartoon movies

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,560
and and I find out even people without

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,600
kids adults watch these cartoon movies

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,920
that's weird like I I I watched Frozen

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,320
the other day because I love my

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,320
daughter and also because if you don't

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,520
know the story it's about a very

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,559
attractive but distant unavailable

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,719
emotionally frigid woman whose touch is

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,640
so cold it could freeze your heart and

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,960
kill you and I don't want to whip out a

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,359
picture of my wife but I thought I could

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,840
relate to the story

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,600
ah most you guys don't even [ __ ] know

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,600
her come on give

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,560
me anyway so I watched the movie Frozen

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,960
I was talking to this other guy who goes

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,560
oh yeah that movie Frozen I saw

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,560
it didn't really live up to my

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,240
expectations well now I imagine you know

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,240
how your parents

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,759
feel she like a 32-year-old guy being

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,520
pretty snarky and judgy about a cartoon

34
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,680
movie whose target audience is girls 6

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,240
to6 think maybe you want to move out of

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,040
your mom's basement and go see an

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,960
R-rated movie with some flesh and blood

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,320
boobies in it I think you owe it to the

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,320
family

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,799
name my point is as a parent my

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,880
expectations for a movie like Frozen

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,439
must be vastly different from his all I

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,200
expected for Frozen was to keep my kid's

44
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,240
mouth shut and out of my face for like

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,039
110 minutes and I got to tell you frozen

46
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,039
completely met all of my

47
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,560
expectations

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,200

basement bathroom if they can help it

a Sam peekin PA movie underneath our

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,319

92
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,799
family in the bathroom the worst one

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,319
believe it or not my my beautiful

94
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,400
seven-year-old daughter my angel and

95
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,720
she's perfect in almost every way uh but

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,040
there's something wrong with her cute

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,599
little derri

98
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,879
a because every time she sits down on

99
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:17,040
the toilet to make a BM that [ __ ] gets

100
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,919
everywhere every well not like up on the

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,040
wall she not slinging it like a monkey

102
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,720
but if it's made of porcelain it's fair

103
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,199
game to have crap all over it and in

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,880
places I didn't even think it was

105
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,960
possible to get it like on the underside

106
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,039
of the toilet

107
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,039
seat I'm asking could you guys do that I

108
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:41,080

109
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,479
gravity and Anatomy would conspire to

110
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,000
make that [ __ ]

111
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,000
impossible she doesn't like 40% of the

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,479
time on the Bowl along the

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,320
side on the

114
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,479
outside have any of you ever missed that

115
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,120

121
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,400
