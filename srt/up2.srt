from all over over the world and talk

94
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,759
about their lost phone their lost hat or

95
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,520
their lost umbrella it's not the

96
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
greatest job in the world like it's only

97
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,840
minimum wage so I had to supplement my

98
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,199
income somehow so I started a small

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,199
business where I sell phones hats and

100
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,199
umbrellas they're all refurbished so

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,120
it's you think that's easy but the

102
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,680
serial number on an umbrella is under

103
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,080
the handle so you have to peel the

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,199
handle off really rub it out put the

105
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,560
handle back on it's a lot of work but

106
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,199

true talk to me about your

183
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,319
Awards um well I won I won a couple of

184
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,680
contests and stuff like I won one

185
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,039
National contest that was like the

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,759
search for the next funniest queerest

187
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,400
comic who is funny is that what it's

188
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,159
called I don't remember sounds like

189
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,680
you're making that up well no I wasn't

190
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,720
it was like queerest funniest why didn't

191
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,840
we lead off with that that's incredible

192
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't know you want a national contest

193
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,639
yeah great that was fun I think what

194
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,919
helped me a lot is that I don't really

195
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,599
identify as a queer comic and I I feel

196
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,000
like I'm a comic that happens to be

197
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,839
queer so I don't like play to a queer

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,080
audience I play to everyone and I think

199
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,120
some of those Comics get stuck in plane

200
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,480
just to a queer audience and so there

201
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,519
their their stuff is more tailored

202
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,279
toward that which didn't suit them well

203
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,000
for that contest right do you know what

204
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm saying like I I I play to everyone

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,080
sometimes you go to the dog park I don't

206
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,040
know if you ever been there but the dogs

207
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,480
they like to hump that's what they do H

208
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,160
they call it twerking now I'm like

209
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,399
whatever dogs whatever I like to call it

210
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,320
the congal line cuz I like the classics

211
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,399

212
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,920

240
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,760

249
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,720

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,160

363
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,839
eyes wake up tomorrow you're cured it's

364
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,120
[ __ ] I tried that 20 years ago this

365
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,959
is my head then the one they really get

366
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,000
giggly about is the preparation

367
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,319
age that's what you do you put prep

368
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,920
operation h on your eyes and I guess

369
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:33,319
they're giggly cuz that's hemorrhoid

370
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,120
medication that you apply to your eyes

371
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,199
and that's silly in a normal person's

372
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,639
world but I'm like I don't know why

373
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,600
you're giggling it's just chemicals that

374
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,000
reduce swelling it's not prepackaged

375
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,199
with [ __ ] in it

376
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,720
you unless you told me like listen you

377
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,440
have to apply this to someone's

378
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,880
hemorrhoid then smear their rectum on

379
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,279
your ocular cavity then I'd be like God

380
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,199

398
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:38,839
dreams dreams like just like when you

399
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,399
sleep and you no that's you talking

400
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,720
about just when I fall asleep I don't go

401
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,680
into Rim sleep first of all okay I

402
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,560
twitch in my sleep yeah someone told me

403
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,440
that multiple people have told me that

404
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,399
and so I dream reality is basically what

405
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,720
I do now so whatever I'm worried about a

406
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,759
check being late an email not being

407
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,040
returned I dream that for seven or eight

408
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,519
hours and then I wake up and it's real

409
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,240
and I just carry that anger with me 24

410
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,799
hours a day sounds exhausting I don't

411
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,199
escape there are no fantasy dreams I

412
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,280
don't get any of that knowing that you

413
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,039
look great thank you not really with the

414
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,880
bags in them eyes but you'd think they'd

415
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,039
be worse you think

416
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,039
so I used to be a suicidal

417
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,480
alcoholic I used to be that's the way I

418
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,160
phrase it not really recovering suicidal

419
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,880
alcoholic I feel like that has more it

420
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,559
carries more weight and that's the way I

421
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,280
drink too I know you guys are having

422
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,520
drinks so I'm not going to be a killjoy

423
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,000
and I know you don't really want to hear

424
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,240
it but it's a big chunk of my life that

425
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,160
I have to explain I know people don't

426
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,520
want to hear your sobri I always go I'm

427
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,320
sober and they're like oh how long they

428
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,039
just strain it out like that they're

429
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,360
just [ __ ] exasperated but they always

430
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,600
feel the need to prove you know they

431
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,360
care about others that's all that is is

432
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,799
I don't but how long and I toy with him

433
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,559
I'm like well you know I've been sober

434
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,120
eight years now he's like muscle now

435
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,280
he's like well you're very strong then

436
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,039
they're like do you go to treatment or

437
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,960
meetings or anything I'm like no I never

438
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,799
have and they're like really I'm like

439
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,440
yeah you meant to say I'm the strongest

440
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,280
person but you know whatever I

441
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,760
understand it's difficult to approach a

442
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
champion that's how I do it because I

443
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,960
never went to recovery I never went to

444
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,919
rehab AA I don't know how that recovery

445
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
World works you know there's an AA

446
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,600
meeting across the street from my

447
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,679
apartment in New York because there's a

448
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,080
church there you know churches will take

449
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,360
pity on these AA groups they'll invite

450
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,080
them in they'll give them a little space

451
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,000
like this little banquet space give them

452
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,799
a little PA system let them sort their

453
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,039
[ __ ] out in the daytime I don't know if

454
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,120
you've ever seen a AA meeting let out

455
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,960
but it's a real problem in the community

456
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,000
all right because they don't disperse

457
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,600
they're not done meeting all right they

458
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,480
just [ __ ] flood out of the chapel

459
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,480
onto the sidewalk now there's a gaggle

460
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,559
of darix out front smoking crying or

461
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,760
[ __ ] comparing car wrecks whatever

462
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,919
people do at AA it brings my afternoon

463
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,520
down and they make a lot of goddamn

464
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,880
racket in front of my apartment while

465
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm trying to take my afternoon nap I

466
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,400
have to March over there every day in my

467
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,880
pajama pants and go excuse me fellas can

468
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,880
you keep it down the exception to the

469
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,080
rules trying to sleep over here huh I

470
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,720
mean would you would you like to get

471
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,480
coffee with me and see how a grown man

472
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,159
keeps his mouth shut and doesn't have to

473
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,240
throw a public pity

474
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,640
party that's how I stay sober by being a

475
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
dick and you got to respect it perfect

476
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,520
streak not one

477
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
relapse I have a lot of comedian friends

478
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,760
in AA of course because comedians are a

479
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,080
troubled sort like musicians they have a

480
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,080
lot of trouble so when I'm on the road

481
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,360
with like a comedian friends in AA I try

482
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,919
to respect their little program I was

483
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,640
with my buddy Clint in South Carolina

484
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,159
doing shows we're at the hotel and he's

485
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,280
worried about how to get to the AA

486
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,840
meeting and he's like I'm going to have

487
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,440
to catch a cab to this AA meeting and

488
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm like well you know I got my car but

489
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm not taking him cuz I I want to eat

490
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Chipotle and I like the hot sauce of

491
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,320
Chipotle but it upsets my stomach gives

492
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,000
me a little acid reflux I figure if I

493
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,960
drop him off first these depressing

494
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,400
characters in front of the chapel upsets

495
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,159
my stomach too early can't get to the

496
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,240
hot sauce I haven't started my PC

497
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,000
treatments I just think it'd be best

498
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,600
Clint if you caught a cab to your AA

499
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,400
meeting it's like a lesson on the way to

500
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,520
your lesson you know what I mean atone

501
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,840
for your transgressions you [ __ ]

502
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,120
heretic that's the way I talk to him and

503
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,559
anyway he goes to a meeting and then

504
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,720
some old man a agrees to get my ride

505
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,280
back to the hotel on the way back

506
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,919
through casual conversation the old man

507
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,440
finds out he's a comedian so of course

508
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,159
the old man's like hey if I bring my

509
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,320
wife to the show tonight is it a dirty

510
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,120
show and my buddy Clint's like yeah the

511
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,320
other comedian's quite dirty talking

512
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,400
about me just putting my [ __ ] out like

513
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,600
that like I just do an hour of sodomy

514
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,200
jokes but you know it's lazy promotion

515
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,120
on Clint's part but he's an addict he

516
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,000
doesn't have to form sentences his life

517
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,520
is [ __ ] falling apart and he can't

518
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,200
piece it together that's why he's in the

519
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,080
goddamn Chapel every day trying to make

520
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,640
amends anyway the old man hears this and

521
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,520
he's like oh the old man from a is like

522
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,760
I can't bring my wife to that if it's a

523
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,919
dirty show she'd hate that and I'm like

524
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,360
what old man you're an AA you did some

525
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,440
[ __ ] so I'm sure if your wife is cool

526
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,280
with spending the last 20 years writhing

527
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,840
around on the bathroom floor praying for

528
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,600
your contaminated Soul I'm sure she'll

529
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,080
be okay coming to hear an angel speak

530
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,240
you know get back in your goddamn

531
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,919
Cathedral and read your literature

532
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,400
repent through the pages of your leader

533
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,880
I don't know what you do I muscled up

534
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,720
and did it myself but you need to get in

535
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,279
there you need to get in there and show

536
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,960
some kind of goddamn

537
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:26,600
reverence before your liver blows

538
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,240

cuz you you from the way you talk on

581
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,640
stage you uh put everybody to shame I am

582
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,760
a I am proud that I did like original

583
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,080
work in my drinking days that I did some

584
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,960
really strange stuff my idea of drinking

585
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:07,520
was this is that life is truly boring

586
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,440
and when I drank I wanted the fantasy to

587
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,440
come alive but none of it ever lived up

588
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,919
to it none of it but I walked in a bar

589
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,840
and I go all right here's what the bar

590
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,679
is it's [ __ ] people talking about a a

591
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,440
football game or guys hitting on women

592
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,080
and then there'll be a fight there will

593
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,080
be vomit it's predictable it's old what

594
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,760
can what new things can I bring to this

595
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,279
what would I like to see as the audience

596
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,480
I always thought about that like walking

597
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,159
in a bar I would create something that

598
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,120
if I was a guy dancing with a girl I'd

599
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,320
go what the [ __ ] is this guy doing so

600
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,080
