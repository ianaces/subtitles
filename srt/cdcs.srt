2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,480

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,320
Spotlight yep Chad Daniels hi comic

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,279
Spotlight for for

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,599
myself it's pretty good intro hi

6
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,200
normally I don't dress like a uh

7
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,000
skateboarder going to a golf course but

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,360
uh I didn't know I was going to be doing

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,559
a set tonight how are

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,640
you I was at a bar one time and this guy

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,480
wanted to fight me but he looked at me

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,879
and he goes you probably fight like a

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:54,000
girl so I had sex with his best

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,000
friend because that is how girls

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,079
fight yeah that's right look around look

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,719
around find a man that isn't smiling

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,480
he's been cheated on look around go

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,480
ahead I'll give you a

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,479
second because girls think they use

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,960
vaginas they use their vaginas like it's

21
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,960
the hottest commodity on the earth and

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,680
it would be if only one of you had it

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,200
but you all have vaginas and some of you

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,280
are [ __ ] and that brings the value down

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,880
of the other

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,520
ones right when women are like if you

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,220
want some of this W don't you mow the

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,759
lawn cuz other girls have Apartments

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,000
[Laughter]

30
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,479
that's why they don't have to mow the

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,640
lawn there they have people that do that

32
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,840
for

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,159
them never made just don't hold your

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,320
vagina hostage because I don't negotiate

35
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,880
with

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,119
terrorists it's very American policy but

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,840
I stick with it I uh I started doing

38
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,759
standup a long time ago right here on

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,040
this stage and uh what happened was I

40
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,680
was working for Xerox The Copy Company

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,159
and was let go or fired and I got a

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,280
six-month severance package and I threw

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,640
myself a retirement party cuz I was 23 I

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,520
didn't need all that money right uh then

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
we came down here and some of my friends

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,000
signed me up for Open Mic without me

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,959
knowing about it that was my awesome

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,599
first experience with standup comedy so

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,720
uh not a lot of laughter and then I

50
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,400
thought well I know what I'll do I'll

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
just write some stuff and come back next

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,040
week and it'll be way better and so

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
that's what I did and then it was not

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
way better do you remember any of the

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,480
first

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:30,680
jokes uh yeah the first joke I ever told

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,440
was uh about a uh yeast c commercial was

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,440
a monat 7 commercial and this lady comes

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,400
out all cocky she's like hi I'm trying

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,200
monat 7 cuz I've tried all the other

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
store brands hey whoa whoa whoa whoa

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,400
whoa I think I was using both hands whoa

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,200
to make it dramatic whoa whoa whoa

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,560
probably yelling you know I can't

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,159
remember exactly how it goes but it ends

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
with if your puppy won't sit on your lap

67
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,319
anymore you have to go to the doctor so

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,239
that's that was my sensibility when I

69
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:00,040
started I was uh born and raised in

70
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,480
Fergus Falls Minnesota and spent 20

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,080
years the first 20 years of my life

72
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,519
trying to get out of that town and then

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,120
I had two kids and uh moved back just to

74
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,120
get them closer to home and watch them

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,040
uh try to get out I think was probably

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,440
my strategy there it's it's funny

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,120
because you listen to all my albums um

78
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,120
back to back and you can almost hear my

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,920
kids growing up I had someone from Acme

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,159
a crowd member come up to me after a

81
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,840
show last time I was here and they said

82
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,560
you know uh we started coming here 10

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,080
years ago so we feel like your son has

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,519
grown up in our family and so that was

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,519
kind of cool to

86
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,840
hear uh the album natural selection I

87
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,799
actually wanted to call it uh TI rabbit

88
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,280
or remote Miss um but then the guy

89
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,640
that's recording the album he was

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,599
listening to it and I say natural

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,360
selection on it twice and that's kind of

92
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,159
a theme throughout throughout the album

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,319
uh it's a lot about it's a lot of my

94
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,319
kids stuff you know it's crazy because

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,720
I called a Booker one time and they said

96
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,159
oh kids kill comedy careers and I have

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,599
to tell you I don't know if I'd still be

98
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
doing comedy if I didn't have kids

99
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,799
because a I get a lot of material about

100
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,959
them I love talking about them I love

101
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,720
talking about the struggles that come

102
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,120
with

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,519
parenting uh I found a my son is 14 and

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,199
he has his own bathroom and I found a

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,840
ruler in

106
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,960
there

107
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,280
and 15 minutes later when I was done

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,280
laughing I went to him and I knocked on

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
his door

110
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,320
and I said hey I found the ruler in your

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,120
bathroom and he's 14 so he responded

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,800
yeah but and then we what about I don't

113
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,680
where's mom can't breathe why are you

114
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,280
the last thing he said was I was doing

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,840
math while I was pooping that's the last

116
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,639
thing that he said to

117
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,880
me and I said 6X equal 36 what is X and

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,919
he goes what and I go you weren't

119
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,919
[ __ ] doing math don't lie to

120
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,919
me so he came upstairs a half hour later

121
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,280
and he goes hey Dad have you you ever

122
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,960
measured and I said I grew up with two

123
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,110
women of course I

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,880
have but not with a ruler like a [ __ ]

125
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:17,400
[Laughter]

126
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,880
hillbilly I laid down on my back and I

127
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,560
made a pencil mark on the door frame

128
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,560
like a goddamn

129
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,120
gentleman that way you can see your

130
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,160
progress and nobody finds your ruler

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520
like an [ __ ]

132
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,039
and he said is that why Grandma Karen

133
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,560
told me Smurfs live in her house and I

134
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,919
said probably but the album um made it

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
to number seven on the Billboard charts

136
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,120
and number two on iTunes and uh we're

137
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,440
all very happy about that Pandora I

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,360
don't know who likes me there but

139
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,319
someone does and they put me on all the

140
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,479
stations and so then people start are

141
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,720
starting stations of mine and I hand out

142
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,039
little cards that have the same picture

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,600
on it that the album cover is after my

144
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,680
shows um and people are always like oh

145
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,400
that's the album that comes up on

146
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,520
Pandora so it's it's uh it's getting a

147
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,520
lot of play and it's uh I'm happy about

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,560
it I recorded a special here about two

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,759
and a half years ago uh I listen I don't

150
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,840
do a lot of things first but I really do

151
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,840
feel like this special was uh the first

152
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,880
one to be shot in a club since probably

153
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,800
the 80s everyone was doing big theaters

154
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,759
and stuff I feel at home here I feel

155
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,080
very comfortable on the stage uh and it

156
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,720
was great you know I called it Asis

157
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,039
because um it really was what you were

158
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,000
getting when you came to a show it

159
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,720
wasn't you know you hear people all the

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,160
time that are on TV shows and then the

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,759
people that come to see them do comedy

162
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,440
are expecting that character and it's

163
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,000
not them uh so I wanted people that

164
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,319
watch that special to realize that if

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,440
you bought a ticket this is what you're

166
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,639

167
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,879

head I was goofing around um and just

00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,039
kind of having fun with it and the

170
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,199
