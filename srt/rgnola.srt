imagine like the Kool-Aid guy just

153
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,040
bursting through the wall of the

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,800
Jonestown

155
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,880
compound just dumping a box of rat

156
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,160
poison in his stupid Jug Head and

157
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,640
stirring it with a wooden spoon and then

158
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,240
trying to convince his flock to follow

159
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,360
him to the [ __ ] Crystal Skies of

160
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,440
whatever [ __ ] Messianic fever dream

161
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,560
he had and then he even drinks some

162
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,560
himself and then his legs buckle and he

163
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,000
shatters into a million reflective

164
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,680
pieces on the ground and then his soul

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,800
just sort of discc corporates and then

166
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,000
goes into that weird afterlife spiral

167
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,200
where it's shot into a hell of his own

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,040
making where he's just forced to burst

169
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,040
through wall after wall after wall after

170
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,200

192
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,000
in the [ __ ] New York Times about a

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,959
bunch of goth kids that are like just

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,240

195
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,360

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,000
[ __ ] goth

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,920

adorable but it's not very goth if you

202
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,079
think about it because goth the concept

203
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,839
of goth right is all about looking like

204
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,760
a dead person like you fell out of Tim

205
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,560

to the gym and getting healthy is all

208
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:28,440
about life it's about being alive and

209
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,639
like being flush and having color in

210
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,000
your skin and [ __ ] so it's it would be

211
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:40,560
way more goth to just get really [ __ ]

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,480

213
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,320
thing I want to get so many rolls of fat

214
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,639
that when I take off my Joy Division

215
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,279
shirt I still look like I'm wearing a

216
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,279

218
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,279
they were not cool in high school and we

219
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,880

220
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,880

221
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,760
[ __ ] God I [ __ ] hate comedy all right

uh I'm bipolar I think I don't know

224
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,279

225
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,160

depression junk food is bugles because

234
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,839
bugles are like little trumpets you use

235
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,279

screenwriters write these movies and

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,840
these movies take place in just a

349
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,960
ridiculous fictional reality where

350
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,559
there's just no social rules right like

351
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,679

352
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,120

353
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,400

368
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,919

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,840
matter cuz I'm a madeup construct of

379
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,679
capitalism in this Mad Men era of

380
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,640
marketing that is designed to take you

381
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,880
out of the moment and make you forget

382
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,320
about reality and things that actually

383
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,520

anyways do you guys like pop country

417
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,279
music yeah that's a it's a mixed review

418
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,559
it always is when I ask that question

419
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,480
some people say yes some people say no I

420
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:52,080
say if you say no that's okay I used to

421
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,840
be a hater too um I love pop country for

422
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,480
three reasons uh I listen to it every

423
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,159
day on the radio um I love it because

424
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,000
number one it's it's written by the

425
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,880
greatest songwriters of all time there's

426
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,960
at least 10 to 12 on every song um it's

427
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,880
played by the greatest players in the

428
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,360
world they're called Nashville cats been

429
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,720
playing since they

430
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120
babies

431
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,760
and number three it's dumb as [ __ ] I

432
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,159
listen to it every day it's what keeps

433
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,159
the gun in the drawer and

434
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:31,400

435
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:33,360

436
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,240
was listening to pop country radio and I

437
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,919

439
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,440

440
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,440

441
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,720
um he he ruined his career with drugs

442
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,039
and alcohol and not the typical route

443
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,080
not a broken bottle of Evan Williams and

444
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:58,880
a mound of cocaine he did a lot of LSD

445
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,120
and he fried his brain so much so the

446
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
last time they saw him in public he was

447
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,320
covered in blood and beaver nuggets

448
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,279
outside of a bues and um he's recorded a

to

605

00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,799
it's not that [ __ ] guy I know that

609
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,720
for shies I

610
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,440
uh I was hanging out after a show one

611
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,799
night just hanging out in front of the

612
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,720
venue and I see a guy approaching me

613
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,320
directly and I think to myself uh this

614
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,279
guy's going to compliment me on my set

615
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,080
and as he gets closer I see as an ition

616
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:34,000
t-shirt on has a big sequence cross on

617
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,600
it and I think to myself uh this guy is

618
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,559
probably not going to compliment me on

619
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,559
my set and he gets uh and he doesn't he

620
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,279
gets this close to my face and he says

621
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,519
that t-shirt joke I [ __ ] hated it

622
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:49,799
bro and what I said to him was totally

623
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,600
different than what I said to myself

624
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:53,279
what I said to him was uh I'm sorry man

625
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,799
I didn't mean to be hurtful it's just a

626
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,440
joke thanks for coming out to the show

627
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,240
but what I said to myself was I'm about

628
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,039
to give my ass kicked by a guy in a

629
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,039

653
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,519
child uh five or 6 years old is when I

654
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,919
first realized that I had it it would be

655
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,679
bedtime I would just stare into the

656
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,639
darkness of my ceiling my heart would

657
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:15,880
start pounding I would start sweating

658
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,600
really bad and I would have the same

659
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,000
thought over and over again and the

660
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,039
thought is what am I going to do when my

661
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,480
parents die that's going to be the worst

662
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,200
day of my life how am I going to handle

663
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,639
my parents dying they're the only thing

664
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,120
I know they're everything to me what am

665
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:29,639
I going to do when my parents die and

666
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,760
this would happen night after night

667
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:35,679
after night and uh now my parents are

668
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,120
both dead so needless to say that's a

669
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,120
huge weight that's been lifted off my

670
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,840
shoulders finally catch some [ __ ]

671
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:54,159
Z's I have evil inside me I have D I

672
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,320

673
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,480

stores I started shopping at grocery

678
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,080
stores here's the weird thing about some

679
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,519
grocery stores is that they make you

680
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,919
feel like you're evil even though you're

681
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,480
not because they're the only place on

682
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,480
the planet Earth that requires you a

683
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,679
check out to say no I don't want to help

684
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,679
kids with muscular distrophy

685
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,000
they make you say it too you think you

686
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,240
can politely Decline and didn't know on

687
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
the ATM but then the clerk looks at you

688
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,279
and they're like don't you want to help

689
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,559
the kids and then you have to be like uh

690
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:41,360
[ __ ] I guess I don't that's

691
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,120
weird I don't even know myself

692
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,440
anymore and then they might say

693
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,679
something like this I might be like uh

694
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,159

766
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,240
the phone

767
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:49,280

768
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,140
good name taking that tone with me the

769
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:57,810
man's a miracle worker

770
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:57,810
[Laughter]

771
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,599
people always tell me uh I should lose

772
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,040
weight which is fine they're really

773
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,240
telling me I should live

774
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,680
longer which is stupid because I worked

775
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,079
in an old age home and I know how that

776
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,760
ends there's no trophy at the end of

777
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,079
that

778
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,040
race but one people give me different

779
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:20,000
advice one person said every time you

780
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,680
eat a burger it takes 6 minutes off your

781
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,920
life and uh I heard that and I I went

782
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,520
home and I threw away all my

783
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,040
socks because I calculated I eat about

784
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,839
four Burgers a

785
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,200
month I went to Costco I got a 60 pack

786
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,640
of socks where they all had the same

787
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,240
matching patterns cuz I figured out it

788
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,720
takes me about 30 minutes a month to

789
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,680
pair my

790
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,560
socks so I gained six minutes a month on

791
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,520
my

792
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,520
life without giving up any

793
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,200
Burgers I'm living like an

794
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,720

795
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,560
which is exciting thank you it's very

796
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,440
good because I wasn't the kind of guy

797
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,200

798
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,839
easily before this you know I locked one

799
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,359

up but then everybody there had these

806
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:28,000

alcoholic so every week in between

832
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,079
meetings I just get wasted as much as I

833
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,960

834
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,319
for the week coming

835
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,720
up I remember one night I got so

836
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:38,839
plastered I'm walking through Times

837
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,079
Square in New York City there's a uh hot

838
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,440
dog stand that one of those carts the

839
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,160
guy who's Manning it must have walked

840
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,200
away from the cart he was doing

841
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,880
something else and I was so hammered

842
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,839
that I just staggered and fell into the

843
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,000
cart and the cart fell on top of me and

844
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,839
all this nasty hot dog water that had

845
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,680
been sitting there all day this slimy

846
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,160
disgusting smelly water got all over me

847
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,800
and I kept trying to get up but I was

848
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,359
too drunk and I kept slipping on the

849
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,599
greasy water then I started vomiting all

850
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,079
over myself because of the smell and

851
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,800
then just for a second I remember

852
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,220
smiling thinking this is going to kill

853
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:17,930

00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,880
about white people I don't want this to

893
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,000
happen so I'm like I'm going to really

894
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,800

895
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,480
elevator gets to the floor we're both on

896
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,839
the the same floor on the third floor

897
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,160

898
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,560

still taking the flipflops off and she's

905
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,160
