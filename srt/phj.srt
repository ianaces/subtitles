1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,839
I just like to say that there is a

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,359
jaguar in this [ __ ] Resort Village

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,719
and No One Believes Me and I don't know

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,200
if it's because you people are drinking

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,880
too much but I have a lucid mind and

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,719
Clear Eyes there is a jaguar panther in

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,920
this [ __ ] jungle she's nodding yes

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,920
you've seen this cat no one's concerned

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,720
no one is concerned about this wild cat

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,960
as we ride around on golf carts that's

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,679
open air and then all the restaurants

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,640
are open air so you can just turn your

13
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,439
back to the [ __ ] jungle and eat eggs

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,719
and hope that your head's not taken off

15
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,120
at 2:00 p.m. well I'm sorry I'm not

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,440

it 20 years ago it doesn't work and the

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,079
one you get giggly about is preparation

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,040
AG that's what you

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,439
do you put Preparation H in your eyes

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,799
and and I guess they're giggling cuz

54
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,280
that's hemorrhoid medication that you

55
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,600
apply to your eyes and that's silly and

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,000
a normal person 's World somehow I'm

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,840
like it why are you giggling it's just

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,440
chemicals that reduce swelling it's not

59
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,239
prepackaged with [ __ ] in it do you

60
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,520

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,879
listen you have to apply this to

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,879
someone's hemorrhoid then smear their

63
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,800
rectum on your ocular cavity I'm like

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,519
God damn it your home remedies are a tad

65
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,440
bit extreme if there is a plastic

66
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,720
surgeon that works pro bono I will take

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,200

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,200
tired head
