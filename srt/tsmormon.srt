1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,560
Mormons get sent to hell for drinking

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,320
coffee yeah cuz caffeine's a drug if

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,840
you're a Mormon it's a sin to drink

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,799
coffee it's kind of funny if you think

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,799
about it to a Mormon a thermos is drug

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,800
paraphernalia that's a caffeine

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,960
ball an espresso machine is kind of like

8
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,960
a free base unit

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
I love the Mormons though cuz they bring

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,079
it door

11
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,960
too there's nothing I like better than

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,600
seeing a couple of white shirts and ties

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,120
get off their bicycle in front of the

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,120
slle

15
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,399
compound cuz I know that they're going

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,840
to spend the rest of the afternoon

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,920
trying to convince me that that Joseph

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,280
Smith found truth in the bottom of his

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
hatch

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm going to try to convince them that I

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,960
found it at the bottom of a bottle of

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,960
Jim

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,960
Beam cuz I'll listen I love to hear

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,040
people try to convince me that their

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,680
religion is the true one cuz you never

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,560
know somebody might they might have it

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,360
right I was actually watching a

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,040
televangelist and he actually was

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,799
talking about the scripture being a

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,119
prophecy versus a coincidence he said

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,360
those odds were

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,399
calculated and do you know what the odds

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:37,240
are of the scripture being a pure

34
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:40,000
coincidence a 100 million billion to

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,720
one okay here's a little hint for all

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,240
you upand cominging tele

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,799
evangelists if you're going to lie to me

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,799
use a real goddamn

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,479
number a 100 million billion is not a

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,280
real

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,479
number a 100 million billion is an

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,399
amount of money a fifth grader bets

43
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,399
another fifth grader to jump off the

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,440
roof it's like a$0 zillion

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,120
dollar it's one of those numbers that

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,560
people make up just when they want to

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,599
you know when they want to say it's

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,040
large and they don't know like like my
