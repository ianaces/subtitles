everything and and you hear him one of

184
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,240
my favorite cuts of all theirs is the

185
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,039
intro and the outro you listen to that I

186
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,759
have not and you mentioned it and I just

187
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,400
read about it it's so magnificent

188
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,319
because it's all it is from start to

189
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,639
finish is uh introductions of the band

190
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,800
members and there's everyone from Roy

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,240
Rogers on trigger to count B Bassy and

192
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,319
his orchestra on triangle you know and

193
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,280

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,680
on ukulele and oh that's wild Eric you

195
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,000
know it's this real wait a minute now I

196
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,720
think I might have heard

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,319
cuz I mean in the early days of being of

198
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,759
thinking it was okay to steal MP3s I

199
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,360
stole a lot of bonso dog stuff and so

200
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,159
but then I lost it so I know I've heard

201
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,599
that now there's Instant Karma for you

202
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,400
for stealing yeah believe me believe me

203
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,479
but now I mean what do you you got to

204
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,000
you can find them in the used record bin

205
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,639

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,960

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,160
farmh and uh it's basically uh just a

219
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,279

288
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,839
day and he would have his robots on

289
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,480
stage just doing their strange things

290
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,360
and uh it's their avangard music and you

291
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,240
know most of the hippies back then were

292
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,720
probably really Stoner on acid and it

293
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,160
was just perfect for them yeah what the

294
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,160
[ __ ] am I see watching

295
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,360
it uh twist the brain and and you know

296
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,760
the the renaissance fair that I spoke

297
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
about where I learned about the bonso

298
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,720
there was was pretty big drug culture so

299
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,240
it was perfect for those guys to be

300
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,399
discovering bonso dog ban because the

301
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,120
the renfair is very Anglo Centric sure

302
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,440
and uh you know here in the states for

303
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,399
the hippies and comedy it was fire sign

304
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,959
theater sure Dave Osman came out of the

305
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,800
early Renaissance Fairs yeah you said

306
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:54,440
that that's interesting Phil Proctor was

307
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,959
around then and uh the the uh so the

308
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,000
natural kind of progression since it was

309
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,160
Elizabeth in England is after hours well

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,600
let's get some contemporary English fun

311
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,079
in here and uh you know Beyond The

312
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,920
Fringe and other English humor was you

313
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,959
know was good but it seemed to a little

314
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,199
too conservative whereas these guys were

315
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,120
hippies and irreverent yeah so it made

316
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:17,519
sense it all in the equation what's

317
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,839
crazy is later today I'm going to be

318
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,680
talking about some of the more

319
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,000
conservative English music and even

320
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,399
maybe some of the more State English

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,560
comedy with the album we picked this is

322
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,240
a perfect um position thank you there's

323
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,959
the word that I couldn't think of or is

324
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,680
it just a position just here's one

325
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,959
there's one there's a nice gesture and

326
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,079
listening to it I was just like well

327
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,279
first of all you telling me that I'm

328
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,920
like that's just amazing that they might

329
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,720
have been hurting nerd's brains just a

330
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,800
little bit before Monty Python that they

331
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:52,079
might have just been needling our brains

332
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,040
before well if you were like a liberal

333
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,519
or

334
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,600
Democratic or or uh rebelling

335
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,279
conservative teen in the mid to late 60s

336
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,920
you know and the flower power was coming

337
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,160
on and the hippie movement was evolving

338
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,839
or you stayed in your bedroom until you

339
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,440
were old enough to run away from home

340
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,519
and become emancipated I you were

341
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,279
probably dropping acid or getting stoned

342
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,320
you know on the sly and you had you know

343
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,560

346
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,320
Frank zpp and the mothers were in my

347
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,839
opinion doing sort of like what the bons

348
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,199

349
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,240
St side where they were just freaking

350
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:36,320
out being very creative with this

351
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,920
improvisational Jazz stuff that Frank

352
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,279
was leading them in and and it's really

353
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,440
you know we're only in it for the money

354
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,440

356
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,680
and if you are were buzzed and listening

357
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,600
to it or late at night you know looking

358
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,680
for entertainment where you didn't have

359
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,120
to go to mainstream television and watch

360
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,480
The Beverly Hillbillies or uh you know

361
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,360

362
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,279
English kids Lonzo dog band for the

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,399
American Kids the Frank Za and the mo

364
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,120
mothers and I don't know this is I'm

365
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,000
just kind of figuring it all out and

366
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,959
retrospect well it's crazy too that

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,160
these guys were the connection between

368
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,079
the Beatles and Monty Python essentially

369
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,440
too because Urban Spaceman which is

370
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,560
probably the first bonso song I ever

371
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,160
heard and loved it didn't get it because

372
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,600
I was a little too young to get it I

373
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,199
think I still don't think I entirely get

374
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,560
it but that was half produced by Paul

375
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,639
McCartney because he liked the Bonzo dog

376
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,160
band right and then George Harrison

377
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,680
connected with mon Python and producing

378
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,240
their films and then it all comes

379
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,720
together in Rutland weekend television

380
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
it's just like this just it's very

381
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,040
incestuous but like three wonderful

382
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,920
things that are like I guess making love

383
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,600
that's gross um but you know what I'm

384
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
saying you you get my point as said love

385
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
fast it's all relative and the whole

386
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,680
time I'm listening to this I'm like wait

387
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,399
did you get that it's inest it's all Rel

388
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,079
come back up I should have given it more

389
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,160
credit than I did the listening to it

390
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,120
I'm like okay so was new vaille bandn

391
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
before or after and I did not know that

392
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,759
they're basically about the the same

393
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,000
time and that they almost became the new

394
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,040
vaille band but then the new vaille band

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,839
apparently stole their entire look and

396
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,600
their all the like the design of their

397
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,480
oh I didn't realize it yeah I just had

398
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,440
read that so the guy who who who who

399
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,839
made the new volb band album with

400
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,319
session session musicians apparently

401
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,680
came to Neil L and the rest of them said

402
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,600
would you guys like to perform when they

403
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,959
said no he stole their look and then

404
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,199
just put together another well it's it's

405
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,079
a compliment you know there's always Ste

406
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,959
imitation is a form of flattery yeah

407
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,440
that's what it is steal from the greats

408
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,680
that's what you find

409
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,440
and so were new vodvil band were they

410
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,680
the ones that did wi C the whole album

411
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,560
is that though boy there's no variety

412
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,600
stop holding your nose and singing

413
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:46,959
exactly that's all

414
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:50,040
yes but what uh the bonso did though I

415
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,040
grew up very much uh you know kind of

416
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,319
writing on my parents' tastes and they

417
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,160
had besides Herb Albert and uh you know

418
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,920
The Singing Nun and things like this you

419
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,000
know growing up they also had uh the

420
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,799
firehouse 5 dixyland band and if you

421
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,760

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,000
hello Central give me Dr Jazz with a

423
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,919
more wacka whacka kind of feel to it

424
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,880
right and so I was like oh well I know

425
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,600
this music already that's perfect yeah

426
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
it was It was kind of cool fun so it's

427
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,679
kind of conservative you know respecting

428
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,280
our elders sure but then breaking ground

429
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,079
new territory rock and roll because they

430
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,480

was terribly tortured and really had a

435
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,640
bad end Etc but uh but you know a lot of

436
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,120
Genius said Barrett with Pink Floyd you

445
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,400
okay so you did mention earlier and I

446
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,159
didn't want to let this go that your

447
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,679
father had a club so yeah nightclub

448
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,440
Comedy Club both what are we talking

449
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:17,280
about uh it was a sort of a private

450
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:20,480
gambling Club really yeah uh uh if he

451
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,880
had either co-owned or managed various

452
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,720
clubs the LA City Club he had his own

453
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,280
club on Santa Monica in West Hollywood

454
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,600
at lanica called The Regency and then up

455
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,280
on the Sunset Strip the boy which later

456
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,840
became the Cavendish West which I think

457
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,360
is still extant uh up on the strip and

458
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,919
he was co-owners uh with Lauren Green

459
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,559
really on that one or one of the others

460
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,480
and then uh when I was a kid I'd go

461
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,760
visit the club and I remember I got

462
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,320
kidnapped once by czecho Marx's

463
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,799
Widow hid under the table for hours they

464
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,760
didn't know where little Jeffrey was um

465
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:59,520
and I I would meet Omar Sharif uh Don

466
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,559
Adams you know a lot of you know Stars

467
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,039
would go and sure play bridge or back

468
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,120
Amon and yeah and you know one time I

469
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,440
think the club got raided by the da his

470
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,799
the da Bert Bert Pines Mom Ruth Pines

471
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,919
was part of the gang that got arrested

472
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,360
so you know everyone got released and

473
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,200
all the charges dropped cuz the DA's

474
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,559
mother was part of the uh the Patty

475
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,720
Wagon Gang anyway so they you know it

476
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,080
was u a business that he got in and my

477
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,480
dad was always trying to get out of that

478
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,480
business uh because of seeing actors

479
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,120
drinking gambling and all he didn't want

480
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,440
me to become an actor at all yeah yeah

481
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,520
yeah and and he would ask he came home

482
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,760
one day and said Jeffrey uh I asked Don

483
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,080
Adams some advice for you since you say

484
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,559
you want to be an actor and and he said

485
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:54,760
w-e tell him to forget about it it's a

486
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,280
90% luck and 10% of you know talent and

487
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,159
who you know you know whatever yeah yeah

488
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,440
yeah and uh so this

489
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,520
needless to say I I I couldn't get

490
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,000
acting out of my system and I continued

491
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,200
and and I became very proud first of my

492
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
dad for going back to school and getting

493
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,919
his Masters in Psychology and becoming

494
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,320
PS a psychologist and and then he became

495
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,520
very proud of me when he saw my name and

496
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,400
the first movie I co-starred in I think

497
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,600
Twilight Zone movie with John Lithgow on

498
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,320
uh George Miller's segment and then

499
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,720
other films and so then later in his

500
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,720
life he became a drama therapist as well

501
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,520
really and I'd go down and Coach him you

502
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,000
improvisation and and his scene work and

503
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,960
he would take uh drama therapy and

504
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,640
Shakespeare and and Theater into

505
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,280
jails and help treat inmates you know

506
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,120
rehabing them with Arts with the

507
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
dramatic arts and such well I think he

508
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,880
only got caught in one or two lockdowns

509
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,960
that's good that's good that's a good

510
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,919
record oh my God that's fascinating to

511
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,200
me hey I've been fascinated too I had a

512
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,880
righted here on the arm I scratched and

513
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,039
got

514
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,520
infected so the uh I guess the

515
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:07,559
introduction to Comedy on vinyl came I

516
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,960
guess through my dad uh he not only had

517
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:13,240
comedians play at his clubs and such but

518
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,640
uh he would regil me with with stories

519
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,600
of going to see uh uh what's his name uh

520
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,960
wab buy a duck uh Joe B not Joe besser

521
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,360

00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:25,400
out I'm all about

544
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,210
[Applause]

545
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,399
[Music]

546
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,520
I wake up every morning with a smile

547
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:47,559
upon my face my natural exuberance

548
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,799
spills out all over the my mother also

549
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:53,120
was a Bailbonds woman MH before she uh

550
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,400
switched careers and she bailed Lenny

551
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,679
Bruce out of jail twice holy and uh as

552
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,360
well as Winston vir's daughter you know

553
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:07,480
for pot charges anyway uh

554
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,120
so so the second time Lenny uh and my

555
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,440
dad's best friend Burton marks was his

556
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,919
attorney and uh we got Lenny out of jail

557
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,120
um my sister and I were in the car and

558
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,120
Lenny I go score some [ __ ] you know and

559
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,000
because he swore in front of the

560
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,840
children she would never bail him out

561
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,039
again you know so she had her standards

562
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,000
you know I love it oh my God but I so I

563
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,480
grew up I guess with this Mystique

564
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,039
around you know who's Lenny Bruce as

565
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,480
soon as I was old enough to go listen to

566
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,960
some of his recording like wow and then

567
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,120
Justin Hoffman movie you know came out

568
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,640
it really uh was fun for me to sort of

569
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,200
get a little inkling and uh preview of

570
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,840
The Adult World of comedy and then you

571
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,919
know because I've been performing in

572
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,279
comedy I was in the Laugh Factory

573
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,919
All-Star improv Jam for better part of a

574
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:02,200
year and a half uh a lot of those folk

575
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,159
that we that I jammed with uh Brad

576
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,840
Sherwood from Whose Line Is It Anyway uh

577
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,559
Dan Connor who's now with impro theater

578
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,400
we okay we helped start Los Angeles

579
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,799
theater Sports 20 years ago and uh now

580
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,440
they're still performing but what

581
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,480
they'll do now is take one suggestion

582
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,679
and do a three-hour Jane Austin or

583
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,919
Tennessee Williams or Twilight Zone or

584
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,440
Steven S High Musical and they are just

585
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,720
amazing wow they've honed their crap so

586
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,240
beautifully and it all comes out of this

587
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,399
sort of standup but improvisation family

588
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,600
that these albums are are based on you

589
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,039
know the Nicholls and may it so funny I

590
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,200
was shooting a film uh kind of a grad

591
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,880
student film one day and Sandy Baron

592
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,200
shows up on set I was like name uh he

593
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,640
was on Seinfeld as the angry neighbor

594
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,840
stand up comedian for years and I like

595
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,840
and and you know he's he's on oxygen by

596
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,480
this time you know he's got tank with

597
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,320
him I was like Sandy bear what are you

598
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,679
doing here he goes oh you got a cute

599
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,799
producer I met her at the the

600
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,799
deli let me come with you to your film

601
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,720
set maybe I can coach some of these kids

602
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,120
I was like my God and I told him about

603
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,559
my idea of doing a documentary on the

604
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,960
family tree of improvisation yeah and he

605
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:22,960
went on a rave he was

606
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:25,440
like [ __ ] the May Nichols Lenny Bruce I

607
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,520
was doing improv in the clubs years

608
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,840
before any of them the committee I I

609
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,080
outdated them I predated them as jerks

610
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,720
stole it from me I I wish I had one of

611
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,320
these recorders to get this interview of

612
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,080
Sandy Baron going through all that it

613
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,640
was so funny to hear his anger you know

614
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,440
I should get the credit it's like you

615
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,399
know uh ramling Jack Elliott saying Bob

616
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,320
Dylan stole his whole act and got famous

617
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:54,480
the same type of thing sure sure it's

618
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,200
all incestuous but so this improvisation

619
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,480
thing now you know I'm teaching it at

620
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,039
University mhm and it's taught in

621
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,399
schools when I went to Australia uh 15

622
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:10,240
20 years ago in junior high in the high

623
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:12,720
schools the the Keith johnstonian impro

624
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,440
uh the theater Sports type improv was

625
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,600
being taught in the schools wow it was

626
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,600
very cool and they had their own TV

627
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,760
shows before who Whose Line Is It Anyway

628
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,200
brought it to popularity first the UK

629
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:27,080
and then the states and it really is uh

630
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,159
a great tool now

631
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,399
because I know facilitators and trainers

632
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,480
who are taking it to these companies

633
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:37,640
from high-tech through sales and

634
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,399
training people how to listen because

635
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,080
that's the key to Great improv it's just

636
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:45,480
how do you listen and then add logically

637
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,480
to the storytelling and it's really

638
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,440
incredible tools and and now these guys

639
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:54,120
like Dan O Conor and and Brian lman who

640
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,000
I sort of weaned on improv with are now

641
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,240
doing the Ted X talks really on

642
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,039
improvisation and such really it's fun

643
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,880
that's crazy it's interesting too that

644
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,440
it's all then based on I mean there's

645
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,600
there's a reward system of laughter no

646
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,480
laughter versus silence too and that

647
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,640
everybody must respond to that then if

648
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,480
it's working well it's it's uh there's

649
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,080
different forms of it and I try to stay

650
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,159
away from the gag proov or bar bar proov

651
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,600
where the

652
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,159
laughter uh you're not going for the

653
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,200
laugh but rather more of the

654
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,880
storytelling because ultimately even if

655
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,240
it's a dramatic piece it can be so

656
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,960
fulfilling sure can be so incredibly

657
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,360
rewarding and it takes a lot of trust

658
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,679
because our natural tendencies across

659
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,399
the board are insecure and we want to

660
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,760
please and if you're doing it for

661
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,320
someone someone else you're shooting

662
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,519
yourself in the foot you have to do it

663
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,120
for yourself and listen to the integrity

664
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,799
and and be respectful of the story is

665
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,519
number one and working at the top of

666
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:59,159
your intelligence is exhausting yes it's

667
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,159
very hard and and doing all the things

668
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,120
it's a juggling act and But ultimately

669
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,880
if you look at the early committee work

670
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,720
mhm actually not the early but all

671
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,519
through the Committees they were working

672
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:14,919
at the top of their intelligence really

673
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:17,919
bright wonderful people and they laid

674
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:21,039
the groundwork by and set the bar high

675
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,000
at the same time and that's why I can't

676
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,000
wait for uh Jamie Wright who runs the

677
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,080
San Francisco Improv Festival is doing a

678
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,480
documentary on the the committee oh

679
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,200
awesome and he got all the members that

680
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,320
were alive and attending the 50-year

681
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,240
reunion up there to do interviews and

682
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,559
then uh mixing it with the archive

683
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,279
footage it's going to be brilliant when

684
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,880
it comes out great that's so good you

685
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,679
know and the funny thing is I don't and

686
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,080
again I don't know you you know the

687
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,399
bonso come out of this improv Jazz thing

688
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,640
which great we didn't even mention is

689
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,399
that there are actual there just

690
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,679
sketches I mean shirts is a sketch yes

691
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,279
and it's fantastic and assuming I'm

692
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,200
assuming it's improv it is and it's

693
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,799
pretty much a man on the street in proov

694
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,600
they took it to the street and and what

695
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,840
you hear is what they got and it's so

696
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,240
incredible the responses from people on

697
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,720
the

698
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,679
street I I hope you'll play it yeah yeah

699
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,559
yeah I I will even though is it on tple

700
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,440
I think on TES yeah yeah yeah it's it's

701
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,279
an interesting mix this album then

702
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,480
listen to uh shirts

703
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:24,720
2010 I'm excited to hear that so okay

704
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,200
but you also said you know because

705
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,679
unfortunately I had to force you to pick

706
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,039
one album so this is the one we're like

707
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,880
all right let's do this cuz also is the

708
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,200
only one that I could find in terms of

709
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,679
the mp3s that I have um so but there

710
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,880
there's some other I mean urban Spaceman

711
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,480
was one that you that you're a big fan

712
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,600
of is is there one well Urban Spaceman

713
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:49,480
for them was their big hit mhm here stat

714
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:52,279
side at least and and it has a lot of uh

715
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,840
political statement in it and is Up

716
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:55,679
Tempo and it's a little rock and roll

717
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,360
it's where they're actually shifting a

718
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,480
little out of the Jazz and into the

719
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,159
rocking part part and it's very witty

720
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,200
and clever and such and thus it got

721
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,880
AirPlay and you know here's hippie

722
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,159
comedy music and so we don't only have

723
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,600
the the Mothers of Invention which don't

724
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,640
fit into any am or FM playlist format

725
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,640
right uh so they I think Urban Spaceman

726
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,120
because it's sort of a their pop hit uh

727
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,039
most people would know yeah so you you

728
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,679
first heard of them through these people

729
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,360
quoting them at you what did did you

730
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,600
just go out immediately and buy an album

731
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,000
like what was your no I was pretty poor

732
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,120
I you did say you were you're living

733
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,080
yeah I was doing a gypsy kind of life

734
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,120
doing those renfair days so I kept I

735
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,000
sort of filed it away and whenever I

736
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,120
would come across then years later uh a

737
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,080
bonso dog doah band record uh or I heard

738
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,279
him on Dr Demento or whatever wherever

739
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,760
uh I would pay close attention and

740
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,000
finally became obsessed with finding Mr

741
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,480
and Miss um son and daughter for Mr and

742
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,440
Mrs Mickey Mouse and then uh discovered

743
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,360
jolly farm and discovered uh you know

744
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,279
various other tunes that uh I had either

745
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:10,159
heard of or heard parts of or were filed

746
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:12,919
in my my subconscious so on on Tad

747
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,919
polles uh it wasn't really until a

748
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:18,880
couple years ago that I relistened to

749
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,519
and rediscovered hunting Tigers uh in

750
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,200

now you'll see Viv Vivian stanel is the

754
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,600
star of it mhm and I suspect I think the

755
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:36,399
original version or the version you'll

756
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:40,200

815
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,839
strange monster coming just just uh and

816
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,760
the song Death Cab for Cutie is on this

817
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,240
record yeah which as we know is a band

818
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:42,919
name right uh so they obviously in that

819
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,679
band uh pay homage to the bonso I but

820
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,159
the intro and outros on this one too oh

821
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,720
okay see that's all right and I feel

822
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,639
like I have heard them and I did look up

823
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,599
Mickey's son and daughter based on your

824
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,359
recommendation which is great and then

825
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,240
they do their little I'm

826
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:01,040
bored on as opposed to Iggy pops I'm

827
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,040
bored which is pretty good song too um

828
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,599
Sound of Music on there anyway gorilla

829
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,359

830
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,520
Urban

831
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:14,440
Spaceman is different than tadpoles so

832
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,280
strange that that I would have this and

833
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,920
I I like uh well I have Urban Spaceman

834
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,560
but I don't have Tad how did that happen

835
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,839
and it has a whole Sloop other songs and

836
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,760
then there there's this sort of uh let's

837
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,839
let's make up and be friendly which was

838
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,880
obviously an American compilation of

839
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:36,960
probably tracks that just didn't have a

840
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,280
home yeah like rollinson and you know uh

841
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,520
turkey's King of the Scruff waiting for

842
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,480
the Wardrobe it's got to be a Roger

843
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,800
Ruskin spear you know uh really fun

844
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,920
stuff I recommend once again seek out

845
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,000
find their book and get the history uh

846
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,440
and you'll see you know Neil Enz of

847
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,079
course after the rutles I don't think

848
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,800
did but maybe one of the bonso reunions

849
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,760
oh really because he's got his own thing

850
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:07,079
going you know and he tours as Neil inis

851
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,200
and and is very popular successful and

852
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,440
whereas Roger Ruskin spear will get

853
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,240
Larry leg Smith and uh a couple of the

854
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,079
other bonso who may still be alive I

855
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,920
think several of them have have kicked

856
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,720
but uh we'll do these little reunions

857
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,640
and like I mentioned three bonso and a

858
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,880
piano which I hope you play a cut of

859
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,119
okay yeah all right I will I will you

860
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,760
can download you can upload maybe yeah

861
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,280
that be good so as you can see also

862
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,079
Roger Ruskin spe has solo stuff

863
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,000
out it's an insane cover and these are

864
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:45,920
the robots those are the robots wow holy

865
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,119
crap that's fantastic um man okay so you

866
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,040
that that's what's so funny to me though

867
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,280
is that it stuck with you for so long

868
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,160
before you actually heard it for real

869
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,480
for it was actually fin yeah because I

870
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,599
was at a a point where I was sort of

871
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,400
you know rebelling from my parents so I

872
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:07,400
was out living on this Fair site and and

873
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,520
looking for mentoring or guidance and

874
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,440
all and all of a sudden he these hippie

875
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,440
guys singing this ridiculous music that

876
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,000
was really quite charming and and there

877
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,280
was you could tell there was a lot of

878
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,760
reverence and uh play and I was like Wow

879
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,160
and that stuck with me yeah and and then

880
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,119
I saw what these guys were doing with

881
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,160
their Fantasy Fair and that stuck with

882
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,720
me and and so then I would

883
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,000
seek out the Mystic Knights of the Oingo

884
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,319
Boingo and find that they as you know

885
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,280
Oingo boingo's music is just fun as can

886
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:41,280
be yeah and uh the whole Danny Elfman

887
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,839
soundtrack stuff uh you know it's even

888
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,920
though once again he steals from

889
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:47,640
everyone you hear Nino Rota from felini

890
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,680
films and you hear all these different

891
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,319
places that he's stolen from steal from

892
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,240
the great and and imitate and celebrate

893
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:58,079
uh the the Cinematic feel so these

894
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,000
albums if you're

895
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,280

00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,760
scenes each each one you can

902
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,480
cinematically see them as they're being

903
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,480
told or acted out the fire sign theater

904
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,800
stuff Nick danger you know it's uh you

905
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,359
got these visuals when you know TV is

906
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,400
just commercial garbage and and you had

907
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:29,800
these escapes right

908
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,359
what's great too about this is I I

909
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,440
noticed on the back this it says da da

910
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,720
for now apparently they they were

911
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,040
originally going to be called the bonso

912
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,160
dog da da band like just be liter

913
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,440
literal yeah yeah but then they went to

914
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,359
dudah apparently originally daada though

915
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,000
it was one apparent this is this is it's

916
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:46,839
a very hotly contested amongst the

917
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,240
members of the group even so but I just

918
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,960
like that it's not just improv it's also

919
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,800
just like Tristan Zara it's just insane

920
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,119
it's just they're not just playing

921
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,880
they're not just doing Tri it's not just

922
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,040
like tribute jazz music it's not just

923
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,480
one thing it's very it's it is we have

924
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,119
not done it justice by talking about it

925
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,680
you can't explain it it's very I I don't

926
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,160
think I I cannot find a way like you

927
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,640
could say hey kind of sounds like he's

928
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,560
doing Winchester Cathedral there but

929
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,960
also it sounds like a Monty Python

930
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,599
version of that you know and it's prey

931
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,960
python so you know it's yeah it's very

932
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:20,160
hard to do justice and it's funny

933
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:24,240
because you have sort of the sound that

934
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,400
uh in America we might expect to hear in

935
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,599
a shaki's pizza when they used to have

936
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,359
musicians you know banjo player Dixie

937
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,240
you

938
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:37,160
know combined with Monty Python it was

939
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,520
just like no well is that interesting

940
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,200
have you met anybody from the band other

941
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,200
than the the radio interview yeah no I

942
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,240
haven't I wish yeah yeah yeah I would

943
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,160
like that uhuh um did this lead you down

944
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,839
other paths that we haven't talked about

945
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,440
like did the bonso dog pan leave you

946
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,119
elsewhere Lead You elsewhere in terms of

947
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,040
like other other comedy to seek out or

948
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:01,000
even other music to seek out or is it is

949
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,040
it its own thing uh it's sort of its own

950
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,560
thing I I uh have though these wacky

951
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,560
tastes that it has

952
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:14,280
encouraged uh and and there are

953
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:18,040
contemporary bands that have this kind

954
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,720
of fun I in fact had um what were they

955
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,800
called the the space Spacemen from the

956
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,720
planet so and so uh on my my radio show

957
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,040
I'd have uh bands that were usually

958
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,119
young folk who had humor in their music

959
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,160
yet good musicianship combination that

960
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,440
that Thrills me um like I said you know

961
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,640
I'm a a Frank Zappa fan yeah I'm

962
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,839
surprised nobody's picked it for the

963
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,520
show honestly it's not strictly comedy

964
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,760
of course but but there's so much

965
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,520
irreverent humor you know uh from

966
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,599
titties and beer to uh a a Jewish

967
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,440
princess to uh you know Disco Boy

968
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:58,640
there's there's comedy all through

969
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:01,000
Frank's stuff yeah plus incredible

970
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,640
musicianship yeah my friend Dave he said

971
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,880
when he auditioned for Frank it was one

972
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,440
of the hardest auditions he ever had and

973
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,319
Frank you know he kept up so he was

974
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,839
offered the the to be in the band but

975
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,720
shortly before Frank called him back

976
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,640
Ambrosia called him back so Dave ended

977
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,760
up in ambrosia but uh people that you

978
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,920
meet or or you can even find like Ruth

979
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,960
Underwood who played the The Vibes for

980
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,800
Zappa she'll talk about Franken then

981
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,440
demonstrate some of the complicated you

982
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,160
know St alonso's pancake breakfast

983
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:35,680
xylophone solo for you and it's insane

984
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:38,079
it's insane but so fun yeah it takes you

985
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,839
on a trip and and an adventure and has a

986
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:45,560
story to tell as well uh Frank's just

987
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:48,880
you know as everyone knows is is

988
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:51,240
Legend and I think his huge influences

989
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,200
were were the 12

990
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,280
atonal uh Records that his father had in

991
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,240
his collection he was like what is this

992
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,800
complicated stuff and grew to understand

993
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,319
it and bring it into his playing and

994
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,839
like the bonso have this improvisational

995
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,920
Jazz sort of foundation yeah and

996
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,200
everyone had to be great musicians

997
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:15,760
whether they

998
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:18,160
played a an iron press or uh uh the

999
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,400
washboard you know it just all these

1000
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,720
strange instruments came into play is it

1001
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,520
I and I don't know if you since you not

1002
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,559
only are an artist but you teach artists

1003
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,520
or you teach art there is that thing

1004
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:30,359
that you're talking about with Frank's

1005
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,200
zaa where there's this desire to pick

1006
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:34,559
this stuff apart to figure it out I mean

1007
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,920
is there something like for acting was

1008
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,559
that was it acting for you were you're

1009
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,880
just like I want to pick out these bits

1010
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,400
and piece or was there any one

1011
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,079
particular thing for you or is it just

1012
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,160
that way for art for you gosh that's a

1013
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,200
little complex and also a little muddled

1014
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,240
but but but you know it's inspiring

1015
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,280
though it I look because I teach film

1016
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,400
acting mhm

1017
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,440
and there really is no one technique

1018
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,640
that works for everyone yeah so you need

1019
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,920
to have uh the ability to create the

1020
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,520
stimuli to get the emotional marks that

1021
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,880
a character May demand and for one

1022
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,960
person that stimuli may come from

1023
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:15,640
Meisner fantasy charging uh for someone

1024
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,480
else it's got to be actions and also

1025
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,240
another person that takes sense memories

1026
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,240
or emotional recall you know you have

1027
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,319
the Stella Adler you have the the uh lee

1028
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,160
strawberg you have the Meers some people

1029
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,800
like the the uh Asian a martial art of

1030
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,119
acting that Suzuki is has created or

1031
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,839
some like an Bogart and Tina landow's

1032
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,720
viewpoints version there's all these

1033
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:39,240
different techniques that work

1034
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,920
externally some are internally some are

1035
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,359
very Zen oriented you just let the

1036
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,800
character take over if the writing's

1037
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:47,079
good and and it's interesting because

1038
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,920
with great music it's the same way

1039
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:50,760
there's some who have taught themselves

1040
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,800
how to play and others who have spent

1041
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,240
six hours a day slaving and learning

1042
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,319
excruciatingly how to play their

1043
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,040
instruments and then uh some who can

1044
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:02,760
only read the music and others who can

1045
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,839
improvise right uh so it's I see in your

1046
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,200
question this profundity for me to uh

1047
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:12,720
you know Co you know I I can't say that

1048
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:14,079
I have the ability to uh make all these

1049
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,720
magical things happen that these

1050
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:20,359
musicians can but it is really fun to

1051
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,960
see example in my uh improvisational

1052
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:24,880
teachings that we just finished the

1053
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,720
semester up at Sonoma State the uh

1054
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,240
students have Revelations that yes I

1055
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,119
have to be truthful in how I'm feeling

1056
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,960
and start with that real energy than

1057
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,559
rather than coming from something fake

1058
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,079
or uh you know I give them tools

1059
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,800
hopefully that they will learn not only

1060
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,319
just how to do improv but take into

1061
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:46,760
their lives sure and live a a sort of

1062
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:51,520
deeper whatever they do deepen and and

1063
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,520
uh yeah boy talk about

1064
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:58,200
[Music]

I lied when I said I'm not going to ask

1081
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:00,160
you about back to the future and here's

1082
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,800
why uh we're talking about this band

1083
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,559
that is doing this very familiar thing I

1084
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,960
think that most people at least when

1085
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,599
they came out you're familiar with

1086
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,599
that's the crap your parents listen to

1087
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,800
right so this this imitation thing as

1088
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:15,200
something of an okay mimic myself I mean

1089
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,000
I would first have been aware of your

1090
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,160
work as having to imitate a pretty

1091
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,640
famous piece of film history and you're

1092
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,440
doing it behind layers of makeup first

1093
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,680
right right yeah so like I don't know

1094
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,200
like I I do want to know where your

1095
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,040
brain was when you're doing that and

1096
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,319
like what the challenge was well the

1097
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,119
first of all uh I I knew crisen the year

1098
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:36,839
before he got the first back the future

1099
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,960
really yeah I did a film with him up at

1100
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:41,720
AFI and I found him a very compelling

1101
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,000
really interesting actor I loved it and

1102
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,160
I got his number and tried to stay in

1103
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,920
touch and when the first film came out I

1104
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,280
was like I know that guy he's knocking

1105
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:54,880
it out of the park he was really great

1106
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,280
and as uh time progressed uh followed

1107
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,280
his career through River's Edge and The

1108
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,200
Doors movie and all the other stuff dead

1109
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,520
man great great work usually uh High

1110
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Caliber almost every every thing I saw

1111
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,400
him in yeah and then when I came into

1112
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,319
the opportunity to be his photo double

1113
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,920
standin as I was told I was thrilled and

1114
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,000
I even called him I said you know say a

1115
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,680
good word for me I need to get my

1116
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,640
medical so so my uh wife at the time

1117
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,920
could have our second kid get our

1118
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,880
medical coverage and he never called

1119
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,880
back and I was going for these uh itic

1120
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,160
fittings these uh basically mask these

1121
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,319
makeup sessions

1122
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,880
and uh when I had to do a screen test in

1123
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,599
the young George meup I was like wow I I

1124
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,680
guess they're going to have to have us

1125
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,160
him at one place and me at the other

1126
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,359
place on the camera at the same time

1127
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,240
because I wasn't told Jack and it was

1128
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:52,079
actually after the screen test was over

1129
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,319
uh zamus turned to the cinematographer

1130
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,359
dean Cy and says what do you think I

1131
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,319
think we got Chrisman without the

1132
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:59,160
trouble I was like what and and then I

1133
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:00,400
heard from my makeup artist that chrisen

1134
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,200
was not coming back I was like I

1135
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,920
couldn't fathom how they were going to

1136
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,440
do this film without him yeah now if you

1137
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,440
look through history there's always been

1138
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,319
imitators like Billy West was a famous

1139
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:16,240
Charlie Chaplain imitator who uh I'm not

1140
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:18,280
talking about Billy West from W talk not

1141
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,839
know this yeah Billy West from I'm

1142
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,920
talking the early 20th century he made

1143
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:25,800
Charlie Chaplain movies as the Trap and

1144
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,839
I don't know if Charlie sued him or not

1145
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,280
for that brand new to me the studios may

1146
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,960
have but there were other chaplain

1147
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,599
imitators Larry Simmon I think did some

1148
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,960
chaplain films and uh if you look look

1149
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:39,000
back you know Darren on bewitch got

1150
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,160
replaced and they got an actor who look

1151
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:47,520
similar uh you know the studios either

1152
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,839
by uh death or other obligations or

1153
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,839
handcuffing with negotiations whatever

1154
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:56,240
have from time to time had to replace

1155
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:58,040
actors uh and you can look at it as a

1156
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,880
tribute

1157
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,839
to that great work of that actor you

1158
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:06,280
could look at it as cashing in uh and

1159
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,119
and abusing or you could look it as to

1160
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,839
what they were in the back future case

1161
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:13,319
is they had negotiations break down you

1162
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:14,280
know chrisin wanted script approval wow

1163
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:16,160
all right I don't think they were going

1164
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,480
to give that even to Michael J fox sure

1165
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,640
yeah uh then I'd heard he wanted the

1166
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,359
same money as Michael and then uh they

1167
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,559
offered him I think a 100,000 and he

1168
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:29,319
counted with a million and and uh you

1169
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,119
know so the as as it went you know the

1170
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:33,119
first film was George's Story the second

1171
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,400
film was Marty's story and the third

1172
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,160
film was Doc's story so George was kind

1173
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,359
of relegated to a support player yeah

1174
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,839
and although had he come back for part

1175
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,119
three he would have played Sheamus you

1176
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,440
know the Michael as if Michael didn't

1177
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,480
have enough to do already they gave it

1178
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,680
to him so uh it was odd you know at

1179
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,040
times I was like am I a scab here this

1180
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,040
is weird because the first time Michael

1181
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,839
saw me in the makeup he was like

1182
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,520
Christman ain't going to like this and

1183
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:02,400
and often the director even referred to

1184
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,400
me as crisen and Leah at one point

1185
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,079
introduced me to her mom after we shot

1186
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,960
the film and here's the the actor who

1187
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:11,799
played Crispen you know it's oh God what

1188
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,640
am I doing oh Jesus luckily you know

1189
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:16,200
this is 26 years ago now it's all of

1190
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,119
course of course but and the and the

1191
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,559
studio had announced all the original

1192
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,920
actors were coming back to reprise their

1193
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:24,680
roles and so they want to keep me a

1194
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,880
secret and I could not forward my career

1195
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,280
by advertising I everything that I tried

1196
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,799
to do to promote myself the plug got

1197
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,920
pulled mysteriously on or I got blocked

1198
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:38,319
or took me more than uh 6 months just to

1199
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:41,400
get photos uh from from the studio so it

1200
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:44,680
was a a nasty kind of scene you know

1201
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,000
thank you Spielberg and Company but uh

1202
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,559
you know it's kind of water under the

1203
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,400
bridge now there's a lot of distance and

1204
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:51,000
yet there's still this Feud it's very

1205
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,760
strange that chrisen and Bob Gail still

1206
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,799
have this Feud Hatfield and McCoy and

1207
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,440
I'm like you guys get over it seriously

1208
00:50:55,799 --> 00:51:01,040
do some reunions make it a fundraiser

1209
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,200
for Michael's charity yeah yeah yeah and

1210
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,839
the fans would love it too to see him I

1211
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,880
would freak out with Tom Wilson you know

1212
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:09,359
with with everyone from the cast doing

1213
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,760
some big tributes yeah yeah yeah you

1214
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:13,359
know I don't know how much longer Chris

1215
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,040
Lloyd's going to last right sure uh

1216
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,760
Francis Lee McCain you know we're we're

1217
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:21,000
all you know the the young leads now are

1218
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,359
all in their late 50s sure so it's it

1219
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,079
would be good to celebrate with the fans

1220
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,079
now in public and and keep raising money

1221
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,799
for the Parkinson's Foundation cuz

1222
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,000
really if it comes down to it it's all

1223
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:35,319
about Michael they wanted Michael for

1224
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,160
for U Marty McFly from the day one

1225
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:40,240
basically but he wasn't available

1226
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,920
because of family and so they forced

1227
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,760
Eric stz down their throats because he

1228
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,440
had just come off being a hit on mask

1229
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,119
you

1230
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,240
know poor kid yeah but he was good he's

1231
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,760
a good actor very good method actor but

1232
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,079
he wasn't doing the comedy that they

1233
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,160
needed Michael's Michael's got this

1234
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,000
great formula for comedy it's just

1235
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,640
brilliant one of the few times you ever

1236
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
see an actor call

1237
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:05,319
cut it's like wow you know generally as

1238
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,400
an acting coach I I tell my students

1239
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:09,480
never cut yourself never call cut his

1240
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,920
gold to be mind after the dialogue ends

1241
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,960
yeah and and he said cut can we do it

1242
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,920
over I and and believe it myself and

1243
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,400
when Michael who knows his craft inside

1244
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,319
and out says that the director has no

1245
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,960
choice but say absolutely Michael let's

1246
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,000
get it let's get it the way you want it

1247
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,599
yeah you know because he really is is

1248
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,240
great and is very smart hire competent

1249
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,000
Talent both on your crew and your cast

1250
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,480
and just sit back and solve problems of

1251
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,160
course yeah yeah what did you do to I

1252
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,640
mean was it just all right I'm going to

1253
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,319
watch some stuff or I'm just going to

1254
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:44,000
how did you just do it did you just know

1255
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:45,520
the impression well I I because it's not

1256
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,319
that simple it's not as simple as ah

1257
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,799
here's an algorithm I've got the voice I

1258
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:51,559
study I when I first started playing

1259
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:54,280
Stan Laurel at Universal Studios if you

1260
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:55,520
went to Universal between ' 87 and 2001

1261
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,440
and you had your photo with Laurel and

1262
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,920
Hardy Charlie Chapman Grouch marks

1263
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,720
chances are it was with me that's great

1264
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,200
and I was in between TV and film roles

1265
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,599
and I got the opportunity to audition to

1266
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,079
play Stanley and I remembered seeing

1267
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,280
Laurel and Hardy as a kid but I didn't

1268
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:13,400
remember very well I was doing

1269
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,720
everything very silly I needed the work

1270
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,799
though and I think I don't remember if I

1271
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,599
would wore my underwear on the outside

1272
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:22,440
or my bowler I'm sure was too big anyway

1273
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,640
the actor playing Oliver Hardy knew my

1274
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,040
work from a production where I played

1275
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,880
mutio in Romeo and juli in Hollywood and

1276
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,839
he says to the boss he says I know this

1277
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,119
guy he's got talent I'll train him MH

1278
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,480
and within two weeks I was doing a

1279
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:38,680
passable Stan Laurel awesome and through

1280
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:41,640
that it opened such uh a great place for

1281
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,319
me of reverence for Stan Laurel's uh

1282
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,960
talent because he often not only wrote

1283
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,400
but he also edited he sometimes directed

1284
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,680
H roach would only give him one credit

1285
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,160
and that would be the starring credit

1286
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,400
sure but he was uh weaned on theater uh

1287
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,400
I became friends with Tony hos who was

1288
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,200
the Grand Puba of the sons of the desert

1289
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,559
the Laural and Hardy fan club that Chuck

1290
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,400
mccan and Jim MC George

1291
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:06,799
and Orson Bean and Charles MC jam mcab

1292
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,280
oh gosh what's his name anyway they

1293
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:12,480
started this International fan club

1294
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:14,520
that's still thriving and uh Lois let me

1295
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,319
look through Lois Laurel Stanley's

1296
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,480
daughter let me look through his

1297
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,760
scrapbooks wow and there's a photo in

1298
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,760
there that I hope one day the public is

1299
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:26,880
to see it's magnificent uh his father uh

1300
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,880
Stanley Jefferson's father

1301
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,319
was a theater producer and he built the

1302
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,720
children a stage in the backyard and

1303
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:34,920
there's a shot of Stanley he must be

1304
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,359
about 10 years old directing his

1305
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:41,440
brothers and sisters on this stage so he

1306
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:44,400
grew up with this amazing honing craft

1307
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,880
and even stole his father's suit uh tux

1308
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,640
to perform the first time uh up in

1309
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,280
Alston or laner wherever and his father

1310
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:56,559
unbeknownst to Stanley was in the

1311
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:59,559
audience and you know really give him a

1312
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,799
good uh speaking to afterwards you know

1313
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,799
what are you doing on the boards lad

1314
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:07,599
anyway uh

1315
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:10,079
so putting together Stan Laurel to do an

1316
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,119
accurate and respectful portrayal took a

1317
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,200
lot of doing and studying then about a

1318
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,119
year later because the the actor God

1319
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,200
bless him the little Tunisian man who

1320
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,440
played Charlie Chaplain up at Universal

1321
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,880
for many years who was a political

1322
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,920
hire just to get him away from chason's

1323
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:29,160
I think uh was just doing Charlie no no

1324
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,960
great service he had stolen a a mime

1325
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,359
from Marine World Marine lands uh act

1326
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,799
you know tickling people behind the ear

1327
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:40,839
with the straw and and was in shorts and

1328
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:42,839
a bad no makeup except a mustache and

1329
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:45,440
darken the eyebrows and and it was

1330
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:49,559
infuriating me because Charlie needed to

1331
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,720
be uhuh respected so we finally got the

1332
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,680
uh the managers up there to get this guy

1333
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,520
and make him in a proper costume and and

1334
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,280
his Charlie got better uh and then put

1335
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:02,240
chaplain together and and would replace

1336
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,160
him on days off with other actors like

1337
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,079
Billy Scutter who played Charlie for IBM

1338
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,359
for many

1339
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:12,400
years and then put together doing grouo

1340
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:14,680
and I even got a a grouo chicko and a

1341
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,280
Harpo and I remember one of our first

1342
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,799
big gigs was for City of Hope a tribute

1343
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:25,960
to the Marx family where Robert Marx

1344
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:27,720
zeppo son and uh Harpo's son bill was on

1345
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,599
piano

1346
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,000
uh Gilda Robert's wife was being

1347
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,880
honored anyway it was we got incredible

1348
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,920
feedback from the marks Brothers family

1349
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,079
that's awesome that was awesome that was

1350
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,440
very nice and and in more recent years I

1351
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:42,799
put a three stoes team together wow as

1352
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,240
you can see my hair is just right for

1353
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:50,400
playing Larry now so we'll do these gigs

1354
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:54,559
uh that you know basically party gigs or

1355
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:57,240
sometimes stage stuff uh but through

1356
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,720
that work I learned to answer your

1357
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,680
question such a long roundabout way

1358
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,920
fascinating I love this stuff how to try

1359
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,760
to find as Michael COV who was one of

1360
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,200
stanislavski's star

1361
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,520
students uh his theory of acting is to

1362
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,799
find the character gesture okay find the

1363
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,960
essence of that character through a

1364
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:19,599
gesture and so chrisen you know had this

1365
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:22,160
this forward this forward uh uh

1366
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,599
gravitational pull pulling him forward

1367
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,599
hello I'm leading with my forehead and I

1368
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:30,880
have these gestures and and then the

1369
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:32,720
voice is a placement hey you get your

1370
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,319
damn hand

1371
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:41,119
bi oh you know and so he has this very

1372
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:43,640
uh singular energy and and feel and

1373
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:46,960
character gesture that's is his Essence

1374
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:49,440
he has this stuff going on in uh his

1375
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,359
core that it took a while to get

1376
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,680
grounded but it wasn't impossible to

1377
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:57,720
find and that's why when I'm playing

1378
00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:00,960
George age 17 M I had found that stuff

1379
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,720
and most people see George going to the

1380
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,839
car in the background and picking the

1381
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,079
fight with Biff again and kissing

1382
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:09,000
Lorraine on the dance floor and I have

1383
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,559
that Essence that crisen does so well

1384
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,319
yeah and I like to look at it as more of

1385
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:16,319
a tribute than a freaking ripoff people

1386
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:20,480
you know chrisen fans God bless them I I

1387
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:23,559
am a fan too but they'll they hate me

1388
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:27,599
it's terrible things on I know for the

1389
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:29,760
longest time I did a uh Reddit ask me

00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,520
know I I had I still have people I'd say

1397
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:47,319
about 35% of the folk out there that I

1398
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,720
meet at fanc cons were like you weren't

1399
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:53,559
George oh yeah I was in two and three

1400
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,520
uhhuh and uh you

1401
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:59,760
know it's it's it is what it is it's

1402
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,880
kind of weird and uh uh I'm very happy

1403
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,920
that I'm a part of the family and and

1404
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:07,280
they're really lovely people across the

1405
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,559
board I I don't care what Bob Gail or

1406
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,400
chrisen Glover say about each other I

1407
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,680
think they're both lovely people they

1408
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,200
just you know are at each other and uh I

1409
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,760
hope they get over it is there any truth

1410
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,119
that chrisen Glover collected eyeballs

1411
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,799
at one point that the story Tom Wilson

1412
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,240
has told I don't doubt it didn't he

1413
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,160
bring I think he brought that collection

1414
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,200
on Letterman did he really okay there we

1415
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,920
go that makes sense and I think they

1416
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,799
were glass eyeballs okay okay well

1417
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,799
that's fine I don't think they were real

1418
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:30,200
ones that would say because that would

1419
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,599
be a little strange though his you know

1420
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,359
if you look at his books you know the

1421
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:37,160
rat catching books that he's sort of

1422
00:59:34,359 --> 00:59:39,839
reinterpreted from uh the 19th century

1423
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,680
and uh his music you know there's an

1424
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:44,960
album for your show yeah that's a good

1425
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,640
call he's supposed to be

1426
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:52,599
walking he's a cook and you know he's I

1427
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,760
don't uh pity him you know he he still

1428
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:57,160
whines a lot but you know he's got a

1429
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:59,280
castle I think in Romania or somewhere

1430
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,599
and I think a home in Utah and probably

1431
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,400
still has apartment in in Hollywood

1432
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,880
anyway he's he's had a great career

1433
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,720
makes a lot of money because of my work

1434
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,799
on the film you know he settled out of

1435
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,480
court when he said it's not fair that

1436
01:00:09,799 --> 01:00:13,440
you made another actor up to look like

1437
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,559
me and misled people and used my footage

1438
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,680
without giving me very much money right

1439
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:20,480
so he got you know his three4 a million

1440
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,200
dollars where I got maybe over the 26

1441
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,720
years with residuals I I don't know if I

1442
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:28,520
got a 100,000 Jesus Christ you know all

1443
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:32,200
right that's fun yeah I I don't have

1444
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:34,280
to anyway I celebrate actually the fans

1445
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,160
in the movies I mean those are great

1446
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,960
great stories you're do great things

1447
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,960
with it though like like that's the only

1448
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,160
way to do it justice I think because

1449
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,359
other you know like just performing is

1450
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,799
one thing but like if you're actually

1451
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:47,240
doing something for charity that's

1452
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:49,319
that's positive yeah I mean I still have

1453
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,000
to put food on the table so I I can't

1454
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:54,280
give everything but usually every

1455
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,559
ComicCon I go to I I try to give a good

1456
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,839
chunk back awesome to either

1457
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:02,280

01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:01,680
tune because I've uh as you may gather

1480
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,599
I'm a a audio file and an archist of

1481
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,640
early sound the actor who played Oliver

1482
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,079
Hardy used to collect cylinder records

1483
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,559
wherever we'd do appearances I'd help

1484
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:11,000
him find cylinders finally I was like I

1485
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,520
think I'm going to start getting these a

1486
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,599
couple years into it and so I have

1487
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,640
amassed a nice collection of cylinder

1488
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:20,599
records and a lot of the ones I lean

1489
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:23,480
towards are Vaudeville and Music Hall

1490
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:25,920
especially comedians you know I have me

1491
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:29,279
back on and we'll do a show on Marie

1492
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,400
drer yeah I love Marie dressler's stuff

1493
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:36,480
very a lot of it of course is based in

1494
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,480
menaly which is derogatory now but some

1495
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,000
of my favorite songs that come out of

1496
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,599
mist Z are laughing songs uh uh an

1497
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,319
actual known freed slave George W

1498
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:49,559
Johnson late in his life recorded these

1499
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:51,400
great laughing songs now they they don't

1500
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,440
have titles that you you're going to

1501
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:57,839
like but they're really lovely fun

1502
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,839
things and they're all

1503
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,319
you know and they go on and this sort of

1504
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,240
thing so laughing Blues is a bit of a

1505
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:09,240
laughing song and I have you know also

1506
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:12,520
discs of various laughing water and the

1507
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:14,079
okay laughing record and the uh you know

1508
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,960
almost all the record labels would have

1509
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,480
their own Laughing Song and then there's

1510
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,920
popular jocular Dr Brown of Camden town

1511
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,160
which is a laughing song I have all

1512
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,799
these laughing I probably have 40 or 50

1513
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,720
laughing songs in my collection wow

1514
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:30,160
Spike Jones has a great laughing song uh

1515
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:33,160
there's just so many great ones and so

1516
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:37,000
to hear the bonso dog D dudah band or

1517
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,960
daada band uh have a laughing song is is

1518
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,400
uh very was very rewarding for me and

1519
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,599
that's on this record it's pretty

1520
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,240
fantastic like you can't not laugh again

1521
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:46,480
that's the whole point but I mean that's

1522
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,480
just it like it's wonderful and then you

1523
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:52,400
know some of the uh the songs like by a

1524
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:54,359
waterfall you know uh are kind of

1525
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,319
psychedelic they even mention LSD in it

1526
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:59,680
and canyons of your mind is definitely

1527
01:03:57,319 --> 01:04:03,960
psychedelic uh so it's it's it's great

1528
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:06,599
for uh the trippy hippie culture that uh

1529
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,200
hopefully will come back and get people

1530
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:10,920
you know Back Into Love instead of

1531
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,880
abusing immigrants that

1532
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,440
be I don't want to get too political

1533
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,520
here um I think you rest assur hopefully

1534
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,000

1535
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,520
