[Music]

2
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,359
the year is

3
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,080
1969 the uh the album is how can you be

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,560
in two places at once when you're not

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,279
anywhere at all the artist is the fire

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,840
sign theater and my guest this week is

7
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,000
Phil Henry thanks for being here thanks

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,239
very much Jason it's a great album and

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,920
uh when did you first hear it I guess

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,680
it's a question you know that that's

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,840
really interesting you you said it was

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,199
69 when it was released I don't think I

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,640
I don't think I listened to the whole

14
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,680
thing through until maybe 1970 or 71 I

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,079
was I believe out of high school maybe I

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,320
was still in high school mhm but um

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,960
fires sign theater had been on local Los

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,439
Angeles radio and they were doing a show

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,360
at night on Sunday nights on krla called

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,680
Radio free Oz Oz right yeah and uh that

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,240
group of guys that was led by Peter Berg

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,000
who I believe has since passed on um

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,360
then uh morphed into this fire sign

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,960
Theater which uh became a um a live

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,880
improv group I I or not improv a live uh

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,240
comedy theatrical group but I I always

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,920
consider them first and foremost

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,960
recording artists you know I can't even

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,479
imagine what they must have been like on

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,600
stage yeah that's one thing that's

31
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,520
always kind of uh even after speaking

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,320
with Phil Proctor a couple times I still

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,520
don't quite get a feel for what their

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,040
live out what their live shows were like

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,680
as compared to this because it's the

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,240
best produced outside of like and it's

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,920
it's I would say the content's more

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,799
sophisticated obviously than chich and

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,159
Chong but uh the production value is

40
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,320
I'll put them both at about the same

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,479
level it's really just gorgeous sounding

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,840
stuff and it's you know it's just for a

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,799
whole 28 minute sign it's it's non-stop

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
sound effects in atmosphere and that's

45
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,600
one of the great things about them yeah

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,280
and obviously they're in character and

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,120
they're doing a multitude of characters

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,319
and uh this is a a Columbia release and

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,640
Columbia Records Was the Same label as

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,879
in those days the Birds Bob Dylan they

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,280
they were very familiar with um I don't

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,760
know what you'd call you know uh

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,239
alternative rock and

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,959
roll the underground and so on so they

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,200
had the the benefit of all of that all

56
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,319
these guys were from LA but I'm not sure

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,480
I know where this was recorded uh was it

58
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,040
recorded in New York or I I was trying

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,160
to figure that out myself actually uh as

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
far at one point we are going to be

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,040
going down each of the pretty soon we're

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,000
going to be recording uh standalones

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,560
about each and every fire sign album

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
with Phil Proctor telling us what it was

65
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
like making them so I guess we'll

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,959
discover more then so that'll be fun

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,319
dude I'll look forward to that

68
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,519
absolutely that's be great a little side

69
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,360
note I I used to work at KX FM in Los

70
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,400
Angeles which was at Columbia square

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,360
that was at the corner of Sunset

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Boulevard and Gower MH and I was told

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,400
that that was before it was the uh radio

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,319
station and and the television station

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,560
it was Columbia Records in Los Angeles

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,239
and uh that there were certain sessions

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,080
done there for Columbia artists

78
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,040
including uh Dylan so it's entirely

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,120
possible that these guys were you know

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,640
in La when they did them right right

81
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,560
yeah that that that would make the most

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,159
sense what I want to sort of get a feel

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,280
for you know again it's one of the

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,680
things that I'm going to have to ask him

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,599
about is how long this kind of stuff

86
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,480
took who you know and I don't know if

87
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,400
there were any like live sound effects

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,159
cuz it's a lot of it's way too produced

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,879
but uh except for the the Nick danger

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,599
thing is all the sound effects are kind

91
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,519
of obvious and intentionally kind of

92
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,400
stilted yeah yeah and and uh do you

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,040
think it's been a while since I've heard

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,959
the Nick danger bit but the movie that

95
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,319
they're satirizing which not kasablanca

96
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,519
I said Kaz Blanca I meant meltis Falcon

97
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,200
right right right um I I I wonder if

98
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,400
that was a comment on on how you know

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,640
ridiculously stilted all of those films

100
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,879
seem to all of us at the time because

101
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,040
there's a generation of young people

102
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,959
that are today reacting to the 70s and

103
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,920
the 80s and the '90s back then we were

104
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,600
reacting to a lot of the TV stuff we saw

105
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,959
in other words you know on Saturday

106
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,759
morning we get up and get our Cheerios

107
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,600
and the only thing that was on

108
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,280
television was a rerun movie and it was

109
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
generally something like cablanca or

110
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,280
multis falcon or or Laur and Hardy so

111
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,919
that was U obviously a place where you'd

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,120
mine you know your satire in those days

113
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,160
for sure for sure and there's this uh

114
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,080
obvious mix of reverence and irreverence

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,759
for the same stuff which is I think

116
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,560
might throw some people off nowadays if

117
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
they don't they they want to know they

118
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,000
want their satire to be obvious and they

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,039
don't want it to have any uh I don't

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
know it's you know if that makes any

121
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,280
sense they want their they want it to be

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,800
a little too um they don't want any gray

123
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,880
area where well I I I hate to sound like

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,520
the old guy you know because I I see so

125
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,199
much that's really funny these days

126
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,360
um but I I would to comment on that um

127
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,199
Jason I'd say that there was a time and

128
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,840
uh I forget where I was reading this it

129
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,280
might have been something to do with the

130
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
Greenwich Village where artists would

131
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,600
say to each other well what is he doing

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,360
now what is she doing now and they

133
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,280
didn't they didn't mean does he have a

134
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,080
deal or is he making money they meant

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,520
let's go see what crazy stuff is being

136
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,479
done because that's what it was all

137
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,720
about it didn't really matter who knew

138
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,199
uh it mattered are you pushing the

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,039
boundaries and

140
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,440
so the satire from them from then was

141
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,240
it's like Andy Kaufman I mean you know

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,479
people got a little irritated with him

143
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,280
that he wouldn't let anybody in on the

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,240
joke you know right that's what he

145
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,479
thought was so much fun and um today I

146
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,680
think uh because everything is so uh

147
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,960
about marketing it and uh

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,160
entrepreneurial you know efforts at at

149
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,840
making you know the dollar sure that

150
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,440
everybody wants to do whatever they can

151
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,120
to to make things obvious I I run into

152
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,639
that in my own you know way people

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,720
saying well well why don't you have on

154
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,000
guests and why don't you do well I I

155
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,520
first of all I wouldn't be very good at

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,120
it and second of all it's wouldn't be

157
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,880
very interesting but so I what that's a

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,160
that's a great point you make but I

159
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,360
that's funny though the idea that

160
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,639
anybody would nitpick what you're doing

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
is it easier for you now that you're

162
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,919
basically independent though are you

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,919
doing much more like that does it feel

164
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,520
more like art is or is that too no I'm

165
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,639
having more fun today than I've ever had

166
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,599
in my life and uh in and it's weird

167
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,960
because there's a lot of people who

168
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,199
think the high point of my my Act was

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,800
when we were fooling phone callers on

170
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,199
talk radio and and I suppose um yeah it

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,319
it's a wonderful thing to um EES drop in

172
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,400
on someone who is getting you know

173
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,720
Hoodwinked sure

174
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,639
um having to do that the actual um the

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,280
effort each day to paint that canvas was

176
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,080
pretty difficult and it was going

177
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,440
against Talk Radio in other words the

178
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
show was not going to be successful on

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,199
any talk station because you were

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,680
basically saying now that you've

181
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,160
listened to you know eight or nine hours

182
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,759
of talk radio here's a show that's

183
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,039
completely against it and turns it on

184
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,120
its head and you know it's kind of like

185
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,720
here's why you're a schmuck for

186
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,479
listening to it right yeah so I I I

187
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,639
think that that show is I don't know how

188
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
to put it but I think it's just sort of

189
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,120
contained in that moment of time what

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
we're doing now the Improv that I do now

191
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,879
and and the fact that it's not married

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,120
to any topicality necessarily and the

193
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,520
fact that it's completely improved and I

194
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,160
can do anything I want say anything I

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,240
want and the fact that we're making a

196
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,800
living doing it is beyond anything I

197
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,280
could hope so oh yeah yeah the big

198
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,360
difference too is I I actually I haven't

199
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,039
really asked anybody's perspective on

200
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,080
this I mean if if if you look at the 20

201
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,560
some albums that the fire sign guys put

202
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,440
out this is this is something that

203
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
you're spending I don't know how much

204
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,840
time with let's say at least a year

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,400
spending time writing it performing it

206
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,319
tweaking it recording it producing it

207
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,199
releasing it maybe doing a little

208
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,000
publicity trying to sell ity trying to

209
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,039
pimp it for lack of a better word you've

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,400
got all this and then at the end of the

211
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,960
year you've got this one thing whereas

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,319
somebody who's a podcaster or a

213
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,800
broadcaster of any kind you've got how

214
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,879
many you know how many hours a week yeah

215
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,080
you

216
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
know it's like doing a live it's like

217
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,680
doing live it's like doing comedy well

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,199
not really it's not it's not like

219
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,199
because it's not a even comedians will

220
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,879
have the set they'll have their set it's

221
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
very tight they work on it and it's the

222
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,159
same set and theaters the same way this

223
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,880
is constantly changing

224
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,080
so um it you you know if you're not

225
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,399
holding on to this stuff And archiving

226
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,279
it and cataloging it yeah it it goes

227
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,880
away and uh maybe there's a beauty in

228
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,839
that I don't know but fires sign getting

229
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,720
back to to firon theater and what you

230
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,279
just said is really dead on man um and

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
it's the very thing that I don't like

232
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,279
about maybe television or movies or

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,399
anything is that you have to spend all

234
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,760
this time waiting to see if what you did

235
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:01,000
is any good you absolutely yeah yeah and

236
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,720
uh how much fun is that not much I don't

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,399
think I mean I guess you just keep doing

238
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,399
other things you can ask Phil about that

239
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,720
too when you talk to him you know you

240
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,320
just keep doing other things and hoping

241
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,560
that the last thing that you did you

242
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,160
know one thing to mention Jason fires

243
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,959
sign theater came out at a time when

244
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,279
comedy albums uh I would say underground

245
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,000
comedy was getting airplay on

246
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,959
progressive rock what came to be known

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,800
as album rock station so when we were

248
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
kids and we flipped on an FM station and

249
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,760
we're hearing the music then you'd hear

250
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,440
drop into the middle of it in a set

251
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,640
you'd hear a bit from fire sign theater

252
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,959
you'd hear a credibility gap bit you

253
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,360
you'd hear bonso dog band or Frank Zappa

254
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,839
uh you might even hear a little um mty

255
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,800
python sure and and you don't that is

256
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,240
that isn't happening anymore anywhere as

257
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,880
far as I know no did you okay so have

258
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,680
you been in I I apologize for not

259
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,839
knowing have you been in LA in in Los

260
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
Angeles your whole life or did you grow

261
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,920
up elsewhere I I grew up in Los Angeles

262
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,079
I grew up in La through my early 20s

263
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,360
then I went down to Florida and uh was

264
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,959
working on construction work but I got

265
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,399
into radio down there and I spent the

266
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,160
next six years yeah and then I came back

267
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,200
to LA for 11 years then went back out on

268
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,360
the road doing talk radio and came back

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,200
most recently in 96 it's kind of like

270
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,279
playing baseball you know you do your

271
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,240
single a and double A and Triple A

272
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,959
before you make it to the majors so I I

273
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,959
only asked because did you ever listen

274
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,760
to or have access to KMD radio because

275
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,640
um I heard about it but I never did I

276
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
think that was the '90s am I right about

277
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,839
I think so I think cuz the the gentleman

278
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
who came on to talk about it who used to

279
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,959
listen to it all the time he didn't pick

280
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,959
an album he said I want to talk about

281
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,440
this radio station and it kind of that

282
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,880
blew my mind but it is one of those

283
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,560
things that might have been the last

284
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,360
time where comedy had really any

285
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,440
presence outside of a bunch of ging

286
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,839
hosts and that's you know what I mean

287
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,600
that's which is and I I don't know if

288
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:53,760
it's because it's not salale maybe

289
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,839
because people aren't buying comedy

290
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,959

album nowadays however it's not an event

326
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,440
it's not the same thing it used to

327
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,120
be I I don't know the um I got into this

328
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,800
argument I got into one of the most

329
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,360
sopian arguments one can get into it was

330
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,040
a Twitter argument with some brain

331
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,560
surgeon who was going on and on about uh

332
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,959
oh I don't know employment I said well

333
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,680
do you realize that there has been a

334
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,480
massive and I mean Mass

335
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,480
massive

336
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,880
industry uh sea change as well as a

337
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,839
massive change in where audience is and

338
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,120
Workforce if you want to get down to it

339
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:45,680
so what has happened in the last 15

340
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,160
years is uh unprecedented since perhaps

341
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,000
the Industrial Revolution we have all of

342
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,480
these new businesses that have started

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,040
we have an industry radio which is on

344
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,360
the verge of Extinction right we have uh

345
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,800
live performance is back man I mean the

346
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,360
money that is being made for doing live

347
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,639
performance who would ever thought it's

348
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,360
it's it's enormous we have all of these

349
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,120
individual entrepreneurial uh comedians

350
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,360
historians news commentators actors

351
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,320
historians people such as yourself Jason

352
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,600
making a living doing these

353
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,120
podcasts um so the the the comedy the

354
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,760
the the transmission of Comedy the the

355
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,079
dissemination of Comedy is completely

356
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,560
different um do I miss the time when a a

357
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,720

358
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,079

361
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,680
saying I mean they try to make it that I

362
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,040
mean Drake you know came out he doesn't

363
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,920
call it an album he called a mixtape you

364
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,600
know right and and and Kendrick

365
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,000
Lamar uh to my that's about the biggest

366
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,079
thing that's happened in music as far as

367
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm concerned over the last uh you know

368
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,600
year or so and it ain't been all that

369
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,880
big of a deal because it's about

370
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,800
individual tracks individual downloads

371
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,399
individual events MH as opposed to you

372
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,480
know

373
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,240
um do I miss the album The Comedy album

374
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,160
not really um I like the five minutes

375
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,199
six minutes 10 minute even 20 minute hit

376
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,720
and run um

377
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,800
moment um some things don't lend

378
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,240
themselves to it sure like like Twitter

379
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,920
but anyway getting back to fire sign

380
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,680
yeah I I what do you have a favorite

381
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,839
track off of here let's let's start my

382
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,680
my my favorite track is I guess it's not

383
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,160
on there man I'm so sorry uh my favorite

384
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,639
track is and you can ask Phil about this

385
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:38,440
and he'll probably say Henry's stupid um

386
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:42,600
it was How the West Was lost and it is a

387
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,480
hysterical um uh you know retelling of

388
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,880
uh uh the European American landing and

389
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,680
and uh eventually taking over this

390
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,279
country but there this this land mass

391
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,360
but the it opens with a you know

392
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,440
Columbus landing on the shore and

393
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,480
there's a priest there holding up a

394
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,880
cross at to all these Indians mhm and he

395
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,240
says uh you know uh get on your knees

396
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,959
heathens do you know what this is that

397
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm holding in front of you and the

398
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,240
Indian responds well yes that's a cross

399
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,279
a symbol of the division of the universe

400
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
into active and passive principles why

401
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,440
you

402
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,800
heathens uh I don't know whether that's

403
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,199
subtle satire or whether that's fairly

404
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,839
well transmitted but uh right to me

405
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:28,000
that's the intelligence of uh fire sign

406
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,160
theater in and of itself um we're all

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,480
both you know what it might have and

408
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,240
we're all uh we're all bozos on this bus

409
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,800
ah yep okay that that does are you

410
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,480
seeing there that tracks I was just

411
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,639
looking it up as we were talking about

412
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,600
it which I do have I have that album I

413
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,600
I'll have to give it a listen after we

414
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,399
do this but um that's where I messed up

415
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,279
dude I'm so sorry but um no I I now I

416
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,839
now know why I remember all Hill Marx

417
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:54,800
Lennon it's because of Nick danger okay

418
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:58,279
and Rocky roko and uh you

419
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,240
know all of that goofy stuff and and uh

420
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,720
uh Rocky roko Nick danger and I don't

421
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,279
even know if there was a female voice in

422
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,560
that or not uh some fake ones uh

423
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,800
definitely by the guys yeah F they're

424
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,199
really fantastic and kind of really

425
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,920
really ridiculous which is what like

426
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,600
they they at least they know their lack

427
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,360
of range when it exists you know exactly

428
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,480
yeah yeah and they really like to play

429
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,839
with that I have to ask you um given

430
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,759
your age and your generation and your

431
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,240
you know your your experience and what

432
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,800
you've passed through does it is that is

433
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,759
that funny to you listening to those

434
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,959
guys are they funny absolutely it is but

435
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,639
I I will say when I first heard him and

436
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,079
that was probably and it was this album

437
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,040
that we're sort of talking about is uh I

438
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:47,040
was God I was 13 at the time so I didn't

439
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,680
I mean here's I didn't get it I'll I'll

440
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,839
fully admit I did not get it it was

441
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,920
passed on to my my best friend by his

442
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,880
dad and I would listen to and he's like

443
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,279
this is great and I'm like okay I don't

444
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,000
understand what the hell is going on

445
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,440
here only only recently once I've I had

446
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,639
an appreciation for a production values

447
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,600
B I've got a little more knowledge of of

448
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,559
the period now now it it rings true I

449
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,319
mean here's the thing this I know why I

450
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,240
didn't get it this album is insane the

451
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,280
first 28 minutes is nonstop makes zero I

452
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,559
mean it is kind of like the speed with

453
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,360
which you do your show like just that

454
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,799
rapid fire but then add sound effects

455
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,000
add other dudes doing voices uh it's

456
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:28,640
it's kind of crazy it's it's and so it's

457
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,760
upsetting if you're 13 it's well these

458
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,160
guys were a major influence on me um

459
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,080
they were a huge influence on me by by

460
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,440
way of the pacing just like you said by

461
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,880
the reality the the reality they brought

462
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,799
to it uh not reality in the strictest

463
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,520
sense but the reality of theater sure um

464
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,000
and that theater of the mind I don't I I

465
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,880
can't say when I was a kid anybody if

466
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,120
they'd asked me if you know do you like

467
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,440
theater of the Mind well I like I like

468
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,960
audio I mean I I I like the idea of

469
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,440
being able to control all the elements

470
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,080
and you can only do that with with with

471
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,880
audio but these cats what they did um

472
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,840
forever more influenced how I wanted to

473
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,559
hear things it's like a Mad

474
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Magazine um feel you know or or

475
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:19,200
something a bit zier than that um lots

476
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,320
and lots of cartoon effects and and a a

477
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,720
really smart kind of cartoon I guess did

478
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,640
you hear these guys before you knew of

479
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,760
Monty Python I'm just curious yes yes I

480
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,600
did I did see that's all feel like

481
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,360
because it's roughly the same time

482
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,919
period and the the fanaticism with which

483
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,400
people including myself love Mony python

484
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,159
fire sign gets Dr drowned out oh no

485
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,600
question because Monty Python was

486
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,480
brilliant for a very simple reason and

487
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,640
it's something that I've learned the

488
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,200
hard way but I've learned it it's far

489
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:59,240
more fun to saiz Everyday events and

490
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,880
everyday Oddities and everyday character

491
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,440
than it is to uh be smarter perhaps you

492
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,159
know I put that in quotes and saiz

493
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,000
politics the nation you know the culture

494
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,840
which fire sign theater was all about

495
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,320
that they were all about satirizing what

496
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,559
was happening in America at that time

497
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:21,400
was was insane you know England probably

498
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,919
a bit more sedate you know um and and so

499
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,320
Monty Python reflected that they

500
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,840
reflected the the the they reflected

501
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,799
their horror if you will at the passing

502
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,080
generation before them you know God Rest

503
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,200
God God Rest their souls you know they

504
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,000
came through the London blackout and and

505
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,320
the Nazis so we can forgive them but

506
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,760
yeah Monty Python still sort of mocked

507
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,320
you know them in their Gentle Way and

508
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,919
and and I think that's why they survive

509
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,919
because what they deal with the Bureau

510
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,760
of silly walks uh the Bureau of

511
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,320
arguments the joke that kills you this

512
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,159
this [ __ ] doesn't get old man no it's

513
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,440
just for real and just like my son Chris

514
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,280
my uh third oldest stepson Chris

515
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,760
as as soon as I turned him on to Monty

516
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,880
Python he got it right away man sure

517
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,600
just right away you know like yourself

518
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,880
so I I think that was that hurt me you

519
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,679
know as an artist man having to uh grow

520
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,640
up in a culture that was really hitting

521
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,480
the political satire hard cuz I wasn't

522
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,880
really good at that [ __ ] and when I got

523
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,400
it a talk radio that's what was really

524
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,760
expected because the guy before you was

525
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,919
just talking about what a piece of [ __ ]

526
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,360
Obama was or whatever and then I had to

527
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,240
come back in and sort of make all of

528
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,000
that tile that stuff together now I'm

529
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,080
that I'm doing what I'm doing now I'm

530
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,520
far more um involved in what I think

531
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,280
really is fun and that is the the money

532
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,520
python approach I'm not knocking fire

533
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,840
sign theater those guys those cats are

534
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:49,960
smart yeah um you know college educated

535
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,000
American sists but I I I think I've um

536
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,240
at this point in my life I've had it up

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,799
to here with you know uh looking at the

538
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,440
political landscape and I would much

539
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,559
rather take a look look at uh people you

540
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,360
know sure absolutely and the one thing

541
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,960
that struck me listening to this again

542
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,960
is that uh is actually the one I won't

543
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,919
say the one thing but one of the

544
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,360
strongest ties it has with Monty Python

545
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,320
is therefore is one of the things that

546
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,960
made me laugh the hardest is just making

547
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,919
fun of the idea of austerity because

548
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,360
they were kind of picking apart a lot of

549
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:25,279
the [ __ ] that their own parents had

550
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,240
given them but maybe not all that

551
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,559
specifically it's like the idea just the

552
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,240
idea of making fun of TV

553
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,320
just even in the background or anything

554
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,360
any of the pop culture or any of the

555
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,559
culture they were just tearing apart the

556
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,320
[ __ ] that was passed down to them the

557
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,720
stuff that had run downhill so it was

558
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,120
similar but I see what you're saying

559
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,200
that it's maybe it's a little more

560
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,840
literate or a little bit more uh like

561
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,640
you say a little more ivy league even

562
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,600
though Monty Python was ivy league they

563
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,120
weren't drawing from the same well yeah

564
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,320
Monty Python was Cambridge and super

565
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,760
educated and uh you know these guys uh I

566
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,480
I can't say specifically fire sign I

567
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,080
know the guy credibility Gap and and

568
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,200
spinal tap all those dudes are Yale guys

569
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,480
you

570
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,600
know you know and

571
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,520
so there was a lot America is a big

572
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,200
place man it it it occupies a big place

573
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,840
uh in the history of this world now and

574
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,279
so there's a lot to deal with and we all

575
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,440
pick the big things you know every time

576
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,080
we go into a a store or into a

577
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,559
supermarket or like oh wow there's the

578
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,279
watermelon and there's the big thick Ste

579
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,520
stakes and we go after what's big and

580
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:31,799
and and targetable uh we miss as

581
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,120
Americans I think the Richer subtext

582
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,480
just a friendly word of advice danger

583
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,679

stop tracking mud across my

589
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,039
nice when I hit the street the rain had

590
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,880
already turned La into a mud River it

591
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,880
was a short swim down Alvarado to my

592
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,440
convertible

593
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,559
I had to get to Santa Barbara in a big

594
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,159
hurry as I whipped on malland Drive the

595
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,200
lights were just twinkling on across the

596
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,600
San fernandino Valley I could barely

597
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,039
make them out through the driving rain

598
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,480
then a hard R down beat to junga Canyon

599
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:17,720

601
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,360

coming hey yeah where am I you can't get

605
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,480
there from here but I'm looking for the

606
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,320
same old place oh you must mean the old

607
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,240
same place sunny it's right out back

608
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:44,159
here's the key Jonathan winers was a

609
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,000
genius because he did mock the average

610
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,640
midwesterner um everyone loved George

611
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,240
Carlin for his literacy sure but I got

612
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,279
to be honest with you as much as I love

613
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,000
and respect George Carlin Jonathan wyers

614
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,240
is a guy that has my heart you know uh

615
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,279
he I I I I piss my myself listening to

616
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,880
Jonathan wyers and Monty and Monty

617
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,799
Python yeah um I used to piss myself

618
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,159
listening to fire sign theater anytime

619
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,279
they just got into those marvelous

620
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,799
characterizations but um the political

621
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,159
sists like the mort SS and cats like

622
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,679
that I don't know who we have now you

623
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,799
know um don't quite get my uh attention

624
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,600
anymore and I know they were way off of

625
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,760
fire sign theater and I no no no it's

626
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,640
it's thematically were there yeah I

627
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,000
think I think fire sign their theater on

628
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,360
record and live uh having not seen it

629
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,960
live but I'm imagine the theater that

630
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,720
they brought to Comedy had never been

631
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,039
there before man I mean they never it

632
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,960
the the crazy multifaceted multicar

633
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,799
caricature kind of of and and the

634
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,000
literacy of it and as you mentioned and

635
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,240
the um and and the subversiveness of it

636
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,440
had never had never really been uh done

637
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,880
before on a big stage and um that's more

638
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,039
than anything else I think what makes

639
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,679
them so influential especially me man I

640
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,360
mean I can say all this [ __ ] I want

641
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
about Monty Python but I'm far more

642
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,559
influenced by the presentation and the

643
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,480
theater of a fire sign theater well and

644
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,880
that's the big thing too is even if even

645
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,320
if the the reference actually honestly I

646
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,200
wouldn't even call it reference heavy

647
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,520
even if some of it's beyond you or uh

648
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,559
there's so much production that it is

649
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,080
it the the second half of it is an

650
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,559
homage to and a picking apart of like

651
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,120
literal r radio drama literal radio and

652
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,320
theater of the Mind the first half is no

653
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
this is what 1969's version of radio

654
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,360
ought to be doesn't exists except for on

655
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,360
our album but it's just it's a [ __ ]

656
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,120
mind [ __ ] and it makes zero sense it's a

657
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:50,039
whirlwind of borderline references uh

658
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,640
the satire is at the same time subtle

659
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,600
like literally and figuratively

660
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,760
sometimes you can't hear the [ __ ]

661
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,640
they're saying and you're like [ __ ] I

662
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,000
have to listen closer now yeah give me

663
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,120
give me a give me an example of that

664
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,880
first side so I can uh call it back a

665
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,559
little bit well it opens up with uh um

666
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,919
[ __ ] give me one second opens up with

667
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,360
the uh the car salesman whose name is

668
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,960
very funny hi Ralph sportsport here

669
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,960
Ralph Sports sportsport is that the guy

670
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,039
yeah Ralph sportsport yep yeah yeah he's

671
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,520
that's a satirization of Ralph Williams

672
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,640
there was a guy like that yeah bald

673
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,080
Ralph Williams yeah beautiful everybody

674
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,399
knew who Ralph Williams was everybody

675
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,000
just couldn't go anywhere in La without

676
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:26,440
knowing Ralph Williams yeah and the

677
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,039
characterization is good enough that you

678
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,720
don't like I didn't didn't have I I

679
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,120
think I read that but I didn't know it

680
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,520
instinctively but it still works so well

681
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,480
yeah yeah I I don't know the car

682
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,279
salesman today cats on TV

683
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,320
today

684
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:44,480
um are just not quite the um the

685
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
salesman the car salesman we used to

686
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,640
have they were colorful wacky guys and

687
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,120
so they made their way into it the only

688
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,000
guy that was left here in La was Cal

689
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,399
Worthington and that poor man uh is so

690
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
old now you know it's just not worth it

691
00:26:54,399 --> 00:27:00,720
so that's definitely something that's

692
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,399
gone man and uh yeah that was fire sign

693
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,840
and the that's another thing too by the

694
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:07,640
way they uh didn't seem to and I like

695
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,000
this they didn't seem to worry that they

696
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,279
were being a little bit Regional there

697
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,760
um you know it it was in their world and

698
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,399
they went ahead and they commented on it

699
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,039
and um it's the same thing I grew up

700
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,320
with all kinds of New York references

701
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,279
when I was a kid watching TV or

702
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,320
listening to radio all I ever heard

703
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,799
about was New York sure New York this

704
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,159
New York that I swear of God I didn't

705
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,679
know anything about New York but all

706
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,399
these guys yeah just like done in

707
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,000
Brooklyn you know uh but it was funny

708
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,520
anyway you know the people were funny

709
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,080
and that Fishbowl that you were looking

710
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,440
at was really something else do you know

711
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,360
what the first thing you ever heard of

712
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,760
fire signs was the first thing I ever

713
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,519
heard of fire

714
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,679
sign was probably uh radio fre o when

715
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,159
they were on uh evenings okay okay um uh

716
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,480
Sunday nights on um um and I think it

717
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,480
had something to do with they did a lot

718
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,360
of stuff uh when it came to uh uh Native

719
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,799
Americans mhm and they were doing a bit

720
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,559
on how hippies were the reincar ated hi

721
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:04,559
the hippies of the day were reincarnated

722
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,679
Native Americans oh my God and then

723
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,200
sooner or later there'd be a scalping

724
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,720
frenzy uh somewhere in San Francisco so

725
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,679
you know all of this peace and love was

726
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,640
happening at the time and uh fire sign

727
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,760
was you know warning people that uh if

728
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,039
you think hippies are scary now uh

729
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,600
they're going to be wearing scalps from

730
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,760
their

731
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,880
belt yeah so yeah was that disrespectful

732
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,120
to Native people I don't know you know

733
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,000
it was more of a commentary on the um U

734
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,919
the any people buying into this peace

735
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,919
love thing that was the other thing

736
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,679
about the comics of the time fire sign

737
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,799
credibility gap whoever Lenny Bruce MH

738
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,559
none of them respected really respected

739
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,919
the so-called Peace Love ethic of the

740
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,399
Contemporary hippie I mean while it

741
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,799
sounded good and it made for great teeny

742
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,679
B you know bubblegum music they all uh

743
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:59,799
laughed at it sure and uh and that was

744
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,279
and Frank Zappa too that's guy who you

745
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,559
know we don't give him enough credit as

746
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,279
if Frank zpp I'm sure and we can we

747
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,320
could talk about this another day or

748
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,799
just something to think about Frank

749
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,360
Zappa great musician though he was and

750
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,000
he always and he wanted to be known as a

751
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,159
great musician he was serious as a

752
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,880
musician yeah his genius was the fact

753
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,640
that he was the sist of that era and he

754
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,480
was on a parallel track there was rock

755
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,760
and roll over there and Frank Zappa was

756
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,760
riding along the side just ripping it to

757
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,000
pieces you know just mocking

758
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,880
uh brutally mocking it and it was

759
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,200
hysterical yeah it was marvelous that's

760
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,840
that's one of the and we definitely

761
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,679
should because I'll be honest my my

762
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,799
experience with the Frank zap is very

763
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,279
limited so it would be fun to delve into

764
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,600
that because especially to talk about

765
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:47,760
people who are uh who represent a change

766
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,760
and who function as a change but don't

767
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,080
really get to function maybe as

768
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,240
themselves if if if that makes any sense

769
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,080
like just I'm I'm here to make a change

770
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,159
and let's hope that's enough great point

771
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,120
point because I think if Frank Zappa

772
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,600
were here and I did interview him once

773
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,200
and he was uh a wonderful guy but very

774
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,039
very sarcastic guy I I think he much

775
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,880
would have rather been known as a a

776
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,159
great guitar player because he he said

777
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,320
he said to me Point Blank you know I'm

778
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,600
as good a guitar player as jimmi

779
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,679
Hendricks and he was

780
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,480
serious and and uh but what he did and

781
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,840
did brilliantly was and there's nothing

782
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,960
like that now no there's no saturnist of

783
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,240
the current you know whatever the

784
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,360
Zeitgeist you know whatever the the

785
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,360
whether it be

786
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,960
hipop um maybe Tyler the Creator but I

787
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,679
doubt it you know um uh rock and roll

788
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,159
there's nobody out there that is is

789
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,960
looking at it pointing and laughing sure

790
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
and there should be at least one person

791
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,960
I think yeah that'd be nice

792
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,240
anyway would be it' be fun because I

793
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,279
mean I'm sure it exists too I mean it

794
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,559
does exist with comedy but at some point

795
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,720
I I don't know if it makes me a dick to

796
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:57,639
kind of get tired of people getting

797
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,960
excessively meta and it's funny to say

798
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,720
that talking about an album that is

799
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,159
pretty meta but I do get a little tired

800
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,760
of people picking apart comedy to the

801
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,399
point where they're not making comedy

802
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,840
anymore which uh what do you mean for

803
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,799
instance uh well I can't give it for for

804
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,720
in I would say I'm trying to think of

805
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,799
somebody who maybe is more of an a

806
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,440
modern-day Andy calman but oh I dig okay

807
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,360
that kind of thing and I know there are

808
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,880
people but I can't because I ignore them

809
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,600
I can't think of anybody right off I

810
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,200
know what I know what you're saying um I

811
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,080
completely agree and um I think the

812
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,279
Dumber the better so long as you're not

813
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,960
being destructive or hurtful meaning

814
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,080
sure uh I don't think it's funny to hey

815
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,080
I hear the new polio vaccine is out yeah

816
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:45,760
sure you know I I don't think that's

817
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:48,480
quite funny right but um dumb as in uh

818
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,240
for instance the Tom Brady deflate gate

819
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,880
thing MH you know that needs to be just

820
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,720
absolutely destroyed I who cares I do

821
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm a football fan whatever I'm not

822
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,200
going to waste my time it's not worth my

823
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,600
day it's not worth 5 minutes yeah and uh

824
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,320
so all of that needs far more searing

825
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,840
than it's getting mhm um beyond that you

826
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,159
know the the who we are as people man I

827
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,039
mean human the human race especially the

828
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:20,320
American people themselves have are must

829
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:23,519
must be strangling MH on all of the

830
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,559
confusion and near Anarchy right now and

831
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,080
I'm sure that we are looking desperately

832
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,080
for somebody who can make some sense out

833
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,600
of this [ __ ] and I I think the way to do

834
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,799
it is to get it back to you know the

835
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,519
average person just what makes us uh uh

836
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,080
what makes us complicit in all of this

837
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,639
confusion how can we change that you

838
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,360
know and and I'm not looking to change

839
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:44,639
the world or anything but like last last

840
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,720
night on our show I had a character on

841
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:48,480
Don mix as a character I do and he talks

842
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,159
he talks a little bit like Pete McClosky

843
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,320
used to as a congressman from the United

844
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,960
State I just love this accent you know

845
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,559
and he likes to say this guy's from

846
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,720
upstate New York was hey Don how you

847
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:00,440
doing let's get a cup of coffee and Don

848
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,600
was talking and he's saying I think it's

849
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,600
very important well it turns out the way

850
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,480
because he talks that way he I like to

851
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,000
get right up close and personal and talk

852
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,799
to people and well it turns out his

853
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,399
breath is just foul you know so while

854
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,039
he's trying to make his point you know

855
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,559
and it's very important I think at this

856
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,840
particular time uh could you and I had

857
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,840
another character done could you back

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,559
off a little bit what's what's the I

859
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,440

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,000
about it like I I I wonder like how the

899
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,480
hell like I I do try and Pitch it to

900
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,680
other people and I the part of this is

901
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,119
to be like okay maybe you won't get it

902
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,520
at first maybe you'll feel like some of

903
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,280
this is over your head maybe you'll feel

904
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,680
like well I wasn't alive in the' 60s or

905
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,720
70s so it's not going to make but I I

906
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,760
feel like the there is there's more than

907
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,640
enough silly I mean they somehow pull

908
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,800
out of they made me laugh way too hard

909
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,920
at something that's so offensive and

910
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,839
it's not it's like because I knew how

911
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,760
satirical it was I mean they used every

912
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,960
every they use every racial slur

913
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,440
possible in this one song because it's

914
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,240
supposed to be cting America and thaty

915
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,320
just like oh this is beautiful this is

916
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,680
wonderful now obvious it's a little hard

917
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,720
to separate the weat from the chaff and

918
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,560
tell who's laughing for the right

919
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,240
reasons but you hope so you hope if you

920
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,079
expose somebody to something like that

921
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,200
that they get it yeah and here's the

922
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,480
thing play that now and there's lots and

923
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,880
lots of people that won't get it

924
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,839
absolutely and lots and lots of people

925
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,680
that will therefore want to have you and

926
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:53,920
me hung by our thumbs and if they can

927
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,760
find any of the fire sign theater that

928
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,640
are still alive they'll hang them too

929
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,560
and when you try to explain it to them

930
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,960
you'll find yourself talking to idiots

931
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,440
yep and as the fires leap around us and

932
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,240
as we finally go up to our ultimate

933
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,000
martyrdom you know we're just watching

934
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,319
what are we seeing from where what are

935
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,400
we seeing from the stake that we're

936
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:14,440
being burned at a a society that is that

937
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,079
is is doomed itself with its own

938
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,319
stupidity or are we just looking at us

939
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,680
at a microcosm that happened to catch us

940
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:23,960
as we were running out of the village I

941
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,640
don't know right right um I do know

942
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,359
that perception is everything we are

943
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,640
learning that uh and so if you want to

944
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:35,400
get through to people you have to make

945
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,440
it clear man um fire sign theater is

946
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,040
talking to a college educated or a bunch

947
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,520
of college students back in 1969 1970

948
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,599
every one of us got it we're we're

949
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,200
laughing our ass up we're going out

950
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,680
we're buying tickets to the next fire

951
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,599
sign theater but take that theater

952
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,760
beyond that take it into put it on The

953
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,480
Ed Sullivan Show or H or whatever was

954
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,880
happening then sure and now you get now

955
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,520
you got some problems you know now you

956
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,280
got some some problems in uh in

957
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,839
interpreting that so

958
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,480
I yeah you know I good

959
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,119
point I do hope I I do hope that there's

960
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,680
there's there's a way I mean here

961
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,800
luckily they've got a web presence and

962
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,359
they've got people passing their stuff

963
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,839
down like my my uh my late stepfather

964
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,720
was stepfather [ __ ] father-in-law Jesus

965
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,359
Christ he was a DJ and like he was so

966
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,720
jealous of me interviewing fire sign the

967
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,520
anybody from fire sign that I was like

968
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,920
well wait a minute I feel like yeah

969
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,480
exactly right I mean he course he

970
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,599
interviewed chich and Chong back in the

971
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,160
day and I was like well are you kidding

972
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,640
you're jealous of me like this is kind

973
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,480
of mindblowing to me so it's there is

974
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,800
like there there are people who can at

975
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,440
least speak for it and I there I'm just

976
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,960
hoping that uh you know we can spread

977
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,440
the word well I think if you take fire

978
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,599
anything that fire sign theater did that

979
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,560
that addresses what you and I are

980
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:55,240
talking about Jason which is those those

981
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,240
everyday bits of of absurdity uh those

982
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,319
things need to be highlighted because

983
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,280
they did they did address them I think

984
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:04,960
they became known and I knew them for

985
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:09,319
their cultural satire and political

986
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,319
satire um but look when I was growing up

987
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:12,880
especially when I got into high school

988
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,160
college Years everybody was a marks

989
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,960
Brothers fan yeah and I was I was a

990
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,680
Laurel and Hardy guy and I'm not saying

991
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm superior to them because I was very

992
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,839
much in a minority everybody oh Marx the

993
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,640
Marx brothers were smart and look at all

994
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,960
that whack [ __ ] they did and uh you know

995
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,040
Fredonia wow how cool is that

996
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,560
and I'm laughing at Oliver Hardy getting

997
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,800
a saw blade on his head you know I

998
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,920
I I still do I still do man I believe

999
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,760
the culture has followed me a little bit

1000
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,079
more than it has the people that were

1001
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,200
Marx Brothers fans although I'm sure

1002
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,560
they would give us an argument but I

1003
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,040
think that Laur and Hardy's every man

1004
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,800
humor getting saw blades busted on their

1005
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:54,319
head or you know tripping over you know

1006
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,400
a dog is that's what comedy today uh

1007
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:57,960
that's what you laugh at I think more

1008
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,560
than perhaps the

1009
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,640
the um the sophistication of a Marx

1010
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,160
Brothers sure however you know they were

1011
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,599
the Marx Brothers so who's this you know

1012
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,400
I can't you know certainly they haven't

1013
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,400
lost in any right their cache at all

1014
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,040
yeah well although that you know they

1015
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,640
they did luck out with the Resurgence in

1016
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,760
the 70s I mean that's that's one of the

1017
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,839
reasons probably why I mean it was it

1018
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,400
was Chic to like them so that's that

1019
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,680
would be oh yeah absolutely and I

1020
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,040
wouldn't probably wouldn't know who they

1021
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,720
were if it wasn't for that Resurgence

1022
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,280
and I'm I mean I would probably be more

1023
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,560
of a mark Brothers guy than a Laurel and

1024
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,240
Hardy guy but that's cuz I didn't grow

1025
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,839
up with Laurel and Hardy the other thing

1026
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,359
is that the Marx Brothers survived

1027
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:35,319
Laurel and Hardy died uh Oliver Hardy

1028
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,480
was gone by the 50s and Stan Laurel died

1029
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:39,960
in the 60s uh Groucho Marx on the other

1030
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,240
hand was was alive through the pretty

1031
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,400
much the 70s and had a great right uh

1032
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,520
line in fact I'm sitting listening to

1033
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,280
the radio I'm working at WBBM in Upstate

1034
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,319
New York uh I don't know what it was the

1035
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,680
mid 70s late 70s and I'm listening to

1036
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:54,560
ABC Entertainment News where it came out

1037
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,400
that Richard Nixon's enemies list

1038
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,200
included grouo marks okay and Mark and

1039
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,800
and Marx's quote was I deny everything

1040
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,440
because and this is the ABC news guy

1041
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,480
saying when reached at his home grouo

1042
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,280
Mark said I deny everything because

1043
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,680
everything I deny is a lie end quote you

1044
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,280
know so we we still had Groucho hanging

1045
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,560
around and uh and uh giving us and he

1046
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,319
hosted a game show right my mother never

1047
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,160
missed You Bet Your Life which was the

1048
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,359
gro marks it was a who gave him that

1049
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,760
show and why it was a stroke of Genius

1050
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,720
cuz it was a fun damn show and yeah

1051
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,440
Laurel and Hardy were strictly film

1052
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,000
actors film comedians uh two realer

1053
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,520
Comics who just happened to discover two

1054
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,440
characters that were entirely relatable

1055
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,560
very real lots of lots of pathos going

1056
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,960
on there and uh and great comic

1057
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,800
invention uh in terms of just Behavior

1058
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,960
especially with Oliver Hardy and all the

1059
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,640
weird [ __ ] that he did so I I'm the kind

1060
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,839
of guy intellectually and I'm sitting in

1061
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,760
a room like you Jason a bunch of people

1062
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,319
and we're all talking comedy and I would

1063
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,560
be afraid to say I wasn't a mark

1064
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,160
Brothers fan cuz I didn't want I don't

1065
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,440
want people to throw [ __ ] at me right

1066
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,240
right but if it's just if it's just you

1067
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
and me sitting down drinking beer I'm a

1068
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,640
Laur and heart I'm a Laur and Hardy fan

1069
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,200
so I well and that's just the thing

1070
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,960
that's completely legit I mean I had to

1071
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,200
turn around on on the three stoes a

1072
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,800
couple years ago too and I had to be

1073
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,079

00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,079
about the three stoes as men and oh yeah

1090
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,839
by the way they were actors it was it

1091
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,200
basically took them and it created a

1092
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,119

characterization of the three guys uh is

1098
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:19,559
is pretty damn good man yeah and the and

1099
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:22,520

away from fire sign theer no I was about

1106
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,240
to pull us back don't worry but I got to

1107
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,319
tell you I think I think what we're

1108
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,040
talking about fire sign theater be right

1109
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,599
up their alley you know in terms of uh

1110
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,599
who their influences were you know for

1111
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,559
sure I mean actually what's interesting

1112
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,880
too is the Phil Proctor's first Al uh uh

1113
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,440
episode of the show was talking about

1114
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,880
Bob and Ray and I was going to ask you

1115
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,359
if you ever listened to Bob and Ray I

1116
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,040
wasn't sure because it's it's it's an

1117
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,359
older influence obviously it's well Bob

1118
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,880
and Ray were a radio show New York yeah

1119
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:02,839
and so that right away uh Phil may have

1120
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,839
been Phil's older than me he might have

1121
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:05,160
heard them when he was in college I

1122
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,160
don't know where is Phil from LA or is

1123
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,079
he from New York do you know ah [ __ ]

1124
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,559

1125
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:14,480

1126
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:16,599

1201
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,319
Phil doctor at the very least and yeah

1202
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,680
obviously the culture is going to inform

1203
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:05,760
what fire sign becomes but then I'm I'm

1204
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,520
curious what I want to know and this is

1205
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,319
something that that it's it's real hard

1206
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,400
to track is I want to know what the

1207
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:14,160
undercurrent that they were writing and

1208
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,319
helping create the fire sign that is

1209
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,160
like how that influenced comedians

1210
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,240
specifically is there something like in

1211
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,920
your own work that you can Peg as being

1212
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,160
something oh this is very fire sign

1213
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,160
something that I've done or something

1214
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,760
that's clearly been influenced by them

1215
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:31,119
yeah oh every day

1216
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,839
uh the my show is a fire sign theater

1217
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,800
style show there's a lot of characters

1218
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,960
going on there's a lot of bumping into

1219
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:42,280
each other uh there's a lot of of uh

1220
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,559
confused talk there's a lot of of of the

1221
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,880
the the ziness I think of the show that

1222
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,400
I do and it's just myself I mean I'm

1223
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,440
doing five characters so I'm working my

1224
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,760
ass off you know and right yeah you know

1225
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,960
I'm I think I'm going to give myself a

1226
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,400
raise one of these days but idea that

1227
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,920
that right there when I heard the m

1228
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,520
of a fire sign theater I knew right away

1229
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,359
I wanted to do that you know um the rest

1230
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,920
of it is is strictly born of you know

1231
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,400
that's style you know that's that's

1232
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,079
style and that is something is is going

1233
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,319
to kind of exist but the rest of it is

1234
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,440
born of my own experience as a person

1235
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,640
you know um what I grew up with who I

1236
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,880
grew you know all these characters that

1237
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,119
I have reflect people that I knew in my

1238
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,520
life and uh you know but I fire sign

1239
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,720
theater is there first and foremost and

1240
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,040
then I would say Laurel and Hardy is in

1241
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,559
there and then I would say Lenny Bruce

1242
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,760
is in there and then I would say that

1243
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,160
um uh I can't say the money Python's an

1244
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,760
influence Because by the time I got into

1245
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,599
my professional world I think I was

1246
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,559
pretty

1247
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,480
well uh I

1248
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,480
formulated you know what I thought was

1249
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,319
funny or at least at least what was

1250
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,200
going to you know make me react and it

1251
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:53,200
just so happened when I discovered Monty

1252
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,359
Python I would say oh wow look at these

1253
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,119
guys are laughing at the same stuff I'm

1254
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:01,480
laughing at you know um I think the

1255
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,800
funniest guys in the world are

1256
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,680
three um well I would I would have to

1257
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,760
say yeah three of

1258
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,839
them right now for me are are John C

1259
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,119
Bill Murray and Fred Willard and they

1260
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:16,319
may be three wildly Divergent people you

1261
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:20,119
know but um they all deal with the same

1262
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:22,000
thing which is just the uh absolute

1263
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:25,240
hysterically um

1264
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,119
funny uh M and mundane world that we

1265
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,359
live in you know and and all the Char

1266
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,800
the characters those guys play are not

1267
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,960
highly charged political sure they're

1268
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,839
not playing they're not playing the

1269
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,800
dictator like Charlie Chaplain you know

1270
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,240
they're not prancing across the stage

1271
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,960
and bouncing the world on a ball they're

1272
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,079
they're on a golf course someplace yeah

1273
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,839
and they're they're they're they're

1274
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,480
they're a college professor throwing a

1275
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:49,440
guy through a window there are you know

1276
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,799
and Fred Willard with that marvelous uh

1277
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,040
I mean just you all you have to do is

1278
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:55,760
turn a switch on and Fred encapsulates

1279
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,200
everything phony about Television right

1280
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,359
uh personalities you know what he

1281
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:06,599
does so anyway you know that um

1282
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:08,319
um those three guys as well um sort of

1283
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,720
influence you know how I do things I'm

1284
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,559
not sure I answered your question but no

1285
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,599
no no you did you did we always Meander

1286
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,440
a little that's fine I think I think the

1287
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:19,760
other thing is that I'm absolutely

1288
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:23,640
sickened and fascinated and bored by and

1289
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:27,160
challenged by the flood

1290
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,799
of of the the the the the culture as it

1291
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,000
pounds its way into my living room every

1292
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:35,599
way every day by way of of Television um

1293
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,799
it's just just it's giving me um you

1294
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,599
know look uh we finally come to a point

1295
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:42,440
where some things can't be sazed you

1296
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,240
know that never happened in my life yeah

1297
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,079
what Westboro Baptist Church you cannot

1298
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,680
saiz that you know right uh Fred all of

1299
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,960
that [ __ ] it's just too weird so where

1300
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,400
do you go with with people like that

1301
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,400
right what do you go what do you do with

1302
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,799
that yeah and also do you how do you do

1303
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,240
it in that like what's the tone of doing

1304
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:04,200
it so that it's right because listening

1305
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,520
again if you listen to this you you the

1306
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,440
tone of fire sign doesn't the tone

1307
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,440
doesn't speak satire the content does

1308
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,839
the tone is like goofy acting like

1309
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,640
overacting in a lot of cases goofy like

1310
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,480
just

1311
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,520
ridiculous like not not intentionally

1312
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,079
off point sometimes where they're they

1313
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,480
sound like one guy might sound like he's

1314
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,640
reading where the other guy sounds like

1315
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,440
he's just it's it's a intentional mixed

1316
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,520
bag in the satire comes from that kind

1317
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,520
of disharmony like which is something I

1318
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,079
see what you're saying man you know what

1319
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,520
I mean like cuz a lot of times like oh

1320
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,599
really well isn't that but it's it's

1321
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,000
kind of like this old timey radio feel

1322
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,760
to it it's it's I could that's one thing

1323
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,599
about fire sign that like I can't Peg

1324
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,119
them I can't figure out what here's what

1325
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,960
I think is here's what I think is going

1326
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,880
on there I think it's it what I think is

1327
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,680
going on with fires sign theater is

1328
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,480
something that I I don't think can be

1329
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,400
done again and the reason is this what

1330
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:01,040
they had was suddenly

1331
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:04,440
an appetite a a there was a a market for

1332
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,440
or an audience for sending up the

1333
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,640
culture and and and commenting on the

1334
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,799
culture and the first thing that they

1335
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:16,720
thought to do was take this racist and

1336
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:18,599
warmongering and and uh you know

1337
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,200
classist society that we're living in

1338
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,559
and sexist society we're living in and

1339
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,480
comment on it using this other thing

1340
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:27,960
that we've got which was the TV and the

1341
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,839
radio of the time it was very much I

1342
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,880
married you I Love Lucy and it was all

1343
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,760
so let's go ahead and jam that into that

1344
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,680
because it was Radical and it seemed

1345
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,599
like you know the most effective way of

1346
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,400
of putting this mirror up to the world

1347
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,640
and say look at this we're going to put

1348
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,680
it through I Love Lucy it's kind of like

1349
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,720
you know uh Oliver Stone's Oliver

1350
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,400
Stone's hamfisted attempt there in

1351
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,520
Natural Born Killers where he has that

1352
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,280
sitcom of daddy you know molesting the

1353
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,319
little girl you know uh okay Oliver good

1354
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,119
for you man I I I got that one man a

1355
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,359
long time ago Dude you didn't really

1356
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:00,559
have to show that uh but at that time in

1357
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:02,680
in the 60s that's exactly what what was

1358
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,599
needed that's exactly how you should do

1359
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:09,520
it take that goofy asinine Hollywood

1360
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,599
Palace TV and thrust into it the uh

1361
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,040
Insanity of the world

1362
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,640
today we come from now we're 40 years

1363
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,680
after that and that's been done over and

1364
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,000
over and over and over again and now

1365
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,200
today you have a lot of thoughtful

1366
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,680
people like Louis CK mhm and there kind

1367
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,040
of thoughtful tight standup sets there

1368
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,720
wasn't a whole lot of theater going on

1369
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,880
out there and in terms of other than you

1370
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,640
know uh improv

1371
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:35,480
theater um because the zaniness man and

1372
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,880
the cookiness and the

1373
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,160
goofiness um is almost like not real

1374
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,559
enough I think we need to I think people

1375
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,960
want their comedy where you sit down and

1376
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,079
stare across the table and and say

1377
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,400
something really funny that's

1378
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,280
life-changing too yeah I was thinking

1379
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,599
kind of the same thing it's it's not

1380
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,760
it's not dissimilar to the way you know

1381
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,119
just straight up acting what we accept

1382
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,960
as acting has uh developed and also the

1383
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,040
fact that most movies now are based on

1384
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,520
something either that already exists or

1385
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,400
had to have happened in real life or we

1386
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:08,359
won't buy it which is so strange to me

1387
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,520
because that's that's like we we can't

1388
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:12,960
separate ourselves long enough to enjoy

1389
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,760
something unless it's super real which

1390
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,079
is not really the point well you know

1391
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,839
fiction um has taken a backseat to the

1392
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,680
documentary hasn't it and uh and and you

1393
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:26,119
know I I I had an acting teacher once

1394
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,680
who said to us uh it was after the

1395
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,359
challeng exploded mhm and it had been on

1396
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,640
television and they showed the mother

1397
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,920
and father of Christina Christine mlli

1398
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,920
who was the teacher it showed the mother

1399
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,640
and father and the reaction to that

1400
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,000
shuttle blowing up and the reaction they

1401
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,160
were smiling mhm they they didn't they

1402
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,520
didn't know what they were seeing they

1403
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,000
thought oh wow that that was interesting

1404
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,720
and I guess it's the second state and

1405
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,880
they continued to smile and only

1406
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,720
gradually did they look around them and

1407
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,040
see the other people reacting did they

1408
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,799
begin to the smile didn't disappear but

1409
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,119
now the worried edges around the eyes

1410
00:53:55,799 --> 00:54:00,040
began to appear and the sort the the

1411
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:01,960
mouth became tighter as they looked and

1412
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,640
they and and you could see them and and

1413
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,000
I remember my teacher a guy named darl

1414
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,799
Hickman saying that's the kind of acting

1415
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,200
you're going to have to do because

1416
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:11,040
that's what people are seeing people are

1417
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,119
more and more and more exposed to the

1418
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,920
real world so you can't you can't help

1419
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,359
it man you know I know what you're

1420
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,880
saying uh Jason I really do but the

1421
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,720
people out there have been exposed to

1422
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,520
God Almighty man look at the I mean

1423
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,920
you've we've seen it on TV a guy blowing

1424
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,000
his brains out on the freeway out here

1425
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,480
in the marina freeway see every kind of

1426
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,400
horrific violence you can dial up on

1427
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,640
YouTube um you so how can you do it any

1428
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,799
other way sure sure where if you're

1429
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,599
going to give people fantasy you have to

1430
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:41,240
connect it somehow it has to be a

1431
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,200
fantasy that's

1432
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,599
attainable that's that can happen you

1433
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,880
know if you're going to if you're going

1434
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,720
to write fiction it has to be fiction

1435
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,520
that resonates absolutely with the real

1436
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,760
best one of the best movies and I

1437
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,359
haven't heard anybody say this so this

1438
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,920
will be a new new one for you one of the

1439
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,280
best movies I've seen in the last five

1440
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,480
or six or seven years it's Michael

1441
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:03,119
Clayton George Clooney's movie about an

1442
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:07,079
attorney who's a fixer a guy that goes I

1443
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,520
loved it um is completely made up but

1444
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:13,440
somehow that man the struggles of his

1445
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,880
life the Loyalty he has to his friends M

1446
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,319
the the beauty of the writing and the

1447
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,240
acting was so relatable to me I I it

1448
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:23,200
could very well have happened sure you

1449
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,920
know uh because those performers carried

1450
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,920
it through for me so I let's let's put

1451
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,200
it this way whatever anybody is doing

1452
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,520
out there in art they got to be damn

1453
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:36,599
good for it to rise to the top oh yeah

1454
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,000
yeah absolutely and that that that gets

1455
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,440
to another one of my favorite speeches

1456
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,760
as long as I'm just hogging all this

1457
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,920
time here and Jason you're being so

1458
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:46,079
polite this poor guys listening to be we

1459
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,160
have lots and lots of paintbrushes and

1460
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,640
lots and lots of canvas and lots and

1461
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,799
lots of sketchbooks and lots and lots of

1462
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:58,359
of of uh pallets with paint but we still

1463
00:55:53,799 --> 00:56:01,880
only have one Rembrandt one Picasso and

1464
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:03,720
one Da Vinci and uh now we have lots and

1465
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,760
lots and lots of podcasts lots and lots

1466
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,200
of little video cameras lots and lots of

1467
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,160
YouTubes but there still is going to be

1468
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,599
a very limited number of real artists

1469
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,200
with those things you know like like

1470
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,760
Charles Bowski said you know God made

1471
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:21,480
many poets but not enough

1472
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:24,520
poetry you um I we need to you know kind

1473
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,799
of get get with that one man you know um

1474
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,960
there's a lot of noise out there right

1475
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:31,319
now sure lots of noise and uh somebody

1476
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,520
somewhere needs to shut up probably me

1477
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:36,400
all right what an

1478
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,160
outline well you're a good man for

1479
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,559
listening but no this is the kind of

1480
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,440
stuff that we like to do and Norm

1481
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:43,599
honestly if it wasn't you it would be me

1482
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,799
rambling about what I think art is about

1483
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,319
so I think people are sick of me saying

1484
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:49,599
it so it's good to have somebody else do

1485
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:51,160
it who you know it justifies all my

1486
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,799
[ __ ] thoughts it's good well I'm

1487
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,440
glad when you said a comedy album the

1488
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,839
first one that came to my mind was all

1489
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,319
hell lennin marks and Fire theater in

1490
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:01,480
general nothing else I I thought briefly

1491
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:04,319
about David fry and some of the other

1492
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,839
cats that influenced uh you know sort of

1493
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,000
made me laugh but these guys were it for

1494
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:11,119
me yeah if you're going to recommend

1495
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,640
this album I mean like I said I know you

1496
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,079
said the Nick danger thing was probably

1497
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,240
the thing that stuck out about this one

1498
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,280
if you're going to recommend this album

1499
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,760
to somebody or just recommend fire sign

1500
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,839
to somebody who hasn't heard of them or

1501
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,559
heard them how do you make them listen

1502
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:27,039
to

1503
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:30,520
it what would you say she

1504
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:32,680
this is the birth of modern satire I I

1505
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,319
that's you know that word satire what

1506
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,240
you got you you really got me in that

1507
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,200
one Jason because I I realize now the

1508
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,119
word satire means nothing to most people

1509
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,440
they don't know what it yeah people

1510
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:43,599
think that're just being funny as is

1511
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,520
satire um you know the best definition

1512
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,400
of satire I ever heard was Gary Trudeau

1513
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:52,000
said it was uh you know comedy with a

1514
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,000
point of view um I would

1515
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:58,599
say this is the birth of of Stoner humor

1516
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,480
list very true I yeah everybody who's

1517
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:02,839
ever turned me on to them I'm certain

1518
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,599
had to have heard them one time or

1519
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:05,720
another Stone yeah oh yeah absolutely

1520
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:07,680
there's no doubt now I was like well

1521
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,480
this is why you like that then cuz this

1522
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,119
I didn't get it you know just totally

1523
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,559
that that makes zero sense but it does

1524
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:15,280
it might take I don't I don't like to

1525
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,319
say that things are an acquired taste I

1526
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,359
think it's something where you just have

1527
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,680
to you have to just you just got to

1528
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,799
listen to it you just got to give it a

1529
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:25,720
shot yeah I think I think if people are

1530
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:28,119
interested in uh how things come about I

1531
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,280
think the birth of Stoner humor uh this

1532
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:32,799
is it man you can go and say well you

1533
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,440
know fire sign probably were influenced

1534
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:36,559
as as all of us were at one way or

1535
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,359
another by Lenny Bruce or or Lord

1536
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,359
Buckley or people like that but this

1537
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:43,160
here was the first

1538
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:46,240
mass-produced Stoner humor that your

1539
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:49,039
parents let you have not knowing really

1540
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,520
what it was absolutely oh that's nice

1541
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:53,359
there's car look at that that scratch

1542
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,240
your marks huh you know that's what they

1543
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,839
thought so I was actually going to ask

1544
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,599
about Buckley just given his you know

1545
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:04,520
both of your pensions for voice

1546
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,880
switching um I that might be a good

1547
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:09,240
