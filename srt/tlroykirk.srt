right here is made out of uh this is

105
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,840
made out of old Prince

106
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,960

purple and I don't know what the hell I

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,240
I always take them out and I burn

110
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,800
them and uh this is this is the material

111
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,800
I come up with is just kind of shoddy

112
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,400
little material here and U I got a lot

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,199
of stories I can tell you but oh here

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,199
here oh this is a scary one look at this

115
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
this scares the hell out of fish smaller

116
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,120
than this

117
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,600
you don't want any fish smaller than

118
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,520
this or otherwise you can't eat them uh

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,000
sometimes uh firsttime fishes are out

120
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,400
there and it's kind of a ride of patches

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we make them uh swallow any the first

122
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,440
fish they catch you know if it's small

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,160
enough and they they have to take their

124
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,720
pants off and they swallow this fish

125
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,120
hole and uh but anyway I'm off the track

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
here this is uh this is the scare away

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,240
of the very small fish it's a it's like

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,520
a lobster here a purple Lobster and they

129
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,280
they see that and they just head for the

130
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,800
hills and over here we got this is these

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,240

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,280
one anyway this is this is a leech uh

135
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,360

153
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,440
that's all they want to know about but

154
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,080
uh yeah I got some uh other fishing

155
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,639
stories too there was one day I was

156
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,039
fishing with my friend Wendell and we

157
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
were sitting in the boat we're sitting

158
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,280
in there and we've caught about our

159
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,479
limit more than our limit you know uh

160
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,840
anyway we're sitting there and uh just

161
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,120
getting kind of bored and everything we

162
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,680
didn't forgot forgot to talk for a while

163
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,160
so we decided to just have some fun

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,400
rocking the boat there all of a sudden

165
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,120
we're rocking and rocking and rocking

166
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,639
all a sudden both of us fall out we land

167
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,720
both into the lake there we're right in

168
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,560
the lake there can you see that we look

169
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,879
up there's fish in the boat and we're in

170
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,160
the

171
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,360
lake a that we we were just cracking we

172
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,319
were in the lake and the fish were in

173
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,360
the boat M you know it should be the

174
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,960
other way around should be always the

175
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,919
the other way around we were thicking at

176
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,120
at that time thought that was kind of

177
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,240
funny and uh yeah there's this other

178
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,840
time this uh this uh this this bear was

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,039
uh was uh out in the woods there was

180
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,000
running around and uh and we saw this

181
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,440
bear running around so we stayed out in

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,199
the

183
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,520
lake and there was this other time that

184
