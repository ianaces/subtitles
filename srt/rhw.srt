1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,359
this is lovely I'm feeling great tonight

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,080
very very good I hope you're feeling as

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,639
good as I am uh the reason I'm feeling

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,000
so good is uh I'm wearing

5
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:14,639
pants right now and that has not been

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,720
able to happen the entire time I've been

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,880
here I've had to wear like one pair of

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,400
shorts the whole time very quiet

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,080
everybody knows exactly what I'm talking

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,760
about it's very difficult this is a

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,119
beautiful place and it's a beautiful

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,439
place to come ruin clothes it really is

13
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,000
I've been looking at everything going

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,360
nope that's not going to that's not

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,719
going to work that's going to go away

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,360
very quickly that'll

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,800
deteriorate rapidly I will look like a

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,840
ghost pirate walking around the

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,960
beaches I don't know uh I'm worried that

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,840
some of you have seen me on a golf cart

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,760
driving around casting judging eyes at

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,120
me as I go by I feel like some of you I

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,239
might have seen you I try not to make

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,680
eye contact while I'm doing

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,480
it mainly because I'm worried that my

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,360
shorts will catch a breeze and then you

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,080
see stuff you don't want to see as I

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,640
drive by that's a very interesting kind

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,200
of driveby to

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
happen I will say uh if I come back

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,360
again one more important thing that I

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,799
need to pack is an entire suitcase of

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,600
Gold Bond uh body

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,920
powder that needs to be a

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,880
sponsor of the show is Gold

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,439
Bond if you go into my my bathroom right

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,520

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,119
referred to as a cocaine fight to the

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,360
death my entire bathroom is just covered

40
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:47,360
in a thin layer of white powder with

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Footprints leading away from the

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,680
scene I've I've given up on soap and

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,799
showering I just sort of rinse off one

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,439
layer of powder and then put on another

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,719
coat when I go home I'm going to have to

46
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,240
explain that to my wife the first time

47
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,360

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,200
right now they are not

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,080
haunted I don't know what I'm talking

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,640
about this is this is good though I feel

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,640
good I feel like I can wear these

56
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,560
clothes for a little while and then I'm

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,680

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,280

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,000
exotic place I've ever performed uh I

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,400
love it this is the most exotic comedy

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,120
show you can see or the most beautiful

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,599

right now to have this happen

74
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:12,319
again maybe a little less Gold Bond

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,080
but I like this and uh before I came on

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,840

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,640
have a there's a fire

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,040
extinguisher attached to the well to the

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,440
stone that the whole thing is made out

80
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,040

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,879
entire thing is made of

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,560
stone if there is a fire on this stage

86
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,920
