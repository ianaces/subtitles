1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
uh I've been trying to live healthier

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,520
lately as I age take care of myself yeah

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,360
I just don't want to end up like my dad

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,880
you know he's a diabetic he's a struggle

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,639
for years to try to keep his weight

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,240
under 300 pounds so he finally figured

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,279
out how to do it uh all he had to do was

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,279
amputate both of his

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,720
legs and he leveled out right at

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,720
297 like I don't know some of you got

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,759
tight on that don't worry he's thrilled

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,920
he finally reached he finally reached

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,640
his Target weight you know he's just 18

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,200
in short of his Target height but you

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,399
know you can't have

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,000
everything stillstone looks a horror

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,480
okay a couple of things I want you to

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,199
understand before I continue with my

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,440
closer uh number one this is not a

20
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,879
sudden tragedy don't feel too bad for my

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,800
dad he he literally had eight and a half

22
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,960
years notice to mix in a little light

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,120
cardio into the daily

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,680
routine yeah not pops he went a

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,000
different way uh he opted instead for

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,879
root beer floats and KitKat bars so I

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,879
say if the shoe

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,690
fits probably you probably still have

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,360
your feet bad bad bad stick around

30
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,960
[Applause]

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,159
um plus I I do want you to understand

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,600
this in all seriousness uh comedians

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,759
routinely use humor to deal with the

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,920
tragedy in our lives and I get my sense

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,240
of humor from my dad this is true uh

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,280
shortly after a second amputation the

37
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,280
two of us sat down and we wrote These

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,360
jokes together okay well I mean I chose

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,799
to sit he really had no other

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,799
option cuz that's how dad rolls

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,880
[Applause]

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,000
now and look it's a tough thing to joke

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,560
about I get it I understand it I see why

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,640
you're hesitant I and it's a big

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,479
adjustment for him I said hey Dad just

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,479
take it one step at a sorry I shouldn't

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,000
know

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,479
saying I do try to help him out though

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,640
go over and visit him all the time try

50
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,479
to keep his spirits up I uh I like to

51
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,880
put on a little sock puppet show for him

52
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,959
he's got a drawer full of things no

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,560
other goddamn

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,319

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,000
vegetables call that character Lamb Chop

56
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:22,440
he hates that

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,440
one can't stand it

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,959
um but I do I try to get him out of the

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,440

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,400
thought about it for a while he couldn't

63
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,400
come up with anything because he was

64
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,720
stumped so I took matters into my own

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,440
hands I signed him up for this amput

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,959
support group and in all seriousness

67
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,519
guys if you have a loved one in the same

68
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,400

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,560
kinds of activities and I signed him up

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,879
it was a speed dating thing I signed him

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,360

difference and uh you know Dad's always

77
