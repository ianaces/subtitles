is that it the theme of the show is

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,399
disappointment and that uh sometimes

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,439

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,960
night so uh uh yeah slightly built

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,560
35-year-old comedian uh suffers a

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,039
nervous breakdown on stage at the

103
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,320
Detroit Cav castle and is forced to move

104
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,080
home with her parents oh let's just say

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,120
that happened and uh I was doing my

106
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,080
hilarious comedy joke stories on stage

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,840
of the Detroit Comedy Castle and when

108
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,280

your level of frustration sir because

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,319
this is the problem with comedy clubs

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,479
cuz they just too vague in their

116
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,080
advertising they said we're going to be

going to go see that show and uh so

143
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:53,599
anyways so uh I did the rest of my Set

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,759
uh with tears coming slowly uh from my

145
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,800
eyes which is really quite funny in

146
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,879
retrospect and uh I I went back back to

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,199
the hotel and I did this weird thing I

148
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,199
was trying to write jokes but while I

149
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,960
did it I I heard this screaming and it

150
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,479
turns out it was coming from me and it

151
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,160
wouldn't stop for 10 minutes that was

152
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,080
kind of weird and uh so I decided I'm

153
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,400
going to take some time off go back to

154
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,520
duth uh to uh which is near uh Canada

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,879
where the kind of gentle people are and

156
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,000
um take an undisclosed amount of time

157
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,560
off just take a break and I was on my

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,360
way home and I was reading the Northwest

159
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Airlines inflight magazine where I get

160
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,520
most of my spirituality and uh I read uh

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,280
they did this study about happiness and

162
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,680
they said uh the variables in an

163
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,800
economic study uh that make people happy

164
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,080
are uh

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,440
relationships uh a mod come of food and

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,680
shelter and then uh some sort of safety

167
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,000
you know and then uh that money property

168
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,919
like stuff and uh Prestige or success

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,280
have no effect on people's level of

170
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,280
happiness and I thought oh my God I have

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,599
been totally focusing on the wrong

172
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,280
things I have gotten my priorities is

173
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,280
all screwed up I don't want to be

174
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,319
happy oh I want to be rich famous and

175
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,599
[Laughter]

177
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,520

you think I I I could be on TV yeah

712
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,119
anybody can be on

713
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,720
TV okay okay so here's my idea for a

714
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,240
show okay it's like it's like a cooking

715
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,639
show where you have like you know you

716
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,240
can see what they're doing right with

717
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,359
the mirrors and stuff and but then it's

718
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,200
like autopsies and it's like celebrity

719
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:30,800
autopsy so you have like charlon H movie

720
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,760
and then you take a clip and then you go

721
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,159
and here's his

722
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,760
liver

723
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,000
right that's that's an incredible idea

724
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,119
Sarah that's really that's really okay

725
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,639
so right okay so here's another one

726
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,399
coming at you so um I'm doing like it's

727
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,240
like a diet plan that you know people go

728
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,079
crazy for it's like you can have

729
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,879
whatever you want whatever you want but

730

Diet Pepsi is not okay no it is not and

950
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,040
I know you aren't making these decisions

951
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,559
it's the big wigs upstairs am I right

952
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,800
yeah and it's like they just you know

953
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,400
there is a big difference and I'm just

954
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,680
trying to protest here at the Grassroots

955
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:22,200
level then kind of shift the Paradigm

956
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,960
you know person by person but Diet Pepsi

957
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,839
is fine that's fine and uh I am on a

958
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,079
combination of the South Beach and

959
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:34,720
Weight Watchers and so I have six points

960
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:37,480
left and a fruit and uh so what what can

961
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,280

962
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:44,760
about a french fry or a curly fry listen

963
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,559

and that needs to be a fresh a Ramic a

967
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Ramic isn't that what you use in the

00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:03,880
industry Ramic of fresh raspberries okay

969
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,680

971
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,760
