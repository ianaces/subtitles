Rachel Bloom hello hi hi um so if you

69
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,599
don't know who Rachel is she uh was

70
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,480
quite famous for the video [ __ ] me Ray

71
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,360
Bradberry which uh I think got

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,720
everyone's attention including right

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,599
when did you get to meet

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,120
him at this point that would have been a

75
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,400
year and a half ago year and a half ago

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,000
yeah that was well a year yeah year and

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,519
a half ago yeah how was that it was

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,760
awesome it was great really in honor

79
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,640
he's one of my favorite authors

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,760
legitimately so that was great I don't

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,720
think you could make a song like that

82
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,319
unless you were genuinely a fan of those

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,360
no and I think that that song came from

84
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:45,560
like you know a genuine feel like a like

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,560
a genuiness of like not feeling like

86
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,840
modern pop songs were representing like

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,720
my romantic interest like it wasn't just

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,280
like it wasn't just like oh all these

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,200
like what's something that nerds like it

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,280
wasn't like that it was like it was like

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,920
I really like this I really love this

92
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,000
author I feel about in in ways that

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:08,799
other people feel about Thugs and you

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,799

this together love Janet uhoh it sounds

112
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,039
like Janet wanted more than friendship

113
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,160
and Mike was like oh Janet gave me a

114

115
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,800
bookstore Janet's crazy so sad maybe he

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,440
wasn't really into the whole SciFi

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,680
fantasy maybe Ray Bradberry [ __ ]

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
maybe you can make your inscription just

119
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,880
as depressing I'm going to do the exact

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,240
same inscription okay that way if people

121
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,240
see

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,400
this

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,560
Mike found this book at a used bookstore

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,319
you [ __ ] love

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,880
[Laughter]

126
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,319
Janet and Ary said that if she was able

127
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,120
to to make it she would have brought one

128
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,039
of our pets for you to sign oh man I

129
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,479
love signing pets

130
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
uh while while Rachel finishes that that

131
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,440
inscription we this week we're going to

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,840
be doing Weird Al even worse um and I

133
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,080
again I told Dan earlier I'm not sure

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,600
why I picked this one I think it's just

135
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,280
because we need to do more weird now

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,039
we've done two so far well I think I

137
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,840
requested I was like let's do comedy

138
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:52,240
music yeah so yeah it's one if it's more

139
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,360
not obscure but less listen to albums by

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
a at this point yeah yeah I I have to

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,000
say cuz I first started listening to we

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,639
all cuz my my mom had the giant like

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,919
compilation had this like multi-is set

144
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,520
but you know what really surprised me

145
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,639
about this album is um the songs that I

146
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,319
like the best were not the parodies were

147
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,960
his Originals I I he writes really

148
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,680
really good um you know original songs

149
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,319
like the the Melanie song is really cool

150
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,319
favorite it's really cool old days it's

151
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,599
super dark and good old days is also

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,240
really good I loved this song is just

153
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,039
six words long yeah that is great that's

154
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,280
a oh man look at this record this is

155
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,960
great that blew my mind it was So Meta

156
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,479
for me as a whatever I was 11 or 12year

157
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,440
old when I first heard it so it's it was

158
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,400
it's very that that one that song I'd

159
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,240
say is like the closest to like a song

160
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,560
of his being a sketch yeah totally true

161
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
which now you get so much in comedy

162
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,520
music it's like the sharpness of that um

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,599
yeah it was I was really like I really

164
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,039
want to go and listen to all alms and go

165
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,240
beyond the parody now and hear his

166
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,319
original stuff I I would like I've been

167
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,720
hoping to see them him rele or somebody

168
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,800
do like a tribute album where it's

169
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,560
people just covering all his Originals

170
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,440
because people people don't think of him

171
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,800
that way yeah which is depressing to me

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,479
because he's a wonderful songwriter yeah

173
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,479
yeah apparently stuck in a closet with

174
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,680
Vana White was his first original song

175
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,599
that was considered as popular by the

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,319
fans as his parodies really mhm which

177
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,879
one did you say was the experiment where

178
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,400
he wanted to see the good old days he

179
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,560
said was an experiment to see if he

180
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,680
could write a song where Charlie Manson

181
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,160
and James Taylor collaborated I love

182
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,520
that I love the unexpected of like

183
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,160
meanwhile I'd be torturing rats that's

184
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,720
such a great specific yeah I was reading

185
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,879
about him today and um apparently Prince

186
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
will never has never given a permission

187
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,720
you know weirdal doesn't need permission

188
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,280
right it's very specific parody laws

189
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,639
that say like you don't need but he gets

190
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,800
permission just to maintain Goodwill and

191
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,280
prince won't give him permission so he

192
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,280
won't do a Prince song but apparently

193
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,639
like he was doing some benefit and he

194
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,000
was going to sit in the same ride with

195
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,520
Prince and he got like a letter from

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,599
Prince's manager being like you do not

197
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
make eye contact with Prince oh my God

198
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
you do not look at Prince and he was

199
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,039
like holy [ __ ] yeah I know it's cuz

200
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,960
everyone else apparently Michael Jackson

201
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,440
was such a weird Al fan he like gave him

202
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,879
permission outright and actually the

203
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,319
music video for fat is shot in the same

204
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,520
set yeah as bat like that's amazing to

205
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,879
me brilliant lady you know there's yeah

206
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,800
there's also a thing where Lady Gaga

207
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,319
wouldn't give him the rights to Born way

208
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,720
thing I was remember reading about that

209
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,000
but apparently it wasn't her it was her

210
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,720
manager and then when she heard about it

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,199
she was like oh my God no of course I'm

212
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,960
a huge weird do fan which is so cool I

213
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,720
can't imagine her being

214
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,200
actual Diva actually made me happy for

215
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,080
Weird Al because he's talked about on

216
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,200
his blog how he's a big fan of Lady Gaga

217
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,200
he loves what she does he loves the

218
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,600
person that she is as an Entertainer

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,600
yeah and it really hurt him that she

220
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,160
quote unquote she responded that way

221
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,920

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,160
means first I'm going shopping in my

286
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,320
underwear then all of a sudden I'm

287
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,519
floating in that air my lips fall off

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,800
and everybody's on St donuts and hot

289
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,040
dogs are flying everywhere I to wait a

290
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,480
minute you ain't heard nothing

291
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,800
[Music]

292
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,800
yet next comes a part that I will never

293
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,160
forget now I'm being follow B these

294
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,040
fresh and spies they give me some velro

295
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,399
and an order of fries suddenly I'm

296
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,600
bowling on the Starship Enterprise I

297
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:53,360
fall down a hole and that's when I

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,360
realize I'm stuck in a closet with

299
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,240
white I'm stuck in a clet with B white

300
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,240
now

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,800
I loved hearing those two stalkery songs

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,760
though cuz like that's also my

303
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,760
sensibility like comedically also tends

304
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,160
to be kind of creepy and I think creepy

305
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,079
is like such a funny uh thing to do in

306
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,680
songs and like those two songs are so

307
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,959
they're so [ __ ] up also like like

308
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,600
everything else on the album is very

309
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,560
clean like even stuck in the closet with

310
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,560
Vanna White but like those two songs

311
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,360
like get dark and I love that and so

312
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,279
committed but most people nowadays they

313
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,240
just know how to write what they think

314
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,600
funny lyrics and there's there's a

315
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,160
there's a lack of commitment on the part

316
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,760
of the singer or the musician yeah

317
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,880
they're also not comedy those two songs

318
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,519
aren't like those two songs aren't like

319
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,279
uh I'm [ __ ] crazy like they don't say

320
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,680
they don't comment on what it is which

321
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,360
is a lot of problem with my with comedy

322
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,800
a problem I have a lot with comedy songs

323
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,519
sometimes is they tend to be

324
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,839
like me I'm crazy I don't know that's

325
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,560
the only little too self-aware of their

326
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,639
situation real crazy people are not

327
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,079
self-aware they don't think they're

328
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,959
crazy what they're doing right that's

329
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,920
the problem I have with political comedy

330
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,760
songs a lot is it's very hard not to be

331
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,199
like like I hear a lot of political

332
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,199
comedy songs that'll be like I'm Sarah

333
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:12,160
Palin and I'm [ __ ] insane it's like

334
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,320
well Sarah Palin wouldn't wouldn't say

335
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,000
that she she would probably feel very

336
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,199
Justified and like one part like going

337
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,199
with the whole commitment and not

338
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,800
knowing that you're crazy is in Melanie

339
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,680
he says how she won't answer her her how

340
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,480
she ignores his phone calls so he has to

341
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,519
dig through a trash to learn about it

342
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,639
yeah I love that lyric and he's pissed

343
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,440
that she's doing this to him like you're

344
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,440
making me dig through your trash to find

345
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,079
out about you that's not right um answer

346
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,839
my crazy insane calls please yeah and

347
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,880
you know lately I've been because I've

348
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,880
been writing like just the past few the

349
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,760
past like two months or so I've been

350
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
doing like I have two new music videos

351
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,120
coming out like that are done and I have

352
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,680
another one that I'm filming on Thursday

353
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,839
and like I've been really I've been

354
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,519
really realizing that rhyming is very

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,440
hard to make funny uhhuh uh but I

356
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,399
laughed out loud in Melanie when he

357
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,560
Rhymes when he basically he reveals like

358
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,360
I wouldn't have gotten know you for for

359
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,279
that telescope and Telescope I forget

360
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
what what L doesn't rhyme but but it's a

361
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,920
rhyming lyric and it's funny which I

362
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,800
think rhyming funny

363
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,800
lyrics can be like very I don't know

364
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,399
it's hard they're hard to do cuz like

365
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,720
you expect what's coming and like

366
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,680
there's a risk in it sounding cute and

367
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,240
yeah that's so true you know how do you

368
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,600
um that's actually a really good point

369
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,079
uh how I mean I know why I mean I think

370
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,600
we all know why he's lasted but I mean a

371
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,320
guy who who starts out and comes across

372
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,680
as a novelty for the first few years

373
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,240
he's out like you can't deny his power

374
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,000
at this point but what the [ __ ] does a

375
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,040
man do like that to stay alive like I

376
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,279
don't know how he stays relevant other

377
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,360
than being up on what's cool you know

378
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,560
well I mean I mean he he has faded

379
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,240
though a little you know I mean I think

380
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,279
he has like a bit of a Resurgence when

381
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,920
like when he did like perform this way

382
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,320
and he's been doing stuff lately but

383
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,279
like you know his Heyday was definitely

384
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,680
I would say the late 80s or 90s probably

385
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,240
right yeah but I mean no not few people

386
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,199
can stick around for 30 years and still

387
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,800
be good and still be writing good music

388
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,800
I I feel as as like again somebody who

389
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,759
was in novelty quote unquote right well

390
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,680
I think part of it too is that you know

391
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,120
he was smart with his money and now he

392
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,639
has his own Studio that's true and he

393
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,279
produces he produced for Ben Folds right

394
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:28,279
that's true he produces real

395
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:30,399
music he produced the um uh that one y

396
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,079
the one song Silverman that one or no

397
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,399
the the the first one he just been full

398
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,319
Rock the suburbs Rock he produced Rock

399
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,399
in the suburbs if you watch the video

400
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,920
he's in the booth playing with the no I

401
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
knew that I didn't know that but that's

402
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,120
because he produced it oh my God his

403
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,440
Studio that's one of my favorite albums

404
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,040
yeah I love Ben Folds that's awesome

405
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,600
have you and actually his recent Ben

406
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,600
Folds uh Style parody is pretty good and

407
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,639
Ben fold plays piano on it too right I

408
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,480
think that might be the third time we've

409
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,279
said this on the podcast but that just

410
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,839
and um the most recent new Hansen song

411
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,560
yeah produced by weird album he's in the

412
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,000
video as well playing the tambourine

413
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,720
what a good guy he's so nice what a good

414
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,959
guy that's that's the good thing about

415
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,800
his parodies too is like especially in

416
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,199
fat it's like it's it's not just like a

417
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,959
it's not making fun of Michael Jackson

418
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,440
it's using the genre to make a new song

419
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:21,120
which is always the best Ty type of

420
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:25,519
parody yeah exactly I love Ham on ham on

421
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,000
H oh it's so smart that's so smart when

422
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,920
I heard that I was like oh of course Ham

423
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,920
on

424
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,440
there was no other thing it could have

425
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,639
been oh it was so great oh it's so funny

426
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,160
and I think one of my other I didn't

427
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,120
like because I you know I back in the

428
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,199
Heyday of N I downloaded a lot of Weird

429
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,800
Al songs and I didn't know what most

430
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,399
most of them were from cuz it was just

431
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,120
like did a search for Weird Al you know

432
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,040
you end up with some of the not Weird Al

433
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,480
songs as well the vagina song and such

434
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,000
and such got the wrong foot amputated

435
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,839
Weird Al would really do that but you

436
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,399
know now like just looking at this I

437
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,680
didn't realize how many of my favorite

438
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,240
songs are actually on this album cuz I

439
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,280

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,799
terrible terrible puns that are

mean you know Melanie and good old well

448
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,480

449
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,520
just like silly balls yeah

450
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,200
yeah do you when did you I don't know

451
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,480
when did you start doing funny music

452
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,720
um well you know it was kind of this

453
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,120
like trajectory like I was I started out

454
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,320
as a big big musical theater kid okay

455
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,200
and I knew I liked writing but it wasn't

456
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,000
until uh I was a musical theater major

457
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,240
in college and then I got to college and

458
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,720
simultaneously I got into a sketch group

459
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,600
okay so I started doing sketch and then

460
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,360
separately I started taking classes in

461
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,000
like musical theater writing okay and I

462
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,400
would gear I started writing kind of

463
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,480
comedic musical theater songs but it

464
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,640
wasn't really until I graduated from

465
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,559
college and I started writing um because

466
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,159
I wanted to get a show up at the Upright

467
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,200
Citizens with theater just like a sketch

468
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:15,000
show that I would write and star in and

469
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,720
um and I thought of an idea actually

470
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,480
this is I haven't thought of this I

471
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,120
originally it was a sketch show that

472
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,480
took place within the context of the

473
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,320
Broadway show a course line so it's like

474
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,120
a confessional of a of a fake character

475
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,400
and every sketch would be but but then I

476
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,960
realized oh if I'm doing a sketch of

477
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,840
that takes in a CH line I should write a

478
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,520
musical sketch and I and I thought of a

479
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,679
a musical idea of a song for a song

480
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,039
about the movie Space

481
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,480
Jam uh which is actually currently in my

482
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,679
one person show it used to be and it's

483
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,880
called and it takes basically it's like

484
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,000
a person in a chus line and someone says

485
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,880
to them uh what tell us an important

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,919
story about why you became a dancer and

487
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,000
it and the song is like I love the movie

488
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,280
Space Jam and it's all and and and it

489
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,880
it's revealed that Space Jam actually

490
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,240
basically this frivolous song That Just

491
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,240
describes the plot of the movie Space

492
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,400
Jam and then finally the director's like

493
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,039
stop stop wh why are you singing about

494
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,919
why is Space Jam so important to you and

495
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,480
then the end of the song is like when I

496
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,760
was five my daddy left my mom was

497
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,919
addicted to Coke and it was just it's

498
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,679
just dark story and it was like I was

499
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,039
about to kill myself when suddenly I saw

500
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,799
the poster for Space Jam and I realized

501
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,840
if Looney Tunes can play basketball who

502
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,520
says I can't quit drugs and it like ties

503
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,880
back so that's really that's really

504
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,080
actually the first comedy song I wrote

505
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,320
and my friend Mikey wrote the music for

506
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,640
it it was brilliant and I remember

507
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,240
hearing it and being like oh this is

508
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,360
like really fun I mean and that's at

509
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,080
this point 2 years ago it's been very

510
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,880
recent that I've just combined I mean

511
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,240
the musical the love of like kind of

512
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,679
musical stuff with cuz you know

513
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,760
especially being like a musical theater

514
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,840
major and then being in a comedy group

515
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,640
MH I feel like I often heard from

516
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,080
friends like so when are you going to

517
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,000
decide like when are you going to choose

518
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
whether to do like the musical stuff and

519
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,840
that included like musical theater

520
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,440
writing like when you going to choose to

521
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,840
do the musical route or like the comedy

522
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,720
route and like you don't necessarily

523
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,840
have to no no so but then in that case

524
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,480

at Cole Porter but uh you you listen to

539
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,400
like a Cole Porter song and actually

540
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,760
Steven sonheim just released a book uh

541
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,679
he just released a series of two books

542
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,679
where he analyzes like his own lyrics

543
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,240
and other people's lyrics it's amazing

544
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,280
it's called finishing the hat and look I

545
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
made a hat and he talks about how he

546
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,440
talks about comedy songs in it briefly

547
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,760
and he says Cole Porter is clever he's

548
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,159
not funny because it's word play and I

549
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,120
felt like that's a lot of Comedy songs

550
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,360
in musical theater it's very clever

551
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,240
whereas like weird out especially in

552
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,480
like this song's just six words long or

553
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,080
Melanie it's not clever it's not playing

554
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,440
with words it's not trying to do riddles

555
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,159
it's just like this is the joke here is

556
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,240
my joke and I feel like that's so

557
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,000
important when I got when I started

558
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,880
doing sketch comedy my sense of humor

559
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,799
changed cuz I thought a ton of musicals

560
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,840
were funny and then the second I started

561
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,120
doing actual real comedy I was like oh

562
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,679
this isn't musicals like yeah a lot of

563
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,799
them aren't funny this is this is how

564
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,919
you do you know jokes and [ __ ] think I'm

565
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,400
a clone now is actually closer to the

566
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,400
clever as opposed to funny cuz it is and

567
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,120
and and weird has a lot of and weirdo

568
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,240
has a lot of uh clever and he does have

569
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:44,840
a lot of cute and uh and but what I like

570
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,600
I mean you know fat is like clever but

571
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,559
the jokes in it are so blatant it's not

572
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,240
I don't know it's like not cute to me

573
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,440
it's great like there's something about

574
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,400
just like he go he commits so hard and

575
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,760
the jokes are so just blatant out there

576
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
the there's nothing koi about it that's

577
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,919

they their songs are great because they

631
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,919
take that the the best of their songs

632
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,200
take the like kind of 1940s cute genre

633
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:34,120
and then something very not cute with it

634
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,880
mhm which I love it's hard to do that

635
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,440
right too it's hard to balance that cuz

636
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,960
there's I mean there's guys like what's

637
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,399

etc etc and after two songs he's done it

642
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,159
yeah I get it whereas opposed to

643
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,559
somebody like Toby hus does a Rudy C

644
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,840
which is supposed to be Frank Sinatra's

645
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,520
bastard love child and [ __ ] sounds

646
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,760
exactly like Frank Sinatra and also

647
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,240
things about filthy filthy filthy yeah

648
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,720
yeah amazing um did you one thing that

649
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,080
we kind of discuss a lot like Dan and I

650
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,320
grew up listening to Weird Al it's kind

651
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,240
of what we became friends over um did

652
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,200
you have is there any music or comedy

653
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,440
that you grew up like was there anything

654
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,399
that you have had like a personal

655
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,039
connection to like that or maybe you you

656
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,640
grew to know somebody better listening

657
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:24,520
to Comedy or watching comedy or whatever

658
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,760
oh um did I bond with friends I'm trying

659
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,399
to think cuz you know growing up the

660
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,279
this is what it is is MHM it wasn't

661
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:35,159
until like my senior year in high school

662
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,320
that I became friends with the people

663
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,600
who were listening to Comedy okay I was

664
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,039
previously more friends with like drama

665
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,600
geek like so we I mean I when I say like

666
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,440
I'm still behind on music because all I

667
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,799
did was listen to show tunes so I I

668
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,080
loved comedy and I loved SNL uh I just I

669
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,320
didn't have friends who were like into

670
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,480
comedy I had friends who were like into

671
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,120
show tunes a ton so like I bonded on

672
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,760
that like you know like when I say

673
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,760
artists I bonded on like Steven sonheim

674
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:09,559
was by far like the thing that I like

675
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,679
he's that that artist is like is the

676
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,880
thing I grew up with but like I wish I

677
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,000
wish that I had more of a childhood

678
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,039
connection to Comedy stuff because I

679
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,440
loved

680
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,000
comedy I just listened to show tunes so

681
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,480
much it kind of eclipsed you know like I

682
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
wish I'd watched I didn't start watching

683
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
Mr show until college and you know the

684
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,279
same with like Ben Stiller show Dan car

685
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,760
to a lot of those too wish I hadn't been

686
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,679
because I mean I remember when I have

687
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,159
like my interview for my college sketch

688
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,559
group you know they were like who do you

689
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,640
who are your comedic Idols you know I

690
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,480
said like Gilda rner as every girl does

691
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,200
because and I really do love her and

692
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,360
then I said George Carlin cuz actually

693
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,919
yes George Carlin I would say I don't

694
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,320
know if I necessarily bonded with anyone

695
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,480
on it because again I felt like I was

696
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,720
the only one listening to Comedy until a

697
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,600
certain point when I was like 17 or 18

698
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,760
but uh my parents had had uh was it

699
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,080
Napal and silly putty first okay anyway

700
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,559
my parents had one of their books one of

701
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,840
his books and I started reading it and I

702
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,679
thought it was [ __ ] amazing and now I

703
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,080
have all his books and then I saw him do

704
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,840
standup Live Twice once in high school

705
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,080
once in college so I would say he's the

706
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,600
comedian um who who I kind of fell in

707
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,159
love with but I was late to the game you

708
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,279
know I knew I liked comedy it was just

709
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,159
that I liked comedy in from a very big

710
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:29,080
musical theater standpoint and I just

711
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:31,120
didn't I was so busy you know memorizing

712
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,159
Gypsy that I like never really got into

713
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,559
comedy until like late High School like

714
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,640
I remember the first time I read the

715
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,760
onion which was my junior year of high

716
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,919
school and my mind was blown I was like

717
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,440
oh my gosh I didn't realize things could

718
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,440
be this smart this is so cool yeah like

719
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,279
yeah well I mean it obviously hasn't

720
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,519
hurt because what you're doing is I mean

721
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,360
you're doing so much comedy now and

722
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,519
people are respecting your work so

723
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,919
that's matter it's wonderful and the

724
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,399
show that I have running at UCB right

725
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,919
now is very it's a it's a it's an

726
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,919
actor's desperate musical theater

727
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,440
showcase so it's it's Musical Theater

728
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,080
comedy songs very specifically and yeah

729
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,320
no I don't and when I I mean when I got

730
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,480
into college I actually very much

731
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,720
disliked being musical theater major so

732
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,080
I really flung myself into my sketch

733
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,080
group sure to the point where I would

734
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,720
say that I really majored in sketch

735
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,919
comedy in college CU because it was a we

736
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,519
put up a show once a month it was like I

737
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,480
was making up for lost time that's what

738
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,840
college that's what college was for me

739
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,799
it was like it was like 18 years of like

740
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,600
sort of like definitely knowing I should

741
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,440
like comedy but like focusing on musical

742
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,480
theater stuff and like not having room

743
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,320
for the two and then like in four years

744
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,880
fitting in like kind of trying to play

745
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,919
katchup and being like Oh my God yes and

746
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,840
like writing you know two sketches a

747
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,320
week just like really trying

748
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,440
to catch up with everyone else now was

749
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,080
was the the theater thing uh just your

750
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,880
own thing or is it from your parents

751
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,799
like no it's my own thing yeah yeah

752
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,320
totally uh my parents are very very

753
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,760
great that they always supported me

754
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,559
being in the Arts I always knew I wanted

755
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,080
to be in the Arts I was very much like

756
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,440
the little kid who was like always going

757
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,840
around singing I was like the lead in I

758
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,000
was I was I was very committed to being

759
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,159
um a musical theater actress growing up

760
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,519
I mean I I you know I was very that

761
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,200
music video I steal pets I didn't steal

762
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,919
pets necessarily but uh when I was in

763
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,960
sixth seventh grade I was tortured it

764
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,760
was it was awful I was really made fun I

765
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,120
mean it was it was really really bad and

766
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,000
I kind of immersed myself further into

767
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,559
like taking singing lessons and dancing

768
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,360
lessons

769
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,600
um so you can relate yeah yeah yeah it

770
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,679
was I would say that I would say that

771
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,240
every and and the reason I like comedy

772
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,080
songs is very much comedy still feels

773
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,000
very Escapist for me sure it's very much

774
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,440
like like I love High

775
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,039
premise stuff you know like I it's also

776
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,880
the way I learn sketch but like like I'm

777
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,200
very much more likely to write a sketch

778
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,760
about about like time traveling dicks

779
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,799
than like the intricacies of than just

780
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,279
sitting down and talking about cheese

781
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,760
you know like high premise stuff makes

782
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,880
much more sense to me because that's

783
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,840
where I'm coming it's the same it's the

784
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,000
same like place in my mind like I'm

785
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,320
really into like you know Science

786
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,120
Fiction and Fantasy and like that love

787
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,480
is the same area in my mind as like

788
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,440
musical theater it's like all Escapist

789
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,000
for me sure I mean and that's probably

790
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,640
the healthiest way to approach it it

791
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,960
it's way healthier than I'm in it for

792
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,519
attention which I you know you're

793
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,799
running I think I think that's why I

794
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,279
went all into sci-fi fantasy 2 spending

795
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:41,159
you know 12 hours a day reading you know

796
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,480

good looking for some it's about it's

802
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,039

00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,760
Behavior magnified a thousand times and

816
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,480

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,279
Comedy that I I I I can't can't quite

sketches like he and I wrote my friend

844
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,159

894
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,399
had a dream about a wall of dicks you

895
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,119
know it's a recur dream that I have a

896
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,599
lot that I mentioned in the sketch I

897
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,520
have a recurring dream a lot where I

898
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,240
have to go to the bathroom really badly

899
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,399
like in real life I probably have to pee

900
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,159
sure and in the dream the only toilet is

901
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,760
like in the center of a room full of

902
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,639
people like I had that dream I had that

903
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,399
dream repeatedly where I have to poop in

904
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,560

913
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,200
preschool I went to monor and I didn't

914
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,200
realize this was weird until years later

915
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,720
there are no it's just a row of toilets

916
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,880
in these really progress really

917
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,000
Progressive preschools you go into the

918
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,920
and this is when you're no four years

919
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,880
old right you go into this um there are

920
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,520
no it's just toilet toilet toilet

921
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,359
there's no stalls so you're [ __ ]

922
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,839
next to some next to a boy who's peeing

923
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,040
couldn't handle that like I definitely

924
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,640
be I remember like taking shits while

925
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,839
like my friend who was a boy had his

926
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,680
dick out and was like peeing in the

927
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,480
toilet next to me I don't remember the

928
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,400
bathrooms of my preschool but I'm pretty

929
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,599
sure it was just like a oneoff like

930
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,359
there's only one toilet well that's it

931
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,040
was a small had M Small Town they would

932
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,320
invested in more toilets and not walls

933
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,760
though I think yeah I I like thinking

934
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,240
about it

935
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,839
now thinking it you know I can't say cuz

936
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,800
I'm very progress and I I love that that

937
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,520
was Li you know I was raised like very

938
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,440
openly about sex and stuff and like but

939
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,359
like I think that's where those

940
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,839
nightmares most it's not even nightmares

941
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,480
I never wake up in a cold sweat it's

942
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,839
just weird dreams I I'm never scared

943
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,520
like the dreams aren't me like oh I

944
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,760
can't [ __ ] it's it's more being like

945
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,400
really are you sure you don't have a

946
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,079
toilet that's like in a stall and

947
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,240
they're like nope nope you just have to

948
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,200
[ __ ] in this toilet on the spaceship in

949
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,599
front of the commander of the spaceship

950
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,920
so I think that's where that dream must

951
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,880
come from is remembering having having

952
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,079
watching you while you're [ __ ] yeah

953
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,079
I also didn't go poop in the toilet

954
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,200
without a diaper until I was four years

955
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,400
old so do you feel that that maybe the

956
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,960
toilet is where your acting need comes

957
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,359
from you have to be in front of people

958
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,760
no okay good no I was going to say we

959
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,720
might need to to to dissect this I think

960
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,880
they're separate I think I just I I grew

961
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,640
up with so I think I just as a kid had

962
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,599
so many personal issues about pooping

963
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,000
and Afraid the toilet was going to eat

964
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,319
me and you know like anyway sorry you're

965
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
supposed to be talking about even worse

966
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:03,240
I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that talking

967
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,200
about you having to poop in front of a

968
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,920
ton of people is even worse I guess yeah

969
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,640
I had a actually had a dream right after

970
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,119
I had not has nothing to do with pooping

971
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,400
it's it's a preschool dream uhhuh uhuh

972
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,240
and I think I had it once more years

973
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,720
later but I only vaguely remember it and

974
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,599
it was right after I graduated preschool

975
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,359
MH we had a play school castle and a

976
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:28,040
Play-Doh monster ate everybody that's

977
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,520
scary you have some [ __ ] weird

978
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,240
stories and dreams from when you were a

979
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,000
kid man that's going to be and I think

980
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:37,040
it was I think it was because you know I

981
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,359
didn't want to leave yeah cuz it was it

982
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,440
is right after I graduated you think do

983
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,040
you think the Playdoh monster

984
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,359
represented like

985
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,640
adulthood swallowing you up into adult I

986
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:48,640
think it was Play-Doh okay all right

987
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,160

988
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,160

1000
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,160
dreams involving like torture oh my God

1001
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,560

1002
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,119
ever had I had a dream this was at the

1003
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,480
height of me being upset I had a dream

1004
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,440
that aliens came to Earth and they like

1005
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,040
projected in the sky it almost looked

1006
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,839
like a DVD menu but instead of a DVD

1007
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,800
menu it was like ways were going to

1008
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:41,200
destroy

1009
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,640
you and you had to choose and and in the

1010
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,960
and basically then the aliens um

1011
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,720
projected this message that was like

1012
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,400
here's the deal we are going to give

1013
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,040
everyone on Earth an hour to kill

1014
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,359
themselves whoever isn't dead in an hour

1015
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,599
we're going to kill you and it's going

1016
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,960
to be really painful so you have the

1017
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,079
choice to kill yourself really pain LLY

1018
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,720
now or like wait for us to do it but by

1019
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,200
way you're going to die so then it was

1020
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,160
this dream about everyone going off to

1021
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,480
commit suicide God and um oh my God it

1022
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,280
was really dark and I walked into like a

1023
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,560
room where everyone and there were all

1024
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
and some people were putting their heads

1025
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,280
in ovens and then there were like a row

1026
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,599
of sinks where everyone was like

1027
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,680
slitting their wrists [ __ ] it was the

1028
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,560
most [ __ ] up dream I've ever had but

1029
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,200
it was a really good premise for a short

1030
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:27,400
story or something movie right there you

1031
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,960
rbbery about that no I didn't should

1032
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,280
Steve K yeah have you seen the trailer

1033
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,800
for Seeking a Friend for the End of the

1034
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,800
World oh my God I saw it yes that looks

1035
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,319
so good kind of a romantic comedy but

1036
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,520
there's an asteroid that's coming to

1037
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:43,640
Earth that's going to destroy everybody

1038
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,480
and their last attempt to stop it failed

1039
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,920
all right and they're like we're

1040
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,880
definitely going to die in three weeks

1041
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,760
awesome it I I want it to be really good

1042
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,359
I I hope so I just want Steve Carell to

1043
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,160
have a good Steve's going to Steve

1044
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:57,520
Carell is looking for the one that got

1045
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,960
away yeah yeah and Kieran nightly is

1046
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,119
like an Australian

1047
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,839
accent I thought she was just being Kira

1048
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,359
nightly yeah I don't know I can't

1049
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:06,000
remember where she's from is she from

1050
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,480
Australia maybe she is from the Moon

1051
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,760
wait she's but she she wants to go back

1052
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,040
and see her family she doesn't think

1053
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,880
she'll see so they travel together to do

1054
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,400
that and I'm going to guess they end

1055
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,119
it's a road trip movie it's a road trip

1056
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,599
mover movie through an apocalypse I hope

1057
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,400
that the movie ends I hope that the end

1058
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,960
of the movie isn't somehow that there's

1059
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,839
no asteroid or the asteroid no I want

1060
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,560
the asteroid hit it has got has to right

1061
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:29,839
I hope I feel like that would negate a

1062
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,760
lot of the movie if it doesn't it

1063
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,599
absolutely would but that's Hollywood so

1064
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,160
God damn well this is the way it could

1065
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,480
work the interesting thing about that is

1066
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,280
like psych there was never an asteroid

1067
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,480
and you realize like oh I just had a

1068
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,720
really great time only when I thought I

1069
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,480
was about to die should we all live our

1070
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,000
lives like we're about to die what about

1071
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,160
all those people like Pat oswal who's

1072
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,800
been banging all these chicks without

1073
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,160
protection he was saying he does they

1074
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,040
don't care they're going to All Die oh

1075
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,000
yeah that line where he's like they

1076
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,280
don't care if you're related they just

1077
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,920
don't care

1078
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,640
yeah I feel like if the asteroid doesn't

1079
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,079
exist there's the world after the

1080
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,040
asteroid is going actually going to be a

1081
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,720
terrible place that's a funny movie idea

1082
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,800
the aftermath of everyone thought the

1083
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,040
world was going to end and then it

1084
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,280
didn't and you have to deal with the

1085
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,760
fact they having like your brother's

1086
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,359
baby and

1087
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,720
[ __ ] damn it I love uh post-apocalyptic

1088
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:23,520
stuff I think apocalyptic question no

1089
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,079
I've not had a dream like that but I've

1090
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,079
had some very depressed dreams so I can

1091
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,920
totally relate okay I had I haven't I

1092
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,599
haven't had one that good I would have

1093
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,760
really have been entertained by that

1094
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,800
dream yeah I I wasn't necessarily even

1095
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,480
scared I during the mo during you think

1096
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,119
even during the dream as I was terrified

1097
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,400
in the dream I was like this is [ __ ]

1098
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,400
cool and it's also that thing that's

1099
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,560
also the thing in the dream you know

1100
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,920
like sometimes when you have very

1101
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,839
cinematic dreams you kind of know you're

1102
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,000
in a movie so there's a little bit

1103
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,680
that's emotionally removed yeah there

1104
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,800
was one yeah I love dreams I have I have

1105
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,160
a recurring dream holy [ __ ] this is or

1106
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,720
at least recurring it's not even a Rec

1107
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,119
recuring Dream It's a recurring set in a

1108
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,400
dream where it's like a cabin in the

1109
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,880
middle of a swamp like a broken down

1110
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,880
cabin and then inside there's like a

I was really young my again my my

1143
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,760
parents you know I would say the people

1144
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,480
I knew who were most into comedy are

1145
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,800
probably my parents like even though I

1146
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,760
hung out with drama NS my my parents

1147
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,319
like I watched all the like classic

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,720
sitcoms with them like I watched

1149
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:39,800
Seinfeld and like uh like my mom would

1150
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,200
tape all the shows from the week on a

1151
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,800
VHS and at the end of the week we'd

1152
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,359
watch them all so we'd watch like

1153
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,160
Seinfeld Mad About You Frasier it's a

1154
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,800
DVR but it's like the old fashioned yeah

1155
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,000
uh and then my mom

1156
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,280
had this giant Weird Al CD compilation

1157
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,200
and I just remember listening to it the

1158
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,040
I remember you know I remember seeing

1159
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,880
eat it for the first time and just

1160
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:06,760
thinking like my mind was blown yeah

1161
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,760
yeah I was like

1162
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,090
[Music]

1163
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,040
food isn't it

1164
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:32,520
strange feels like I'm looking in the

1165
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,760
mirror what would people

1166
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,680
say if only they knew that I was part of

1167
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,280
some geneticist

1168
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,720
plan born to be a carbon copy

1169
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,119
man there in a p tree dish late one

1170
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,160
night they took a donor's body sell and

1171
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:54,440
fertilized a human egg and so I say I

1172
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,960
think I'm a clone now there's always to

1173
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:02,599
of me just a hanging around

1174
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,079
I think I'm a now every chromosome is a

1175
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,000
heavy

1176
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:11,440

1178
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,240

00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,680
oh it was pretty late it was on MTV yeah

1180
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,359
when he you know whenever he was

1181
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,839
whatever album he was promoting at the

1182
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,400
time you know cuz he always did LTV yeah

1183
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,079

probably in Germany sometime that I

1189
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,680
heard it the first like cuz I think we

1190
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,200
rented one of his video compilations in

1191
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,240
Germany I I grew up my for four years I

1192
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,359

00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,920
military so oh cool I got all of my

1194
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,760
American pop culture one or two years

1195
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,240
too late so I was way late to the game

1196
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,960
on a lot of stuff all my Golden Girls

1197
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,760
episodes were a year too late that's

1198
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,520
hilarious wait you grew up in JY when

1199
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,280
you were a kid so that would have been

1200
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,000
when were you you were in Berlin were

1201
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,440
you uh no I was I was in West Germany I

1202
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,200
was in you know the on the American side

1203
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,839
was just before I think we left two

1204
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,119
years before the wall fell as it were I

1205
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,119
consider myself responsible okay good

1206
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:15,359
job that's just how that goes thank you

1207
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,520
Dan that's really cool wow but yeah so I

1208
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,720
think that's the first time but it was

1209
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,000
on it I think I saw his videos first and

1210
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,640
I think it was very funny that he did he

1211
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,160
eat Harvey the one Wonder hamster in one

1212
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,720
of those or did he throw him I think he

1213
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,040
puts him in his mouth and think he does

1214
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,839
okay that could be what it is but that's

1215
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,400
the first time I ever heard and then it

1216
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:33,760
wasn't until years later that Dan and I

1217
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,079
became friends over this stuff so I'm

1218
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,040
just always curious so your mom was

1219
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,520
really cool if she had all the weird owl

1220
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,880
stuff on yeah they they really my

1221
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,599
parents really appreciate comedy um but

1222
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,040
they didn't necessarily expose you to it

1223
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,880
like they didn't like say you have to

1224
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,680
listen to this no well because also it's

1225
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,520
not like they grew up it was very recent

1226
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,680
you know like they would have I mean

1227
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,400
when I was exposed to it it would have

1228
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,119
only been a few years so it wasn't like

1229
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,960
it wasn't like the Beatles or you know

1230
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:59,880
it but but no no it was very much like

1231
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,680
also it was clean so you know I mean

1232
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,040
this whole album is very clean album

1233
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,839
it's it's you know it doesn't have curse

1234
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,559
words or no and I want to say that I

1235
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,240
just we were watching TV also one time

1236
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,599
we saw eat it and maybe that's why my

1237
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,240
mom got the albums but either way I

1238
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,200
think I remember seeing the music video

1239
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,040
for eat it first actually and then you

1240
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,440
know I think at the time I also was like

1241
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,520
a picky eater so I want to say that like

1242
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,200
my parents were like eat it have some

1243

1258
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,640

and listen to all this stuff now and

1260
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,800

to memorize yeah that's that's true did

1262
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,240

kind of that Bri he's kind of that Gap

1273
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,319
mhm he's Bridging the Gap between like

1274
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,559
that kind of old school light-hearted

1275
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,359
you know piano comedy songs with like

1276
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,440
hard jokes like poisoning pigeons in the

1277
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:41,760

Dixie where we had a lot of slaves like

1282
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:51,319
it's very right uh my dad used to quote

1283
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,680
this one song that I forget what but

1284
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:56,200
it's just like everybody hates the Jews

1285
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,119
yes ah [ __ ] what is that that's uh it's

1286
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,359
like everyone something day uh oh crap I

1287
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,000
was just singing it just the other day

1288
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,000
but it's on the album we did when we did

1289
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,040
that album last time uh everybody's

1290
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,400
thinking about it's supposed to be you

1291
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,200
know appreciation like you know you're

1292
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,040
supposed to love everybody on that day

1293
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,319
yeah but everyone hates the Jews yeah I

1294
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,160
actually want So I listened to that one

1295
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:15,839
Tom lir album I want to get more of it

1296
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,520
um and uh and then of course I mean

1297
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,640
they're very recent but I I also think

1298
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,440
the Lonely Island are legit brilliant

1299
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:24,480
they're so good I know I have their you

1300
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,359
know their two albums and turtleneck and

1301
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:30,680
Shane is such a good I was just thinking

1302
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,559
of that song Today mhm it's it's crazy

1303
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,280
good that song is crazy good but I don't

1304
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,680
know how they're pulling off hip-hop to

1305
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,520
you know comedy hip-hop two years two

1306
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,799
albums in a row when everybody else is

1307
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,720
trying that and failing miserably who

1308
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,160
who's trying and failing miserably

1309
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,760
everybody on YouTube seems to be trying

1310
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,040
to do that they try that as a thing but

1311
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,720
I think at the end of the day Lon on are

1312
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,040
also just good sketch writers you know

1313
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,079
like exactly I see I think a lot of

1314
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,760
Comedy music is out there I mean my

1315
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:55,799
problem with like not my problem but I

1316
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,640
think a lot of people when they write

1317
00:49:55,799 --> 00:50:00,760
comedy songs or maybe like well the it's

1318
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,760
the fact that I'm singing it's fun so

1319
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,119
like I can say anything as long as I'm

1320
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:08,960
like singing and like it'll be funny

1321
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:11,960
yeah and also I think that uh Lazy

1322
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,480
Sunday you know was so big I I've seen a

1323
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,920
lot of Lazy Sunday knockoffs where it's

1324
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,480
and and that's a general Lonely Island

1325
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,119
ripoff but it's it's rapping about

1326
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,119
something in a badass way that isn't

1327
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,760
badass and I think that's really tired

1328
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,720
now and I think that's a lot of Comedy

1329
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:29,119
hip-hop now where it's just like uh you

1330
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,839
know go and do store and it's like yeah

1331
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,559
Lonely Island did that saw that yeah

1332
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:34,559
that's cute um then there's I mean but

1333
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:36,440
there are there are good ones there

1334
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,119
Dragon Boy suede is really funny and

1335
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,160
then um but yeah it's just it's it's

1336
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,880
seems hard to get right and I I don't

1337
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,240
know what people do to get musical

1338
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,359
comedy right I don't know what you did

1339
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,559
to get it right with that video I think

1340
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,240
having this sketch comedy background is

1341
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:54,359
a big part of it because now you're not

1342
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,359
just writing a funny song you're using

1343
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,040
elements of sketch comedy but just

1344
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:01,040
putting it to music and I think there's

1345
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,799
a there's a different approach yeah the

1346
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,839
way that I look at it and like you know

1347
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:08,119
again like I am I'm still kind of

1348
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:10,000
learning what it is but so far for me

1349
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,760
what it is is taking the rules of sketch

1350
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,680
and applying them to song and you know

1351
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,160
like when you're doing a genre parody

1352
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,720
sketch like you're doing a fil Noir

1353
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,119
sketch it's like that I mean especially

1354
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,640
with these

1355
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:23,559
song especially when you're doing genre

1356
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,920
specific songs which is often most times

1357
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:29,200
my way in is like deciding like okay

1358
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,960
well it's this or the genre and like it

1359
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,040
it's almost like not easier but it gives

1360
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:37,599
you rules that's what it is is like okay

1361
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:40,160
I'm writing um like I have a song like

1362
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,880
that I wrote that was like a n a jazz

1363
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,680
song from like the 1930s and I was like

1364
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,319
okay what do jazz songs in the 1930s do

1365
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,599
what are they about what's a Twist on it

1366
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:52,000
so it's like it's a set of rules to

1367
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,920
follow that are that feels very just

1368
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,119
like classic sketch comedy writing to me

1369
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:01,720
that makes sense um

1370
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:01,720
sorry [ __ ]

1371
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,119
sorry [ __ ] I had a question this

1372
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,400
happens every time this time in the

1373
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,480
podcast like my brain just freezes up

1374
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,640
because everybody else has been talking

1375
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,640

that's that's the other thing actually

1400
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,319
I'll use that one as an example um

1401
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,400
because it does bring up what I I had

1402
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,480
forgotten about it's got elements of

1403
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,040
it's kind of got a Kesha parody element

1404
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,319
to the mermaid one oh yeah 100% but it's

1405
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,119
not you're not just doing a Kesha joke a

1406
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,000
lot of people parody that one song of

1407
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,240
hers like just [ __ ] over and the

1408
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,400
first one was cute but after that I okay

1409
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,200
get it c a skank yeah the sing Talk one

1410
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,880
and that was more pointing out

1411
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,319
it's actually mocking the industry not

1412
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,640
really her as much specifically using

1413
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,640
her to

1414
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,280
Mo but then yeah I mean you're you're

1415
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,839
taking that you applied it to something

1416
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,520
about a [ __ ] mer killed yeah it and

1417
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:46,720
thank you I'm really glad that you liked

1418
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:50,599
it um and uh yeah that one's like a

1419
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,960
little more like kind of absurdy

1420
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:55,200
although that that one recently got me

1421
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,799
like hired for a job I would say about

1422
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,160
the other ones yeah oh really that's

1423
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:00,720
awesome I'm going to start writing for

1424
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,599
Robot Chicken in like a week and that is

1425
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,559
bitching excited I'm excited and in the

1426
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,559
and in the interview we were just

1427
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,440
talking about music videos because I

1428
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:09,359
plan on pitching some music video ideas

1429
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,480
and they mentioned that one specifically

1430
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:14,760
like stylistically and I was like oh

1431
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:17,119
cool that's awesome that you like the

1432
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,720
Absurd weird one that some people you

1433
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,319
know yeah well I thought kind of felt

1434
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,880
cartoon intentionally felt really so

1435
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:28,559
like I can see why they would love that

1436
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,960
so much um yeah I'm trying to think uh

1437
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,200
[ __ ] yeah but but back to parody songs

1438
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,760
you know I think and I think I've just

1439
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:39,839
never thought parody songs that are like

1440
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:43,440
um I'm Katie Perry and I'm a [ __ ] like

1441
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:46,000
it's like okay cool cool that what why

1442
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,920
what of that right right you know like

1443
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,640
it's it's just stuff that's like the

1444
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:54,359
artist being self-aware or just poking

1445
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,440
fun at the artist is I don't know

1446
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:58,160
there's no subtext to it whatsoever

1447
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,119
people don't understand that or when

1448
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,799
people do some people do parodies and

1449
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,040
they change like a couple lines and then

1450
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:07,079
like keep the chorus like the same and

1451
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,119
I'm like I don't be creative like what I

1452
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:10,799
think is great is in on weirdo's new

1453
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,480
album when he has his song You Know

1454
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:17,119
Party in the CIA that's [ __ ] he

1455
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,720
actually has he you know on the chorus

1456
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,559
Parts he actually sings different things

1457
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,280
whereas Miley sings the same thing every

1458
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,760
time so in essence he's more creative

1459
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,640
than her in his parody and it's probably

1460
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,640
one of the best s on the

1461
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,719
[Music]

1462
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:46,039
newb why won't you go out with me she

1463
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:50,839
lived across the street on the 15th

1464
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:56,799
floor of the galmore building I saw her

1465
00:55:50,839 --> 00:56:01,440
in the shower reaching for some soap

1466
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:05,400
I knew she had to be the girl for me and

1467
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:09,520
to think I probably never would have

1468
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:12,520
found her if I hadn't bought that

1469
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,520
telescope

1470
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:20,440
oh what can the problem be sweet

1471
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,119
man why w't you go out with me oh I'm

1472
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,000
excited and that's that's when weird

1473
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,119
all's best and that's what he does is

1474
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,039
he's not just a parody artist he he's

1475
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,280
not he's not parodying he he takes a

1476
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:37,359
song and the essence of the song the

1477
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,720
essence of the artist and then he makes

1478
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:43,079
a new idea which is like parody at its

1479
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,960
best yeah exactly yeah I mean and God

1480
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:46,680
and it you have to be a good musician to

1481
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,200
do it that's the other thing that people

1482
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,960
seem to forget you have to be a good

1483
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,799
musician the three guys in Lonely Island

1484
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,960
have to be good rappers I mean whatever

1485
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:54,039
you know they're really good yeah we're

1486
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,760
also probably the only one who's

1487
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:58,000
probably able to get away with actually

1488
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,160
referenc sing the band in it like you

1489
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,119
know smells like Nirvana mhm yeah I mean

1490
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:08,280
but but I think he's more mocking the

1491
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:09,280
grung like the the garage grunge thing

1492
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,400
that's how we got it approved though I

1493
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,960
mean he called them up when they were

1494
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,680
backstage at Saturday Night Live and

1495
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,200
said uh so I'd like to do this parody

1496
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,039
like okay is it is it about food oh yeah

1497
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,319
I was reading that and he's like no it's

1498
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:20,640
kind of about how people can't

1499
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:22,280
understand anything that you're saying

1500
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,039
they're like okay they they were cool

1501
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,359
yeah and later on they they you know

1502
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,039
they said you know that's how they knew

1503
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,520
they made it is that weird wanted to do

1504
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:31,559
a parody of them like that's how you

1505
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,880
know you know that you're famous you're

1506
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:36,280
a pop culture icon Weird Al s does a

1507
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,559
parody of you yeah K I think Kirk coang

1508
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,240
called him a genius was like weird

1509
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,480
probably right millionaire did

1510
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,799
Chamillionaire said he's amazing rapper

1511
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,079
well he does that [ __ ] in all one take

1512
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:47,520
too doesn't he yeah that entire song

1513
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,079
like he he if he doesn't do in one take

1514
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,520
he twist and does it again he is a crazy

1515
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,200
perfectionist also yeah his diction is

1516
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:58,680
impeccable yeah like he really is just

1517
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,000
has the words the most important thing

1518
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,079
which is so important it's time

1519
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,599
traveling diction it's time traveling

1520
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,599
hey I thought was the worst call back in

1521
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:09,119
theory you know there's a could have

1522
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:11,000
said it was a wall addiction which that

1523
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,680
would have been better that's really

1524
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,880
funny damn it there's a campaign to try

1525
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,880
to get Rial to be the next Super Bowl

1526
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,760
that would be performer for next year

1527
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,960
considering CU I don't watch the Super

1528
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,359
Bowl I don't think he would flip off the

1529
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,039
camera like Mia what what who did Mia

1530
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,839
off the camera was paying attention it

1531
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:33,839
happened for like a second it doesn't

1532
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:36,240
even whatever kids know what the bird is

1533
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,119
whatever showing a tit is one thing like

1534
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,119
I guess that's bad like whatever

1535
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,880
everyone's seen this like who cares that

1536
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,680
needs to stop being a thing who gives a

1537
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,400
[ __ ] I I don't she has to pays for it

1538
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,319
does she really really oh God she has

1539
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,839
enough money I'm sure she's yeah exactly

1540
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:55,000
it's like all bull craap it's like

1541
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:59,119
basically a curse on live TV fee is what

1542
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,720
it is yeah whatever ridiculous that is

1543
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,920
yeah Weird Al would be cuz then you'd

1544
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,079
have like picture if he did Fat you'd

1545
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,880
have like thousands of fat people or

1546
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:08,400
like people in fat suits coming forward

1547
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,640

00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,200
in 10 years it is a multimedia

1564
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,240
Extravaganza that's so cool but he does

1565
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,400
a quick change into the the fat suit in

1566

minutes they show like a short or

1569
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,960
whatever still like the suit [ __ ]

1570
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,240
inflates it's also great that he does

1571
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,319
that you know like some artists like

1572
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,280

Fat's from like 20 years ago man I I I

1574

spent $2,000 on the suit I better do

1577
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:14,680

1582
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:26,880

opportunity and then it could have been

1587
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:39,640
lips um and it could have been lips

1588
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,520
doing something aloca lips could have

1589
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,520
just been redundant to the point of

1590
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,559
complete

1591
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,559
nullification until the word has no

1592
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:49,280
meaning

1593
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:50,480
anymore um well I I uh I feel like we've

1594
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,880
taken up an hour of your time so that's

1595
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,559
usually when we stop there we lit like

1596
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,680
we like barely talked about the album we

1597
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,880
talked about dreams that's how it kind

1598
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,640
of goes

1599
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,680
um and if you if you'd like to do

1600
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,839
another one let us know because we'd

1601
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,280
love to have you on oh awesome it was

1602
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:05,200
really fun being here um plug away what

1603
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,839
what what should people look out for

1604
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,680
what are you going to be working on well

1605
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:11,359
I have two uh music videos coming out

1606
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,839
one should be coming out around

1607
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:16,000
Valentine's Day either tomorrow either

1608
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,200
February 13th or February like 15th or

1609
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,319
16th okay and that will be a slow Love

1610
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,559
Song and then I have one coming out in I

1611
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:25,039
think probably March that's basically

1612
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,039
ready I just want to space him out

1613
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:30,440
that'll be um like a new kind of dance

1614
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:32,039
music video and then along with that I'm

1615
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,720
probably be having a Kickstarter for an

1616
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:36,599
album I have five songs already recorded

1617
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,039
for an album but the kickstarter is more

1618
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:41,280
to raise money for the couple of songs

1619
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,839
for the album that need a live Orchestra

1620
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,880
like I have two kind of um one is like a

1621
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:51,000
Disney parody and one is a like an old

1622
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,319
school kind of jazz like uh jazz song

1623
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,440
and both of them need live instruments

1624
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,599
so I'm going to probably be and then so

1625
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,119
that's probably Kickstarter for like

1626
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,400
five ,000 so and then there will be like

1627
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:01,520
prizes you know well once you have the

1628
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,119
kick cider up let us pleas let us

1629
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,319
know oh that would be great yeah I I

1630
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:07,240
really want to do the album thing and

1631
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:08,599
then I I really want to like I don't

1632
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:12,319
know just keep a lookout you know I'd

1633
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:14,559
love to start performing live sure and

1634
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,680
uh keep out I guess keep look out that I

1635
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,839
don't I don't even know how to go about

1636
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,039
doing that yet what's your uh I mean I

1637
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:22,480
have a show at you I have a show at the

1638
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,880
UPR C theater in La that is uh it it's

1639
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,200
not going up in the next month or two

1640
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,799
cuz cuz La is a crazy timer now with

1641
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,039
pilot season but it's called Rachel

1642
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:33,000
Bloom as a triple threat and it's a a

1643
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:35,359
half hour show that I do I would say

1644
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,920
probably for that just another maybe

1645
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,480
Kickstarter just get enough money to pay

1646
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,240
for how much it cost to go with like a

1647
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,039
place like Largo that's a good idea cuz

1648
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,319
Largo is a small venue so it's probably

1649
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:49,559
not crazy expensive but it is very

1650
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:51,920
popular for like large like larger

1651
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,359
celebrities and a lot of people know you

1652
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,720
know whatever happens there is awesome

1653
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,160
yeah there are a lot of venues to do

1654
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,079
that that stuff and and I have a

1655
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,319
collaborator on the pop songs too where

1656
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:02,680
like we could get together I think it's

1657
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,480
just a matter of I think you know what

1658
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,720
it is is that I'd wanted do I'd want to

1659
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,680
put on an album so that at if I had a

1660
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,000
few like concert mini concerts I could

1661
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:14,440
then sell the album there so I think the

1662
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,640
album comes before live sh it would and

1663
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,359
it would be good to do that like right

1664
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,880
after the album because exactly you've

1665
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:21,359
got the you've got the momentum behind

1666
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,960
