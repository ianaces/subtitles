00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,519

G brage brage Braham G and we're

192
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,079
discussing his book tight corners and

193
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,600
what's around them what do you think uh

194
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,720
now when you say and what's around them

195
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,440
um uh most Corners uh is that some

196
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,640
indication of uh the the fear of uh

197
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,560
approaching the unknown uh of going

198
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,360
around a corner and not knowing exactly

199
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,880
what to expect no it's not a reference

200
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,839
to fear of what's around corners

201
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:42,399
particularly really uh it has to do with

202
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:47,000
the manipulations we go through yes in

203
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:51,480
uh in survival in our uh sexual survival

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,560
um in our survival for

205
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,720
sanity would you like to read some of

206
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,120
the book sure I have a few examples I

207
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,120
thought I'd share

208
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,320
now Mr brage will read from the book

209
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,800
whoops this is a piece I wrote uh

210
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:16,399
shortly after leaving the university and

211
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,440
I met my first wife

212
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,560
mhm oh so you've been married several

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,240
times I have had several wives really

214
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,800
how many

215
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,720
exactly well I'm now married to my third

216
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,800
wife third third what was the problem

217
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,360
with the no problem it was oh here let

218
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,760
me uh let me just just so you express it

219
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,920
in the I see mhm when I told you I

220
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,880
enjoyed it I felt disgusted with

221
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,320
myself truly it disgusted me yes as I

222
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,079
was afraid you'd see but I couldn't

223
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,079
bring myself to hurt you openly so I

224
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:54,000
told you it was great in such a way I

225
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,639
could be pretty sure you'd find out

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,160
later differently and I was

227
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:04,279
right so that is a uh a uh description

228
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,320
of a uh an intimate uh relationship that

229
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,720
you had with one of your wives this was

230
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,360
and that's uh your pry to a certain

231
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,279
cander that I don't usually yes reveal

232
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,360
about my work but and it was you were

233
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,160
disgusted by it

234
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:27,120
really I I felt disgusted with myself

235
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,360
not by it with with yourself doing it

236
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
like that no no you you don't understand

237
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
understand it

238
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,440
uh it's it's quite unique to our

239
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,959
relationship yes with with number

240
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,399
one with number one number one my my

241
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,279
first wife oh your first wife I see I

242
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:49,279
just I don't want to say her name on the

243
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,320
air and I thought number one is a a I

244
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,240
thought you speaking of a different

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,519
number one I'm I'm sorry Mr B um well uh

246
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,360
could you read U maybe possibly another

247
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:06,240
passage from the uh

248
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:08,440
the book I have one noted I you uh have

249
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,600
to misplace my

250
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,839
notes did you uh oh here I've I've uh

251
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:21,600
you find it we're uh kind of pressed for

252
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:24,360
time a second uh um you have uh

253
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,399
uh well this is another piece this was

254
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,560
uh later uh when when things were

255
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,959
becoming dismantled yes

256
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,880
this is about a different person by the

257
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,399
way this is not related to to the first

258
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,920
poem she was urging him to seize the day

259
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,839
to see his hour had come there would be

260
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,680
no second chance he would forever be a

261
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,279
weak Creature if he didn't stand on his

262
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,480
own two feet she leaned on him as she

263
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,839
spoke but then he was half supported by

264
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,959
her now her husband was tugging at her

265
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,680
sleeve saying just a minute the man

266
00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:00,000
startled asked who's

267
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,240
minute ja like a TS no thank you I'm

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,079
fine I notice uh uh lots of times uh the

269
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,160
subject of women uh pops up in your uh

270
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,920
writings is there any particular reason

271
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,680
for this Mr Bram well there's no

272
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,320
particular

273
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,920
reason you find them

274
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,399
disgusting there there have been women

275
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,959
uh that have entered into my sphere of

276
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,759
experience and I've reflected on those

277
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,399
experiences in my writing but uh there's

278
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:34,839
there's no particular pattern PN to uh

279
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:39,199
no pattern to uh so you you've uh you've

280
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:42,199
had some uh bad experiences in the

281
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,560
past no they they haven't been bad all

282
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:47,120
experiences are good there are no bad

283
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,120
experiences there's just bad

284
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,399
interpretations well well how can you

285
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,199
say that there's no bad experiences the

286
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,600
uh uh you just said in the book that you

287
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,880
were disgusted by a bad experience with

288
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,720
a

289
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,240
person feeling woman the feeling of

290
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,519
disgust I had was uh very useful it uh

291
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,360
it wasn't bad it was a a Vitality it was

292
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,199
bad but it it became useful because it

293
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,160
was

294
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,800
bad I think it it was useful initially

295
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,160
before its uh before its existence even

296
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,240
it was useful before its

297
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,320
existence yes it well what does that

298
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,639
mean all experience uh that that you and

299
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,839
I experience in life is uh is sort of

300
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,920
weighted for us to approach it's it's

301
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,759
waiting in in the future this our

302
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,800
meeting was

303
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:42,360
predestined do you know the um Library

304
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,560
of Congress number of this book by any

305
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,519
chance I I don't know the Library of

306
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,720
Congress number why do you ask what you

307
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,120
don't know the Library of Congress

308
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,160
number that has nothing to do with the

309
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,639
work that's just a reference well it's

310
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,160
has if you don't know it's it's got I

311
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,959
think quite a bit to do with the work

312
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,880
it's the library of Congress as we know

313
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:07,000
is a uh Storehouse of the vastest amount

314
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,560
of information um in the world and um

315
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,240
for you not to know exactly uh where you

316
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,519
can uh find what you have done

317
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,440
personally uh I I keep track of all the

318
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,000
numbers of uh what I have done in my my

319
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,120
writings my work you have writings that

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,279
are in the Library of Congress of course

321
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,560
yes your your your clinical studies

322
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,759
maybe you use a Dewey Decimal System but

323
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,519
that is kind of

324
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:39,160
outdated as many of us know with the new

325
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,199
uh computerized um Imaging systems and

326
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,639
pro data processing systems doctor I'm

327
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:47,440
not familiar with uh the filing system

328
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,560
that various libraries have used to

329
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,079
categorize my my writings that's that's

330
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,959
not what I'm here to

331
00:16:52,079 --> 00:17:00,600
discuss if we could get a uh closeup uh

332
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,199
once again of uh of the book I notice uh

333
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,959
there's a picture of you in the back

334
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:09,760
here with a little biography we can get

335
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:13,559
a closeup of this um we had a closeup of

336
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,240
the uh picture that you uh find here in

337
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,679
the back of the book that was taken just

338
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,079
after uh we had agreed on the

339
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,640
publication with uh with the Publishing

340
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,160
House mhm what's what's your question

341
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
about well I I noticed here that you

342
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,120
have a beard that's right I was why why

343
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,880
why Why Did You Have A Beard at that

344
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,080
point were you trying to hide something

345
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,919
I I had the the beard was just something

346
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,520
that that grew on me I didn't uh I

347
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,200
shaved I put on a suit to to be on this

348
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,679
program I I have beards at different

349
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,600
times it's of no significance to me

350
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,200
whether I well you're are you aware I

351
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,640
have no problem that you shave I don't

352
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,080
know maybe you shave every day maybe you

353
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,039
don't well I shave four times a day but

354
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,919
I you shave four times a day

355
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:07,320
a day I find it necessary myself to the

356
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,720
public people with beards I think uh we

357
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,120
all know what happened when everyone

358
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,200
started growing beards we immediately

359
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:20,080
had a fascination with uh recreational

360
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,400
vehicles and um CB radios and completely

361
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,000
destroyed the uh Integrity of this

362
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,360
country increased my interest in

363
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,720
recreational vehicles or CVS in which I

364
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,360
have none well not necessarily that but

365
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,159
also drugs uh most people who take drugs

366
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,120
wear beards I don't understand your your

367
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,960
uh relation between facial hair and

368
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,360
interest in CB radios okay I I think

369
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,840
that's not founded okay but uh but

370
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,440
that's not my concern anyway well let's

371
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,919
uh could I read some possibly of uh this

372
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,200
book um well if uh yeah if you'd like to

373
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,600
I guess

374
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,240
um find a

375
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,520
a good uh a good passage here um the

376
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:13,240
book works best as read cover to cover

377
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:16,720
the uh the various Pros are linked yes

378
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,679
mhm even though they're uh from various

379
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,080
how hard it is to speak of the death of

380
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,400
love if that is the death and the

381
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,799
emotion I do speak of here there's an

382
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,080
almost inter interminable search for for

383
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,799
the right word and what makes it so

384
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,559
difficult if not an equal determination

385
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,440
not to disclose oneself to what the

386
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,640
right word is I would be absolutely

387
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,080
clear at the onset on one point I'm a

388
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,000
man who doesn't always get what he wants

389
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,799
but possessed of such determination and

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,440
willpower that I believe had I wanted to

391
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,480
be president I would have come close

392
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,640
well that's an interesting passage that

393
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,559
you realize the potential which uh you

394
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,240
you you have in yourself that uh we all

395
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,600
have the potential to become presidents

396
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:08,600
and a Statesman and uh very powerful but

397
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,720
uh you you've uh kept to just writing uh

398
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,480
poetry I have uh that was not

399
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,760
particularly a reflection of my

400
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,280
aspirations see I had thought from the

401
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,760
the title of the book at first glance I

402
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:25,120
had thought the book was more about um

403
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,600
uh design uh interior design uh of uh

404
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,039
rooms and buildings like you might find

405
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,960
uh uh tight corner and what's around

406
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,960
them in the Next Room I I had not the uh

407
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,120
I I am a fan of poetry I I do write some

408
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,760
of my own as a matter of fact my

409
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,080
interest with with I I thought it it had

410
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,760
been technical of a technical

411
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:52,360
nature no it's not technical other than

412
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,200
the technical experience we have in life

413
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,960
and tight Corners certainly are uh a

414
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,039
thing that we encounter what kind of

415
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,559
corner corners do you see to be the

416
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,919
tightest Corners well

417
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,120
the the tightest

418
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,200
Corners would would have to

419
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,720
be the corners imposed by human

420
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,320
relationships

421
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,880
yes which are so tight in fact that uh

422
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,520
we may not be able to

423
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:26,240
maneuver uh through the door of our

424
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,120
apartment or uh or through the door of

425
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,960
this

426
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,640
studio well what maybe a tight cornered

427
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,720
relationship we're establishing which

428
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,919
will not let us leave this stage

429
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,679
potentially and uh that's something we

430
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,120
have to accept when it happens so you

431
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,440
find you find uh these tight Corners to

432
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,240
be something to

433
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:53,039
avoid or just be prepared uh that you

434
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,919
you may be in a tight corner and to be

435
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,120
at would you rather have a corner with

436
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,200
your tight corner be tighter or less

437
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,520
tight if you the tightness is is really

438
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,520
irrelevant it's the openness that you

439
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,159
experience irrelevant things with

440
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,000
exactly so you feel that the tightness

441
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,840
is irrelevant to the situation of being

442
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,279
in a tight corner it's one aspect of how

443
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,039
could you write a book called tight

444
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,440
corners and find the tightness is

445
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,799
irrelevant to uh relationships to it

446
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,799
could have been many titles tight

447
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,159
Corners life experiences tight Corners

448
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:27,240
is a useful title because it's something

449
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,799
that people identify with so people

450
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,440
identify with it because they understand

451
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:35,559
understand tightness and they want to be

452
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,919
uh uh tighter people and they're not um

453
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:42,760
interested in trying to avoid um the uh

454
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,000
uh the the tighter relationships I think

455
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,679
are the better ones if you say you're

456
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,640
tight with someone that is a good uh uh

457
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,559
thing to say that means working closely

458
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,320
with them and you're not when somebody's

459
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:58,080
tight with you that that has nothing to

460
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,679
do with being in a tight corner with

461
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,559
them it's just the opposite it's it's

462
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,640
not a tightness of a binding nature it's

463
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:09,400
a tightness that's open yes it certainly

464
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,120
is it's a a binding and and close-knit

465
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,600
uh relationship you don't you don't feel

466
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,559
that you experience openness in in your

467
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:21,120
close relations well you experience

468
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:23,760
openness in a tight binded um way uh you

469
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,720
don't um you you don't you're not open

470
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,120
with just anyone I can do anything with

471
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,440
my work I'm trying to expand people's

472
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,120
ideas and bring them to a more open

473
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,520
understanding of their experience well

474
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:39,799
it it it seems like the uh

475
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:43,039
uh it's uh I'm not sure I any impression

476
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,880
of that from the work read surprises me

477
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,919
I don't see why you don't uh well I

478
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,960
don't see why you you feel that you must

479
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,679
avoid these tight corners and you feel

480
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,520
that uh relationships that are tight are

481
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,200
uh unacceptable and uh not uh I'm not

482
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,919
involved in avoiding anything I've been

483
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,679
open to all experience guess you have

484
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,760
been avoiding my questions and you've

485
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,600
been kind of uh getting off the subject

486
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,480
at times and I'm just trying to find out

487
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,679
the uh what you exactly mean when you

488
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,720
say that relationships you're you're

489
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,520
pushing yourself into a tight corner and

490
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,520
why this is something that you want to

491
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,120
avoid especially if you've written a

492
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,679
book called tight corners and what's

493
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,559
around them I if I see a tight corner I

494
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,440
immediately want to see what's around it

495
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:28,840
I'm not uh afraid I want to uh prob

496
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,480
what's around the uh corner so you think

497
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:35,520
that you can prepare yourself for

498
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,000
experience and avoid pain and suffering

499
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,880
is that is that your idea that you're

500
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,360
going to be able to uh prepare yourself

501
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,360
in some way well I I think now you're

502
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,000
just you're getting philosophical

503
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,640
there's no need to get philosophical I'm

504
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,880
dealing with a a real issue I'm not

505
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,000
dealing with it is very real everyday

506
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,760
experience whether philosophic issue

507
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,320
like whether we're going to constrict

508
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,440
existentialism or something constrict

509
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,240
our experience we're we're we constantly

510
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,799
trying to constrict our experience

511
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,559
because that is that's what life is

512
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,720
about you don't go around life um uh

513
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,679
life is made up of constrictions and

514
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:16,600
constricting experiences your your body

515
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:19,000
is put into a a tight frame and and cell

516
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,320
each there are millions of cells in the

517
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,080
body and in each cell is a tight little

518
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,000
constrictive um framework and uh that's

519
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,760
how things work they don't work if if

520
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
things are just spilling out all over

521
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,279
the place um so I'm not sure exactly

522
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,440
what you're trying to get

523
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:43,919
at you you seem to be trying to do you

524
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:47,080
eat meat or are you a do I eat meat yes

525
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,159
I I eat no meat you don't eat meat I

526
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,799
didn't think so and that has very little

527
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,200
to do with our discussion you tipped me

528
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,000
off very early that you're if you could

529
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,799
get a closeup if his lapel uh is folded

530
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,399
over I I didn't mention it earlier um

531
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:04,120
because um I I wasn't sure if you wanted

532
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:07,000
it to be like that or not but this is a

533
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,000
television show and for things to be um

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,799
kind of slop slopp see I walk into a

535
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,520
situation without concern of uh total

536
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:20,000
preparedness I'm I'm prepared as I see

537
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,840
fit and

538
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,360
uh my uh my avoidance of red meat and

539
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,880
other red Foods you avoid red Foods I

540
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,240
avoid any red

541
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,559
Foods why is that well I feel the the

542
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,279
the red the red is a is a is an

543
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,159
influence that's going to be limiting to

544
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,919
me why is it limiting red it it has red

545
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,320
is a uh color it's an important color

546
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,880
out most other colors it's uh an

547
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,640
important color because it tells us that

548
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,840
there is danger approaching if you don't

549
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,120
like red how can you say tight corners

550
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,000
and what's around them it it it seems

551
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,120
like you're you're speaking of danger

552
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,880
and um red is uh a color that signifies

553
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,240
danger and and uh fear Poss it's it's

554
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,360
like a shut off exactly red is is like

555
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,360
the stop sign the shut off

556
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:17,799
yes go on

557
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,559
please and and the shut off is something

558
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm I'm uh cutting out cutting out the

559
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,320
red meat cutting out the shut off

560
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,919

561
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,919

open I'm open to what you're saying but

570
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,600
I feel that you've missed my point

571
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,760
you've been too open that's why you've

572
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,000
missed the point and I I think that we

ideas and Concepts I have a very open

584
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:32,519
mind when it comes to study and uh basic

585
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,240
uh uh nature of things and uh basic

586
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,399
research basic chemistry for example I'm

587
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,200
very open to that and you uh if you come

588
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,480

chemists um doctors biologists um uh

605
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,650
people in uh many fields of study who

606
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:51,080
don't get a chance to come out and

607
