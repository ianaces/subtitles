1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,600
I thought I knew what I was doing in my

2
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,600
life like how you define yourself is

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,320
very different than how other people

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Define you if somebody said hey what's

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,240

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,960
think Bruce Bruce is a [ __ ]

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,680
skull two different things how people

11
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:38,239
perceive you I thought I knew what I was

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,600
talking about this is what I thought man

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,960
I've been doing comedy a long time I

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,800
know who I am I know exactly what I'm

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
doing and I was walking down the street

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,640
in

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,800

the [ __ ] up eyes that's you

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,920

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,920
describe myself

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,360

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
quiet teammate they dared me to do it

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,880
but I was scared of them and then I was

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
dating the girl at the same time and she

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,520

could have done let me tell you what's a

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,960
very effective teaching tool for

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,720
relationships two TVs in the house try

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,840
that [ __ ] for a little

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,959
while two TVs in the house you ever

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,390
noticed how vastly different you [ __ ]

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,770
TV won

54
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,770
[Laughter]

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,440
is my wife likes to watch St that makes

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
her cry on purpose

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:39,200
I haven't had a good cry since Wednesday

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,200
so why don't we watch this cancer baby

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,040
documentary oh God this is so sad well

60
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,640
change the tanel watch a cartoon No

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,640
don't touch it I need to see

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,239
it oh man uh it took a long time in

63
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,879
terms of uh me feeling like I was going

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,080
to be ready for it because uh again I'm

65
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,200
I wanted that Marvin Gay like Marvin Gay

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,640
when he wouldn't did what's going on he

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,879
got in so much trouble from the record

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,239
label because he was over by months and

69
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,720
months he said I just know it's not rich

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
so he went and locked himself in the

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,440
Poconos and they wanted him to do the

72
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,440
same old Tammy Terrell pop music stuff

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,000
and so I thought if I'm going to do an

74
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,799
album you know I want to be something

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,640
special and so I went through the eye

76
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,519
surgeries that I did and I found that

77
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,360
piece of material which took me about 20

78
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,599
minutes of material and I thought okay

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,959
now this is what I'm going to wrap the

80
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,599
out album around so I called the blind

81
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,159
ambition and we turned into a special

82
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,360
and then standard records made of my

83
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,879
first album and then you know those guys

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,040
being as good as they are having

85
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,560
represented Lewis Black and everybody

86
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,959
who was good uh for it to do as well as

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,000
he did in terms of critical success was

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,079
like it was I get emotional thinking

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,680
about it man it was such a almost

90
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,799
biblical leap of faith to get it done oh

91
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,079
listen oh I got to tell you what

92
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,599
happened so one time I was was about to

93
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,519
have surgery on this the the only good

94
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,040
eye that I have and a New York surgeon

95
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,640
said we can try the procedure and it

96
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,239
might work but it probably won't I was

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,720
like might work but probably won't how

98
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,720
many years of medical school is

99
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,600
that everything might work but probably

100
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,600
won't me trying to fix it myself might

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,479
work but probably

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
won't who wouldn't do anything with

103
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,120
those kind of options you could try to

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
make a sudden move jaill pocket in front

105
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,450
of police and it might work but it

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,120
probably

107
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:38,199
[Laughter]

108
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,000
won't you can you can try to let Jesus

109
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,240
take the we feel like the song so much

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,880
that might work but it probably won't

111
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,479
you try to eat a bucket of Popeyes and

112
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,080
sit through a coffee date and it might

113
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,520
work but it probably won't you try to

114
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,160
get Jews of forgive and forget might

115
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,520
work but probably

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
won't you try to get a big black woman

117
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,160
celebrate quietly on the prices right

118
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,120
guess what's going to

119
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,039
happen what's next one what do you got

120
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,440
coming up next what I've been working on

121
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,039
is um I know at some point I'll have to

122
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,600
do another hour but I haven't really

123
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,639
been chasing that new hour yet uh I've

124
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,120
been really working on uh a television

125
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,080
show which you have in development

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,400
called Linux 2020 that I wrote uh on my

127
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,440
phone you know like holding the phone to

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,919
my eye like this is how I write no glad

129
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,960
like this and I wrote a whole script

130
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,080
like this because I got I you know I

131
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,160
knew that I have to change something

132
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,639
because I got so much success from blind

133
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,600
the mission I was going the road

134
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,840
constantly 250 260 days a year and I

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,479
thought well this is going to kill me

136
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,199
and I have to get to another level so I

137
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,240
wrote this this show based upon my life

138
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,639
and my experiences and my day-to- day

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
it's something that I've always dreamt

140
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,960
of doing but I'm finally in a place

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,400
where you know it's it's me it's what I

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
it's it's who I

143
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,800
am can I tell you a story this is

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,280
exactly what happen this is true story I

145
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,479
came and so after one show I'm in uh I

146
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,280
go to my hotel and then I want to uh I

147
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,720
order a little late night panini

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,720
sandwich and uh the dude knocks on the

149
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,080
door I don't have my glasses on but I

150
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,520
got $20 in my pocket as I open the door

151
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,039
20 bucks squirts out of my hand and then

152
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,080
and then he goes hey that's $3.50 I go

153
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,680
okay listen dude I apologize but my eyes

154
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,000
are bad uh I'm pretty sure there's a $20

155
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,240
bill on the floor in here somewhere you

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,520
want to just come in here and just bend

157
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,520
over and grab that 20 for me

158
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
and he just start

159
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:43,560
running I mean he took off like he had

160
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,560
fallen for that before you I mean

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,919
like so in his mind you know what he

162
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,680
thought he thought that I was some sort

163
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,039
of unauthorized love

164
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,479
maker and that was my go-to move like

165
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,800
that's how I get them is like checking

166
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,919
hotels and I tend to be blind and I call

167
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,120
random sound delivered man and just be

168
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,120
like oh [ __ ] is somebody in this room

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,319
because I can't see very well I don't

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,319

you the whole time this is all part of

175
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,240
my gimmick
