33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,400
interesting and uh useful uh software

34
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,200
package called mind

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,560
prober and uh we're going to demonstrate

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,560
uh the uh the software package tonight

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,519
on the show and we're going to do a

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,920
little demonstration of uh of me and

39
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,159
we'll see how the program works thank

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,400

Dr bunx um what uh how long have you

47
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,120
been working on uh software

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,640
packages well this is my first one

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,920
actually I used to just write this by

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,439
hand but I had a friend uh describe it

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,040
and show me how to use it and I've just

52
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,439
recently bought this computer uhhuh uh

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,400
yes this is a this is a very very uh

54
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:05,599
useful uh uh machine uh Macintosh you

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,000
someday I hope to know how to use it I I

56
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,879
see that's a funny joke um uh so so you

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,040
uh did you actually develop the software

58
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,840
you you developed the software for uh I

59
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,919
figured out what to write down and then

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
they wrote it down for me they put it on

61
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,720
the software and they showed me how to

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,919
well on the the floppy disc they they

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
what language Square thing what what

64
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,120
language were they using in uh

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,880
developing this no uh the the uh the

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,280
computer language what what uh what what

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,720
uh Co what code was

68
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,199
it um well the the one with English

69
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,160
words where no no what what computer

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,680
what programming language was it oh I

71
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,840
see uh basic maybe I I'm not sure what

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,520
what what language is they used basic

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm not sure I don't know that's the

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,479
only one that I ever used I remember in

75
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,560
second grade I was first introduced to

76
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,840
the computer and I I used basic at that

77
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,680
point I don't know what so you you you

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,680
uh you you program only in basic then

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm not really sure what I program in I

80
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,840
didn't really program this I just made

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,520
up the test oh so you you um you you

82
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,800
simply uh designed the uh the uh the

83
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,240
test itself you weren't involved with

84
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,840
the writing of the software uh no I

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,400
wasn't someone else figured that out for

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,720
me and has showned me how to use this so

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,440
I'm I'm learning a lot and it's a an

88
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,319
it's an exciting phase I thought that

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,120
you I thought that you had actually been

90
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:34,440
uh been uh the the initial software

91
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,960
developer for the uh and uh someone

92
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,479
someone had come to you with uh well I I

93
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,639
thought you that you had done the the

94
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,840
whole thing that you um uh had written

95
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:49,440
the the the software well as I explained

96
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,600
I I'm not I wrote it so you uh and and

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,440
you know just a little bit of

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,360
basic uh you that's what it is you you

99
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,280
don't even know what language they used

100
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,039
I'm not for sure no I'm not sure I

101
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,800
should I should have that explain that

102
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,039
to me and I'm sure that I will that's

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,479
something that I'd like to learn all

104
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,560
about uhhuh well that's good that you

105
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,280
that that you want to learn yeah that

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,639
that's uh that's that's anyway we were

107
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,360
going to take this test well um uh let's

108
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,560
uh what what uh what what school did you

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,280
go to um our our uh did you go to a a

110
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,400
technical institute well I went to the

111
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,599
open school in R open School California

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,759
mhm and is there actually a school

113
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,800
called the open school the open school

114
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,000
we could design our programs I was I was

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,080
into non-traditional education at that

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
point

117
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,360
open why would they name a school

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,160
open should we had the freedom to

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,479
develop our closed in and and structured

120
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,840
and not open well actually I rebelled

121
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,840
against that I really really found that

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,440
confining and and it instilled a lot of

123
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,520
spiritual uh trouble in me to be in a

124
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,080
really

125
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,960
confining situation that that encouraged

126
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,759
Conformity and well it the the the whole

127
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:09,039
reason for school is is to uh establish

128
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,080
a uh uh something to conform too I think

129
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,360
um that's I've never I've never met

130
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,800
anyone who who really felt that way well

131
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,759
it um you so you went to the open school

132
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,840
that was in high school yes high school

133
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,360
that age high school was open open and

134
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,919
then so what was elementary school was

135
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,560
Elementary School uh uh easygoing all

136
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,960
over the place it was Redlands Sky View

137
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,840
Sky View elementary mhm it was it in a a

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,879
big big open building were these both

139
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,319
big wide rambling uh you know regular

140
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:46,000
regular old uh built in the early 60s

141
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:48,039
kind SCH yeah um well I I I I wasn't

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,039
well yes let's we can go on with a test

143
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,360
now if uh if you'd like um you're

144
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,319
disturbed about something there's

145
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,199
something well um I I didn't I I had no

146
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,120
idea that you weren't actually the the

147
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,840
the software developer on this you're

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,240
disappointed and that you went to school

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,879
called the open I don't know um uh what

150
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
our viewers would think um uh you know

151
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
someone going to to a place called The

152
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,759
open school I'm sure a lot of your

153
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
viewers went to an open school as well

154
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,199
there's one right here oh there is

155
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,039
there's several all over the country

156
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,159
it's an idea that really took root when

157
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,800
the non-traditional ways of learning

158
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,440
were first being espoused in the' 60s

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,039
well okay now let's not get into that

160
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,319
let's let's take a look at uh uh the

161
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,519
program the program is not open and uh

162
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,159
we can control somewhat uh the the

163
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,320
program is structured yes it is yes it's

164
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,839
a simple agree disagree format and then

165
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,360
after answering several things will come

166
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,640
up with a character profile that's very

167
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,560
good yes um so we can sort of uh skip

168
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,160
the first uh portion of the show because

169
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,160
uh we weren't actually looking at the

170
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:58,640
program um okay there ding there it goes

171
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,079
um okay now let's uh uh load up uh load

172
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,399
up the program and and uh we'll begin

173
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:07,640
okay um let's just uh get that no that's

174
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,680
um that's you you put yeah um to

175
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,800
Macintosh yes the arrow whoops I believe

176
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,680
that you you you you put that on on the

177
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,720
on the table I don't I don't I don't

178
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,120
what are you doing I'm move see when I

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,120
roll this ball it moves the arrow well

180
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,040
no that's that's you're supposed to that

181
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,560
is supposed to be placed firmly on top

182
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,680
of the the the surface there and then

183
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,279
you move I know that's called a for me

184
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,160
to do it that way I can't get the

185
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,320
perspective to move it around it's very

186
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,959
difficult for me to do that well I I I'm

187
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,920
I I I haven't used this computer very

188
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,880
much either I am currently a beta test

189
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,839
site for a cray 3 but but I do know that

190
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,440
I do know what a mouse is and I do know

191
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,480
the right way to use a mouse is to put

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,959
it firmly on top of the table to the

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,959
computer it's much easier for me to use

194
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,760
it this way but I will I will put it it

195
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,680
down if it will make you feel more

196
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,560
comfortable well I'm just trying I'm

197
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
just trying to I'm not talking about

198
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,360
feeling I'm not I'm not trying to to

199
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,079
make myself more comfortable I'm just

200
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,560
trying to to inform you the right way to

201
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,680
do it well and as the right way to do it

202
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,880
to put it on way I'm aware of the right

203
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:18,000
way okay start the program go ahead

204
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,600
okay mind prober yes that's what we're

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,600
going to be doing that's that's

206
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,040
it it should uh should work well it's

207
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,440
your program I wouldn't be surprised if

208
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
it didn't

209
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:45,120

viewers don't quite understand what's

255
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,959

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,959
this program you haven't even looked at

265
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,720
it yourself well it's your own program

just roll the ball you have to use it

269
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,519

second initial second

275
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,480
initial gee this is so hard to do it

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,920
this way well it's hard to do it when

277
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,880
you don't know how to do it I can't

278
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,000

279
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,120
own well now you're supposed to click on

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,920

284
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,560
here's the D okay and here's the S this

285
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,000
is where the S goes you put them out oh

286
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,920
you you put well sometimes when we do

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,639
things really hastily and with a lot of

288
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,120
anger we tend to make it worse well

289
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,880
sometimes when we just sit back and let

290
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,519
things happen nothing happens at all and

291
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,839
we just we just don't we don't care

292
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,839
what's going on and and we make errors

293
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,560
we have to be uh constantly um

294
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,040
questioning and and uh probing and

295
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,079
that's why that's why I chose to have

296
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,199
you on the show because I thought you

297
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,959

I'm getting very angry my feelings are

362
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,319
really welling up right now and I would

363
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,440
like you to do it yourself well thank

364
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,120
you very

365
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,120
much but I still would like to have some

366
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,600
say I wouldn't say sympathetic or well

367
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,360
it's my test isn't it it's not your test

368
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,039
if you okay if you want this to be

369
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,919
inaccurate um although of course you

370
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,240
know maybe if you maybe you are right

371
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,199
maybe this is just a really high

372
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,160
pressured situation for you and well

373
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,439
this is a TV show and of course if you

374
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,319
are high press if you are you expect it

375
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,039
not to be high pressure well of course

376
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,520
not did you expect to just come on here

377
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,400
and just to to sit back and relax and

378
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,320
talk about the good old days at the open

379
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,679
school and and to bring on something

380
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,720
that you don't you didn't even know how

381
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,679
to use how could you come on with a a

382
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,440
piece of Machinery that you're claiming

383
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,760
not only claiming to to be the author of

384
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,880
but you don't know how to use it and I I

385
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,919
think that that's very um that's very

386
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,880
strange do you want me to answer these

387
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,120

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,039
versatile person you fit well in many

542
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,960
situations you're the kind of person

543
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,159
that a lot of people get along

544
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,559
with um

545
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,919
what what was the what was the criteria

546
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,520
for this for this um this program this

547
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,360
is based on the answers that you gave

548
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,240
yes but you you you somehow you you well

549
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
let's look at the next

550
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,919
one you're cooperative and a practical

551
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,240
friend you're Adept at the give and take

552
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,039
relationships considerate companion you

553
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,919
expect the same balanced approach from

554
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,120
those who want to be involved with you

555
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,799
you tend to be at ease interpersonally

556
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,039
being neither the overly dominant or

557
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,520
passive again these are based on the

558
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,559
answers you gave me well no this is

559
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,120
based on what you put into the computer

560
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,760
b i a no matter what you I have a

561
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,200
feeling that from what what I've seen of

562
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,840
you so far that it doesn't really matter

563
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,480
what you answer very carefully okay this

564
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,000
has been very carefully researched

565
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,200
everything is based on character

566
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,919
profiles people that I've spoken with

567
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,679
this is based on the answers you gave me

568
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,279
and maybe the answers you gave are

569
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:29,360
wrong when life throws um Dr sphincter a

570
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:32,440
curve he runs with it now is that some

571
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,640
kind of U I don't see why you need slang

572
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,760
why can't you be a little more

573
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,840
scientific in your description problems

574
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,880
in everyday living don't usually bother

575
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,120
him when all does not go well he can

576
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,679
usually stay calm well that's completely

577
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,600
wrong isn't it I mean you it's

578
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,799
completely wrong well this is how come

579
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,919
you've uh written a program like this

580
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:55,279
it's because it's based on the answers

581
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,159
you gave me maybe you should look at the

582
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,159
answers you gave well maybe you should

583
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,960
