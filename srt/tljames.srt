book which conerns itself with many um

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,039
different topics mhm um yes I think I

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,280
think that'd be a fair assessment when

31
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,800
when did you uh first uh get the idea

32
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,080
for the book oh two or three years ago I

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
think when I was shaving that's why it

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,160
begins with the shaving scene Lyn I'm

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,319
going to tell you more little details

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,640
you had an accident when you were

37
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,400
shaving yes I did yes and that that's

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,280
clearly outlined in the book in the book

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,680
The there's many uh many um accidents

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,599
and um home safety hazards which take

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,920
place in the home that have to do with

42
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,519

um which uh was called Falling Up The

259
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,240
Stairs we are with James

260
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,519
lyx where where what kind of name is

261
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,600
lick Li it's sort of Ukrainian sort of

262
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,800
Ukrainian partially Ukrainian H it's it

263
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,720
doesn't sound like it to me um sounds

264
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,360
like it's a madeup name like many

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,160
authors and actors people make their

266
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,639
names up to sound more that's right I

267
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,000
made it up and I chose one so easy to

268
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,279
pronounce so people like you could say

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,200
LX and stumble that's what it says it

270
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,600
says L say lilx it says lilx there's no

271
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,440
hyphen there's no hyphen that says Dr

272
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,880
sphincter here pause all right do you

273
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,760
see a hyphen on the cover of that I

274
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,199
didn't I'm not talking about hyphens I'm

275
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,320
simply talking about pronunciation

276
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:21,920
hyphen is the sort of thing you're doing

277
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,079
that vocalized

278
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,639
pause now an excerpt from falling up the

279
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:31,920
stairs I had one foot out of the tub and

280
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,000
was about to step onto the tile ooh this

281
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,480
is taking place in the bathroom yes it's

282
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,680
taking place in the bathroom when I

283
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,079
noticed I had already deposited a

284
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,880
substantial quality of quantity of water

285
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,519
on the floor but it's not dangerous and

286
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,519
the TV was on the floor plugged in war

287
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,920
still raging across its 6in screen I was

288
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,519
able to step onto the adjacent toilet

289
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,600
without touching the floor from there I

290
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,079
got the towel crouching on the bowl no

291
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,279
no it sounds it sounds like a gargoyle

292
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,440
coming to terrorize if you listen if you

293
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,800
read it on the page it sounds nicer it

294
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,360
really does it really does it no but if

295
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,600
the person reads it and kind of hears it

296
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,079
in their mind it really i' I'd

297
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,760
appreciate it are you you're one of

298
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,279
these are you one of these Zen people

299
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,680
that like to chant inside of your no but

300
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,160
sometimes when you I was simply reading

301
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm I'm trying to read an excerpt from

302
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,079
your book and I'm trying to sell books

303
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,920
and if you realiz that's why you're on

304
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,320
the show you're trying to sell this book

305
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
right but if you read it in as a tone as

306
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,680
pedantic as the silly questions you've

307
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
been asking me all this time no stupid

308
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,199
book you didn't read it you started out

309
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,360
the show by admitting you read no more

310
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,519
than the first couple of paragraphs no I

311
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,600
I said I read the whole thing you don't

312
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,480
even know what the ending was you think

313
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,839
it's a book about home safety for is

314
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,760
about you're talking the the the the

315
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,800
excerpt that I read which I randomly

316
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,639
turned to by accident I I did not

317
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,040
pre-plan this the whole thing is about

318
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,759
the TV was on the floor you're talking

319
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,959
about a TV in a bathroom with water on

320
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,440
the floor which is a potential Hazard it

321
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,560
is but does he fall no does he get elect

322
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,199
no absolutely he's avoiding an accident

323
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,079
I'm not the kind but I'm not the kind of

324
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,320
writer who has to tell people be careful

325
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,959
when you're in the bathro you are

326
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,880
telling people no I'm not it's not my

327
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,519
place to tell people paragraph

328
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,240
completely randomly open to is which was

329
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,560
completely by accident luck of the draw

330
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,560
try it again see if you find anything in

331
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,360
there about I don't have to try it again

332
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,199
I know what the book is about let me try

333
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,959
I'm surprised that you you don't even

334
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:25,000
seem to know what's in your own book I

335
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:28,079
know what's in my book I wrote you know

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,800
you must be like on drugs or something

337
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
maybe you're simply my mother used to

338
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,240
say you're on

339
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,079
drugs if we had time I could see some

340
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,079
identification to see if you actually

341
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,279
are who my used say that's what my

342
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,800
that's why when she would when I'd be

343
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,720
writing and she would say do we that's

344
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,839
when she wrote part of she um she only

345
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,839
wrote the title she only wrote the title

346
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,560
well you see we've already dragged out a

347
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,800
a horrible truth which has taken place

348
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,399
which you've you've you've lied and

349
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,480
you've you've said it's not about home

350
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,040
safety which it is you you've told us

351
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,000
that no one in your family had anything

352
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,480
to do with it which is another just the

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,480
just okay she all right chapters the

354
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,240
even chapters she wrote but that those

355
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,160
are the only one everyone el else is is

356
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,360
is is my all mind absolutely and I chose

357
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
most of the words and I edited what she

358
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
did and I also I gave her a thesaurus of

359
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,800
Christmas well I'm sorry that we we had

360
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,120
