1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,799
yeah hello and welcome to modern day

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,679
philosophers modern day philosophers

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,320
having failed to pay attention in school

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,680
Danny LEL now older and wiser will

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,920
attempt to learn basic philosophy 101

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,119
our young hero will be joined by today's

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,240
top comedians philosophers all their own

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,560
ladies and gentlemen here's Danny

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,560
LEL day philosophers

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,800
we are in the unoccupied during the day

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,680
Comedy Club the stand in New York that's

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,000
a conversation for another day as we had

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,520
off Mike about why the Sacred Space is

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,399
not used during CU I'll tell you that

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,719
the briefing is my theory is Club must

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,640
remain untainted by anything but comedy

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,640
until the night until it gets tainted by

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,000
comedy at night Alex picked for us today

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,359
a guy this is the first guy who's still

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,479
alive that we're studying on the show he

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:09,200
was born in 1938 which makes him about

22
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,000
75 I'm terrible with math but uh my dad

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,200
was born around then and I believe he's

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,640
around that age so his name is Tom rean

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,920
have you heard of Tom rean I have not me

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,960
neither and the reason Alex picked him

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,799
is because he said he knows about you

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,000
that you're very into animal rights mhm

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,520
and uh Tom wrote All About animal rights

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,720
so he thought this would be a good guy

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,280
for us to talk about okay I'm also very

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
into animal rights I didn't know that

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,119
about you well it's not like I I walk

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,280
around saying I am into animal I I just

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,960
believe that animals should be treated

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,000
with respect and dignity as as one would

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,680
hope humans are treated with respect and

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,719
unless of course the human or the animal

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,640
is undeserving of but animals are

40
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,600
innocent you know I mean like they uh

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,079
they even when they do things we

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,880
perceive as bad it's usually uh out of

43
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,479
provocation or a threat of some kind

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,520
it's not a a malicious thing that is

45
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,080
premeditated whereas there are some

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,160
humans who are sociopathic and or

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
cultural criminals who do not deserve a

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,120
lot of respect so you don't think that

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,400
um there are any animals sitting around

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,720
plotting well if there are I'm not aware

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,080
of them they they they're I'm not saying

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,080
there's not a thinking process there is

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,519
and some animals are unbelievably

54
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,720
intelligent and and thoughtful and

55
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,560
compassionate and all that I don't know

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,000
that they premeditate m

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,760
you know or uh you know collecting the

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,879
insurance money by disposing of a spouse

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,400
or a Don Draper like

60
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,000
reinvention after the Korean War things

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,040
of that nature cool well um well what

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,080
about what do you think constitutes an

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
evil person well I don't like the word

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,319
evil because it's reductive and it's the

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,800
type of thing that that uh you know when

66
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,440
George Bush among others evildoer it's

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,159
just like talking to a child and it and

68
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,879
uh it since the political discourse gets

69
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:05,879
lower and lower a lot of times that's

70
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,120
considered a legitimate question in a in

71
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,360
a debate what I think you mean is

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,159
somebody that that does things that they

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,440
could be uh incarcerated for or they

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,239
could be considered outside or you know

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,799
there are crimes committed Against

76
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:26,840
Humanity and against the environment and

77
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:30,560
against animals that um are are just

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,799
nefarious unkind unconscious selfish

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,799
things but I don't consider it evil in

80
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,280
the sense of that there is a there is a

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,760
just universe and a just deity somewhere

82
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,000
and then this satanic one elsewhere I

83
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,000
don't I don't believe in those things so

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,760
the distinction between animals being

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,239
innocent and humans not being innocent

86
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,519
well humans there are certainly many

87
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,239
innocent hum especially little ones and

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,400
babies and and things of that nature who

89
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,120
who have no malicious intent I'm talking

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:09,439
about a a thinking conscious adult Endor

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,239
te or cogn I mean adult enough child

92
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,319
that they understand consequences they

93
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,280
understand what it is to

94
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,160
harm and they do it anyway and their

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,919
life is not in threat and they're not

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,759
for any moral reason defending something

97
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,639
how much of it can you say could just be

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,960
attributed to mental illness or

99
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,919
upbringing well that's a whole different

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
thing okay so that if there is a mental

101
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,800
illness involved that is a different

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,919
thing that that again is not something

103
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,680
that isn't is particular nefarious or a

104
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,720
person who's thinking about how to harm

105
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,919
if there is uh neurological or brain

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
chemistry issues that's a whole another

107
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,960
factor that we should we should be

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,639
sympathetic to and take into account

109
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,080
whenever there's a crime committed or

110
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,800
something like that what about if

111
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
somebody was a victim of abuse

112
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,919
themselves to the point where that's

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,479
another thing I I understand is sympath

114
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,639
uh sympathize with I don't say I

115
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,360
understand it because I've been abused

116
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,199
what I'm saying is is a a person and an

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,639
animal are made like a pitbulls get a

118
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,479
bad rap I I am a huge fan of pitbull

119
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,960
dogs they are I have one as do I and and

120
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,600
over the years I've had a number of of

121
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,639
pites and fostered pit bues they are

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,199
they used to be called the family

123
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,440
companion for very good reason they

124
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,720
they're a wonderful dog they

125
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,840
unfortunately have been used by many

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,600
people for uh nefarious I keep saying

127
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,080
nefarious I'm trying not to say evil but

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,080
uh the if you punish and

129
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,400
abuse a dog any dog you know the most uh

130
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,319
aggressive dog is the jack russell

131
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,680
terrier but because it's so small and

132
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:48,360
cute uh people you know that pit are

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,280
actually uh rarely involved in in

134
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,919
attacks in the aggregate in a year it's

135
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,880
just we only hear about pitbull attacks

136
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,520
because it's news and also probably

137
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,280
somebody gets attacked by a Jack Russell

138
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,479
ter it's not as bad but it it's

139
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,720
certainly bad to be

140
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,360
you know if a child's attacked by sure a

141
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,440
Jack Russell teror it's still going to

142
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,319
be bad but uh pimples have a biological

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,759
imperative that makes their jaw lock

144
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,400
whether they want it to or not that's

145
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,080
another problem when they get involved

146
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,240
in a fight or if they're made to fight

147
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,960
they lock on and they can't disengage

148
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,599
their jaw very easily unless you pull on

149
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,199
their back legs or unfortunately stick a

150
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,680
finger up their rectum oh yeah which I

151
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,960
know it it it shocks them into their jaw

152
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,400
unlocking but it's very hard during a

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,919
fight or a dog you know someone had to

154
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,759
figure that out yeah to to do that and

155
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,160
also people think you're insane when

156
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:44,199
you're when you're trying to do it but

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,440
um it the the pitbull or any dog that

158
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,360
becomes aggressive and nasty has been

159
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,520
very mistreated because dogs are pure

160
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,400
heart they really are coming from

161
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,680
unconditional love they want to please

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,879
person so you really have to work at UH

163
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,639
making a dog but do you a bad dog you

164
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,039
don't think that's the same for humans

165
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,800
yes yes it's just that we were on the

166
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,960
Pitbull right uh to what extent can you

167
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,720
really say okay this guy is at fault

168
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,759
more than just he's a victim of his

169
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,879
upbringing or mental health or mental

170
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,919
illness whatever it is MH um well there

171
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,240
if if there is mental illness and abuse

172
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,560
that all has to be taken into account

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
and that's why I don't like reductive

174
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,199
words like evil and then there but then

175
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,400
there's a point where if this person

176
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,720
does seem to recognize even with the

177
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,120
abuse I'm not talking about the mental

178
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,800
illness cuz that really affects your

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,319
brain chemistry and your and and the

180
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,520
ways that you think and see things I'm

181
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,800
talking about a person that does not

182
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,759
have a a mental illness caveat we can

183
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,159
put into this but as a person who has

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,599
been abused and damaged that is all

185
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,840
something that should be people should

186
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,440
be compassionate about but there could

187
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,400
be a point where they see see this is

188
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,919
terrible you know I I I hated how I was

189
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,440
abused and treated but I'm going to do

190
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:03,440
it anyway not seek therapy not seek ways

191
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,520
around it um I'm not saying in every

192
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,560
case I'm just saying if if if there's a

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,960
way that's you have to have a certain

194
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,560
degree of mental health to do that right

195
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,039
even to just get yourself to the point

196
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,080
where you're like I could you know I

197
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,560
should seek therapy or just even to lack

198
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,319
so much empathy you know for for a

199
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,840
victim well that's another thing again

200
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,759
lack of EMP victim yourself yeah yeah

201
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,759
well there's things that that I can't

202
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,840
understand cuz I haven't been right

203
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,400
systematically abused so it's difficult

204
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,959
to speak with any eloquence on these

205
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,080
things when I have I have no firsthand

206
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:40,120
knowledge with no backhand with or or or

207
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,479
backhand oh that's terrible you made a

208
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,880
joke about abuse get the blogs going get

209
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,519
the letters coming for this guy but that

210
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,040
I I feel so I canot even pretend to

211
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,320
understand the depths of despair of of

212
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,279
somebody who since childhood has

213
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,640
suffered like that um and then again I

214
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,200
think there's a difference between

215
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,640
neurological uh brain chemical mental

216
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,279
illness and the Fallout from abuse there

217
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,680
may be two separate categories I'm not

218
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,920
sure MH uh does that make sense yeah um

219
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,200
and then there's people who have not

220
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,040
been either abused or don't suffer from

221
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
mental illness as far as we know who

222
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,200
lack empathy AB attribute that to who

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,880
knows personality type it's just it's

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,480
just hardwiring so there's some people

225
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,040
that just uh and they tend to to be in

226
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,040
powerful positions and they're Risk

227
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,720
Takers and they are impervious to others

228
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,320
emotions and that's how they become CEOs

229
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,200
or political Titans or do you know what

230
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,480
I mean like real Achievers in certain

231
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,480
Fields because they do not seem to be

232
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,079
bothered by the consequences of their

233
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,800
actions okay so um did that answer

234
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,560
anything that you asked me I don't even

235
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,040
remember what maybe it was interesting

236
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,920
either way I think yeah it answered

237
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,440
something especially that last bit that

238
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,640
you just said would you know that's a

239
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,640
certain type of person that you're

240
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,640
talking about that maybe is um just has

241
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,240
a mellian type of you know approach to

242
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,680
life and just trying to take over as

243
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,880
much as they can and in that case maybe

244
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,640
maybe that person wouldn't be I guess

245
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,000
the word in isn't evil we decided but

246
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,880
maybe that's the again I don't well look

247
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,959
at just say Wall Street for example just

248
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,399
the financial misdeeds of of the of a

249
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,440
hedge fun fund human who has no or the

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,040
Enron guys who work there and there was

251
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,800
the tapes of their phone calls when they

252
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,720
were laughing about artificially

253
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,240
destroying the electricity uh the flow

254
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,800
of electricity in in certain markets

255
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:52,040
and they uh there's something about that

256
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,120
culture right of of corporate culture

257
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,760
with that's deregulated and it and it

258
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,279
attracts a certain type of person as

259
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,240
does sometimes law enforcement politics

260
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,240
entertainment MH there are certain

261
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,959
personality types that

262
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,959
gravitate towards those fields for good

263
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,360
reasons and for bad reasons do you think

264
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,120
people have a moral uh do you think

265
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,079
there's such a thing as morality or a

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,160
moral

267
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,880
code uh I I would I guess there's

268
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,360
whatever society says it is and then

269
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,240
you're indoctrinated into that um it

270
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,200
seems to be fairly basic among almost

271
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,560
all

272
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,399
societies at least in modern you know or

273
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,720
but whatever you consider modern times

274
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,519
about killing would be bad although we

275
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,680
have

276
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,440
state well yes and no well everybody has

277
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,760
their interpretation of the origin myths

278
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,079
everybody has their interpretation of

279
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,600
deities and everybody has their

280
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,000
interpretation of what is a legal and

281
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,399
just way to run your Society so it it

282
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,399
just depends on where you were born and

283
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,279
in what era so do you think it's good

284
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
that Society dictates

285
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,639
morality well I don't know that Society

286
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,920
does dictate morality per se or I

287
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,320
thought you were saying basically it's

288
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,920
whatever society says is moral oh oh

289
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,760
what I'm saying is is that's what you

290
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,959
accept and that's what you grow up with

291
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,920
and I think I very confusingly was

292
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,720
trying to say that there seems to be

293
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,399
basic impulses of what is right and

294
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:21,639
wrong that I think predate are created

295
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:24,880
myths of of Good and Evil and uh you

296
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,040
know I even prates uh Egyptian and

297
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,279
Abyssinian myths which a lot of our

298
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,760
origin myths are based upon as concerns

299
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,760
religion uh I think that even in going

300
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,800
back to hunter gatherer times or or uh

301
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,920
you know

302
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,839
neander time whatever you know

303
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,079
Paleolithic I don't know I'm not very

304
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,279
smart but I don't know I don't know

305
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,199
exactly which I I think the hominids

306
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,279
were the

307
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:54,600
link between prehistoric and what was

308
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,519
considered modern I'm not about that

309
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,519
than you your smart friend would know

310
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,600
that's your smart friend but I think

311
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:05,959
even back then there was a sense of that

312
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,920
harming if you weren't if it wasn't for

313
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,399
self-preservation or or what have you

314
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,120
was wrong I'm I'm not positive about

315
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,079
that but it seems like people thrived in

316
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,959
communities of some sort and get and

317
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,600
traveled together and raise their young

318
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,519
and do you think it's based on just

319
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,880
human instinct like animal Instinct in

320
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
that way or is there anything innate in

321
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,160
us

322
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,920
that you know dictates well I would say

323
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,320
that when most children are born and

324
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,199
most most animals are born for the most

325
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,399
part unless there's neurological damage

326
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:40,480
in both the animal and human they seem

327
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,720
very very innocent and and uh have no

328
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
interest in in harming they they can be

329
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,639
quite selfish because they're little and

330
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,680
they're babies and they don't you know

331
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,040
they they're not thinking in terms of

332
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,399
what's good for the group or I shouldn't

333
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,240
make so much noise because people are

334
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,279
talking but I don't think there's a

335
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,360
sense of no devil babies well well again

336
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,360
you have to believe in in a devil well

337
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,480
no I was just using the term devil sure

338
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,079
that there is but it wouldn't be because

339
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,839
they are

340
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:09,639
cognitively diabolical it would be that

341
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,240
perhaps they're wired in a way that that

342
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,519
affects them negatively in their

343
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,800
behaviors what if the majority of people

344
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,199
started to be born wired that way well

345
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,639
that would be a problem for society

346
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,800
wouldn't it or or it would just change

347
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,480
what we consider more look at what we

348
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,639
can what we accept I mean it's it's un

349
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,120
it's unbelievable and shocking what

350
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:35,279
societies do accept whether it be State

351
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:39,560
sanctioned killing or illegal Wars or uh

352
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:42,399
rigged Financial systems uh the racism

353
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,880
the the uh misogyny all these things are

354
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,480
tolerated on a daily basis in quote

355
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,560
unquote democracies and so uh we do

356
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,040
tolerate quite a lot that that seems on

357
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,000
the face of it unacceptable yeah all the

358
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,120
while bragging about how we're the best

359
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,079
and the more and whenever on the news

360
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,519
when they say we're in danger of losing

361
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,040
our standing in the world we're in

362
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,639
danger of losing our moral High Ground

363
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,519
when do you think that our

364
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,240
self-described moral High our self

365
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,920
described moral High Ground now even if

366
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,079
it wasn't destroyed by

367
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,600
Vietnam uh which Vietnam certainly

368
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,000
helped destroy quote unquote our beacon

369
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,920
on the hill Divine Providence idea of

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,959
ourselves there was many other

371
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,319
atrocities committed before that that

372
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:31,800
that certainly did and since Vietnam

373
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:33,680
that the rest of the world doesn't share

374
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,199
you know our political platitudes I've

375
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,519
often wondered if if America were to

376
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,720
take on an

377
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,440
attitude not only that we weren't the

378
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,240
best because because that bothers me a

379
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,560
lot that whole the best country thing

380
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,079
because especially lot of countries do

381
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,560
it traveling yeah I was going to say

382
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,600
traveling around the world everybody's

383
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,959
got this best country thing and it's so

384
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,319
funny that some more than others

385
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,800
everybody thinks they have the best

386
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,079
country you know right well isn't that

387
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,959
again another Community thing uh that

388
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,880
you sort of do for for your so that's

389
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,920
what I was going to say like do we need

390
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,399
that I don't think we do and I think

391
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,880
it's actually quite dangerous you know

392
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,279
whether it's Rome the British Empire uh

393
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,480
Japan what if there's just one country

394
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,600
that held their head down low and

395
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,040
they're like we uh well there are some

396
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,040
countries that keep out of it you know

397
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,440
they keep you know the worst country no

398
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,880
no nobody would say the worst and like I

399
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,319
said America's not the only offender in

400
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,839
this area many countries declare

401
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,959
themselves the best because for whatever

402
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,079
reason they they calculate that the

403
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,600
masses are not mature enough to handle

404
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,120
they need the moral Bo boost the Boost

405
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,920
of or they probably don't need it it's

406
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,040
just well they think they need it anyway

407
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,440
or we're who knows though cuz it's not

408
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,759
been tested you know what I mean because

409
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,360
people seem to respond really well when

410
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,839
other social critics point it whether it

411
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,160
be George car the late George Carlin or

412
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,440
uh Bill Mah or or any other mainstream

413
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,839
you know social critics who say things

414
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,199
similar to what we're talking about it

415
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,560
seems very eagerly accepted and enjoyed

416
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:02,880
by a lot of people it's a it's

417
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,120
mainstream politics and mainstream

418
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,000
entertainment that doesn't indulge more

419
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,839
nuanced thinking since you brought up

420
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,120
George Carlin I'm going to bring up and

421
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,640
I've brought this up on the show once

422
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,799
before but I think about it a lot when

423
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,000
he talked about people own this country

424
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,679
we have owners M and I think if people

425
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,319
own the country that makes the citizens

426
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,039
a product that's own vassels vassels

427
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,959
well there's I think what he may mean by

428
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,160
that and certainly the ownership changes

429
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,640
over time in in many ways we are owned

430
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,600
by among other other people's CH China

431
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,880
you know they support us and we owe them

432
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,039
a great deal of money

433
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,480
and if they were to ever call in their

434
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,960
chips if you will right there there it

435
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
would be impossible to pay them back at

436
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,840
the interest rate and things like that

437
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,160
but that's you know we're not the only

438
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,280
country like that there's many countries

439
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,000
and then there's the international

440
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,000
monetary fund which rigs it so the

441
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,559
countries are constantly indebted to the

442
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
IMF and that's just human nothing's

443
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,919
going to change until human nature

444
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,360
changes this is fundamentally like all

445
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,159
political systems about the people that

446
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,919
that are the key players in those

447
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,679
systems and human nature is what it is

448
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,320
until it evolves somewhat so where does

449
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,520
power to the people come

450
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,320
in you know just isn't power to the

451
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,080
people overtaking the people that own us

452
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,919
well there is uh certainly a great uh

453
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,120
deal of organ you know organizations at

454
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,480
the Civic level is that what you're

455
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,720
talking about like people who get

456
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
together to do things and they make

457
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,679
changes that's also historically true in

458
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,960
in a lot of eras in a lot of countries

459
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,200
but do you don't think that there are

460
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,640
people who

461
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,600
actually um view the citizens of America

462
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,559
as a product that they own well there in

463
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,400
their interest to keep us thinking

464
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,679
there's no reason to ever leave America

465
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
this is the greatest country in the

466
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,919
world oh I don't know if that's the

467
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,000
thought process but I think that there's

468
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:03,159
definitely people who see it as their

469
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,400
right to own and to make the rules again

470
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,320
that's politics a lot of politics and

471
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,200
that has been true since there was the

472
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,520
ability to set up systems where powerful

473
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,840
people dominate that's that's human

474
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,320
nature that's what I'm talking about

475
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,880
this is this we could go back to the

476
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,440
Scottish Highlands if you want to when

477
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,320
there was Clans sure uh and then there

478
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
was a more powerful Clan than others and

479
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,000
then there were people that proclaimed

480
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,000
themselves Kings of those particular

481
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,960
regions and then there was the but you

482
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,520
don't think that there's some kind of an

483
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,679
effort that's made to keep the people

484
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,400
from Ever wanting to go anywhere else

485
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,520
just keep the people here I don't think

486
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,080
you have to make an effort there's

487
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,080
plenty of people who have no interest in

488
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,760
having a passport or going anywhere else

489
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
yeah but don't you think that they're

490
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,799
they are basically a product of a system

491
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,440
that's made them that way I don't know

492
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,320
if it's a system they're a product of uh

493
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,760
and you know there's plenty of people

494
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,880
that have ever have had every advantage

495
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,400
and privilege who have no interests um

496
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
and again they're just you know for

497
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,880
whatever reason they just uh don't have

498
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,039
a lot of interest but more and more and

499
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
more as time goes on people do have an

500
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,080
interest and they also get the ability

501
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,559
to connect globally through the new

502
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,679
mediums of Technology uh it's quite

503
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,240
common now for young people to be very

504
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,679
globally plugged in from their bedroom

505
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
you know what I mean and and friends

506
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,000
with people around the world and all

507
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,440
that uh so those things are changing now

508
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,520
there's certainly no doubt that there

509
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,120
are some

510
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,159
people that are we're number one I'll

511
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,679
kick your ass

512
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,640
blah blah blah where does that culture

513
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,840
come from it's trickling down from the

514
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,400
top well there there's always been

515
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,440
people at the top that have an interest

516
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,280
in fostering keeping the worker and

517
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,039
here of course that's again the nature

518
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,600
of power how does power Thrive unless it

519
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,960
yeah consolidates its power um but I

520
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,159
don't know that it's about having an

521
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,720
interest in

522
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,600
keeping these people in this country

523
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,120
there's always more people to dominate

524
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,240
who will come in there's always you know

525
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,320
what I mean it's I don't think it's it's

526
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,799
it bothers someone if they if they are

527
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,679
going to be an expat or if they're going

528
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,159
to travel what I think is in the

529
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,039
interest of some powerful people is uh

530
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,080
like Rupert Murdoch for buying up papers

531
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,080
and news stations dumbing it down

532
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,279
cooning and dumbing down Society that's

533
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,520
very useful to powerful people what does

534
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,600
Tom ran say about this I was just

535
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,039
wondering strictly about animals I was

536
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,720
wondering how to transition back into

537
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,279
that well I would assume animals don't

538
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,799
have don't have these systems although

539
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,240
there is a certain um it's not the

540
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,440
bonobo monkey which I believe is is

541
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,799
peaceful some strains of chimpanzee

542
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,000
which I believe that in the animal

543
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,880
kingdom we share like 96% of our DNA

544
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,720
with which is generous which is and also

545
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,799
I believe with pumpkins too we have a

546
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,880
great deal in common genetically with

547
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,720
pumpkins interestingly um with our DNA I

548
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,360
read that once it could be false but it

549
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,679
always stuck with me somebody Google

550
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,760
that

551
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,279
but any whoel um there is certain

552
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,520
aggressive

553
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:10,240
domineering groups of animals that

554
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,480
dominate the other animals by

555
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,360
force but there are

556
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,559
also other animals where the animal in

557
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,320
their animal communities they do the

558
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,760
exact opposite and it's about communally

559
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,120
raising children and it's about uh

560
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,400
caring for the elderly you know that

561
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,039
that's that's just and unfortunately the

562
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,520
animals that are indoctrinate ated into

563
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,279
the into the dominionist breed of animal

564
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,440
they pick it up as kids even into like

565
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,919
where there's a in some animals uh

566
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,880
communities they

567
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:46,120
kill baby boy animals male animals the

568
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,640
dominant males because of a

569
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,600
threat and then uh what kind of animals

570
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,360
do you Dolphins sometimes do it oddly

571
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,640
and certain chimpanzees do it and then I

572
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,480
was watching on animal King like certain

573
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,240
Lions sometimes do it if they want to be

574
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,000
the alpha male I went right to lions in

575
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,720
my when you I think that sometimes yeah

576
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,120
especially if they see a mate they like

577
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,120
and there's another get rid of the you

578
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,240
get rid of the competition or the

579
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,880
competition's child um it's it's tragic

580
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,799
and when you watch National Geographic

581
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,480
challeng stuff it's just as painful to

582
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,840
look at that that as it is to human

583
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,320
Carnage and tragedy you know I'm

584
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,600
thinking I'd love to think that I got

585
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,360
this information from National

586
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,880
Geographic but it's far more likely it

587
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,520
came from The Lion King you know See

588
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,200
Lion King but you know what many truths

589
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
are revealed in The Lion King that's why

590
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
it's so popular although I haven't seen

591
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,960
it I assume that or life of pie life of

592
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,360
pie didn't see it with the sound on I

593
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,200
saw it with the sound down and cried

594
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,600
like a baby at life of pie cuz those CGI

595
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,000
animals look so real to me and when they

596
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,559
were suffering I I was on a plane and I

597
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,360
was crying and there was a b a

598
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,559
businessman and I say businessman

599
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,679
because of how he was talking on his

600
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,120
cell phone when he was supposed to turn

601
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,080
it off he was using business speak like

602
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,320
at the end of the day you know

603
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,720
branding so he was in business but he

604
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,480
was watching life of pie with the sound

605
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,960
on and he had ner and emotion and he

606
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,120
kept looking at me like I was insane but

607
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,679
it it's like that's i p the silent movie

608
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,440
Life of Pi which I I'm sure is brilliant

609
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,559
more brilliant even with the sound on oh

610
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
you got to check it out with the sound

611
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,760
it's so beautiful and onle is a is a

612
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,880
great director but did you see Life of

613
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,440
pie so like the understand watching it

614
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,360
you know it's so visually stunning that

615
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,799
you know but did you feel oh no leave

616
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,600
the zebra alone like the little on the

617
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:33,960
boat and when he wouldn't let the tiger

618
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,240
back in the boat when the tiger was I

619
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,760
kept rooting for the different animals

620
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,440
to make it well at least that one you

621
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,399
know the tiger made it but he he was he

622
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
made the tiger seasick at one point

623
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:44,919
which made me feel sad or when he had

624
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,000
when he learned that lesson life lesson

625
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,279
with the with the goat being slain by

626
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,279
the tiger when his uncle or whatever

627
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,600
tied M the Little Goat to the yeah the

628
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,320
bars that and the orangutang the

629
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,880
orangutang is what I was rooting for the

630
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,679
most like just let the orang Tang I know

631
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,440
that's how I feel and and cuz it looks

632
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,600
so real and also cuz you know these

633
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
things happen in life and it wasn't a

634
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,320
real orang Tang no no no I believe

635
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,640
they're all CGI I mean they may use okay

636
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,679
they were filming them individually and

637
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,600
then putting them all together but I'm

638
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,760
might imag that the that that some of it

639
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,679
was they couldn't have done some of that

640
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,039
I so real yeah I because there were

641
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,880
certain scenes there's no way you could

642
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,360
get those takes the tiger I would I

643
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,080
would think would be I thought it was

644
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,720
all CGI but certain things happen

645
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,240
there's no way that could have been a

646
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,600
live tiger if you cried that much

647
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,720
thinking they were CGI I almost don't

648
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,399
want to tell you if they were well then

649
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,240
I don't want to know if they were real I

650
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,760
mean I can understand using real animals

651
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
for certain shots but you couldn't have

652
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,399
used them I wanted to protect you from

653
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,039
this information also the way that

654
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:46,960
animals would look at at him it C

655
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,960
there's no way you're going to get the

656
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,760
camera ankle for some of these animals I

657
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,200
would assume I don't know but then again

658
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:57,240
I am no expert in CGI in the life of pie

659
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,880
the making of yeah but um yeah I don't

660
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
want to know that they were really but

661
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,360
then then again the real ones wouldn't

662
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,600
have been eaten by them right right the

663
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,000
little Tasmanian Devil yeah Jackal

664
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,399
wasn't it hyena hyena whatever I think

665
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,520
of it I think of it like the um

666
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:16,159
Tasmanian devil in the cartoons yeah

667
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,080
just the way storm around and again he

668
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,440
was just trying to survive too and then

669
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,120
somebody told me after the fact that

670
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,799
those were metaphorical those were

671
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,279
humans yeah well it's I don't want to

672
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,200
ruin the movie but it's oh that's okay I

673
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,520
will never look at it again because it

674
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,399
was oh so you're never going to

675
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,159
no it was to up it's left at the end

676
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:35,440
maybe it is a metaphor maybe it isn't

677
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,399
you know okay cuz I I could tell also it

678
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
seemed he lost his family in the storm

679
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:42,919
is that accurate yeah okay they drowned

680
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,559
they drowned all right but they so there

681
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,200
wasn't I should animals representing

682
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,640
just to just as a favor do you want

683
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,640
maybe I'll I'll edit the movie for you

684
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,200
and take out all I can't honestly it was

685
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,159
so painful really um such a good movie

686
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,840
though oh it's beautiful it it was

687
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:02,200
beautiful but then uh just from

688
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,799
the scenes it's so emotionally brilliant

689
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,399
that that it's would you read the book

690
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,960
no because there's going to be Peril

691
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:11,640
right cuz then you could put the words

692
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,240
they'll be that'll be even deeper

693
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,200
resonance cuz sometimes books really sck

694
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,279
to your ribs I mean at least for me

695
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,440
anyway like the pain of the characters

696
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,480
or whatever if there's things it just

697
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,159
haunts me for days and days so there's

698
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,360
an element of fear there to to to doing

699
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:30,200
that element of fear yes I'm I'm

700
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,120
frightened to read the life of pie and

701
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,919
now I can't go buy it because it'll be

702
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,399
with the movie picture cover on it and

703
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,760
you always feel like a douche getting a

704
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,039
book with the movie with the movie

705
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,679
poster on it when you should have read

706
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,600
that book years ago or like The Great

707
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,559
Gatsby I'm not buying it with Leo

708
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,960
DiCaprio on the cover it rarely ever

709
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,320
happens the other way I think it might

710
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,720
have at one or two two I'm trying to

711
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,360
think where like the movie would take on

712
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,600
the books cover with its uh mhm the

713
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,720
poster oh well I was supposed to have

714
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,760
read the Gatsby many years ago and

715
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,360
didn't and then I read it after the

716
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,799
movie came out but I went to a used

717
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,679
bookstore and got you didn't watch like

718
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,320
the Leonardo DiCaprio I didn't see the

719
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,240
movie I didn't see that either I'm just

720
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,320
saying um I I see the Robert Redford

721
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,240
movie of The Great Gatsby I would

722
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,200
imagine the Leonardo DiCaprio one

723
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,600
wouldn't be anything like the real Great

724
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,640
Gatsby book well the I didn't see it but

725
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,320
the the book The Great Gatsby which is

726
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,240
quite short was very very very good that

727
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,799
was one of my favorite books really good

728
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,760
when I read that I was in high school

729
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:31,760
and I I related so much to that part

730
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,399
where he would throw a party and watch

731
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,519
the party from the balcony but not

732
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:38,720
partake so I tried to do it at at home

733
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,600
and and I threw a party in high school

734
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,679
and I just stood in my parents bedroom

735
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,960
overlooking the backyard at the window

736
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,159
and everyone thought I was just such a

737
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,080
creep and did you feel a kind of uh Jay

738
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,720
Gatsby esque I was trying I wanted to be

739
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,080
the Gatsby but also I could only I kept

740
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,320
seeing M Pharaoh in the in the charact

741
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,559
in the feem daisy I think your name da

742
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,600
um because I had seen when I was younger

743
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,880
the the Robert Redford version but just

744
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,640
the trailers for The the big bold great

745
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
gadsby didn't appeal to me and the

746
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,760
soundtrack I don't need a s you know

747
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,039
what I mean I I think it's corny to Pump

748
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,360
It Up with a modern soundtrack cuz it

749
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,600
it's it's like it's saying you you won't

750
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,240
this is it's not enough on its own when

751
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,679
it's when it's clearly a great story

752
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,360
it's an arrogant thing to do be like

753
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,880
look this Great Gatsby it's not not so

754
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,919
great actually I know so we're going to

755
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,559
make it better with a modern soundtrack

756
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,159
called it Greater Gatsby yeah it's going

757
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,399
to it it would be you know the the

758
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,240
original not the original The Great

759
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,559
Gatsby movie I saw many years ago

760
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,080
certainly didn't do that if they had

761
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,399
done I guess of the time they would have

762
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,480
soundtracked by America the Rolling

763
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,720
Stones Bachman Turner overdrive it would

764
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,960
be the same thing because I think it

765
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,519
came out in that era Grand Funk Railroad

766
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,159
and then just as the years go by people

767
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,360
keep trying to top The Great Gatsby with

768
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,120
greater and greater greater greatest

769
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,559
gadsby this is the greatest gadsby yet

770
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,519
get a better Gatsby than this Gatsby

771
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,360
come Skrillex is going doing the entire

772
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,399
soundtrack there's going to be glow

773
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,159
sticks in the theater all right I'm

774
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,600
going to try to jump into this Tom rean

775
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,640
guy and find out a little bit about him

776
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Tom rean uh born November 28th 1938 is

777
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,320
an American philosopher who specializes

778
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:23,640
in animal rights theory he is a

779
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,679
professor emirus of philosophy it's I

780
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,039
see that written a lot too ameritus

781
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,080
ameritus I think that's how you know I I

782
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,360
don't know well no I'm I'm just guessing

783
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,880
but I feel like I'm so far away from

784
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,760
being that level of academic that I

785
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
can't even pronounce it I don't I don't

786
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,080
know that that's a litmus test of a you

787
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,200
know it's not like you hear that word

788
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,919
every single day yeah but you can't be a

789
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,960
professor and not know the word ameritus

790
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:49,240
ameritus I think I think I could be

791
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,559
wrong he's a professor ameritus of

792
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,360
philosophy at North Carolina State

793
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:57,320
University where he taught from 1967

794
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,360
until his retirement in 2001 he's the

795
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,600
author of numer books on philosophy of

796
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,039
animal rights including the case for

797
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,480
animal rights

798
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,120
1983 uh one of a handful of studies that

799
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,279
have significantly influence the modern

800
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,039
animal rights movement in these he

801
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,200
argues that non-human animals are what

802
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:18,480
he calls the subject of life just as

803
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,559
animal just as humans are and that if we

804
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,039
want to ascribe value to all human

805
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,720
beings regardless of their ability to be

806
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,639
rational agents then to be consistent we

807
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,720
must similarly have scrub

808
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,519
it to

809
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,679
nonhumans so he's arguing that that

810
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:35,960
actually makes a lot of sense if he's

811
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,519
saying if you give the right the rights

812
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,760
of of humanity and all that that implies

813
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,120
to people who are clearly not acting

814
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,880
rationally then shouldn't we apply to

815
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,039
animals apply to animals who actually

816
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,240
are acting rationally much more so than

817
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,639
a lot of humans so what he's saying is

818
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,320
and this it's funny I go back again to

819
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:55,720
thinking about George Carlin when he

820
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,240
said we have no rights you remember that

821
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,960
in one of his last special you don't

822
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,399
have rights rights are made up he said

823
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,799
oh he goes there is no such thing as

824
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:07,480
rights I oh I guess that's that's sort

825
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,399
of true but then there are some people

826
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,679
that I guess that would say that there

827
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:15,159
are rights that just that you exist that

828
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,600
you should have but I I think I

829
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,039
understand what he's saying is you are

830
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,200
told what your rights are rights are I

831
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,840
mean right to silent with any rights who

832
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,760
knows that you have you don't even know

833
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,000
that you do have a right to exist you do

834
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,559
exist do you have a right to exist

835
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,840
that's uh that's true I I would say that

836
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,440
once you're here out of the

837
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,960
womb it seems like people should help

838
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,919
you stay especially if you're a helpless

839
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,880
little baby or a helpless little animal

840
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,519
but is that a right I I yeah I I I I I I

841
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,760
don't recall him saying that that's a

842
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,720
very interesting yeah idea but I and

843
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,799
again I do take that point you are told

844
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,159
what your rights are right or but it

845
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,880
always did also bother me when people

846
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,480
say driving is a privilege whenever you

847
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,519
get a traffic ticket or something it's

848
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,799
not a a privilege it's a a Act of life

849
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,639
you I have to drive you know what I mean

850
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,120
in a modern society uh in order to get

851
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,039
to work or what have you so then what

852
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,159
isn't a privilege that then you could

853
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,320
yeah walking is a privilege or uh

854
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:13,320
everything's a privilege air airplane

855
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,159
travel is a priv air itself is a

856
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,360
privilege right yeah it's not a

857
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,760
privilege who are you to say what a

858
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,120
privilege is it's a strange thing when

859
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,360
people say driving is a privilege but

860
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,639
they would say that in driver's ed class

861
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,000
to in high school all the time remember

862
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:27,279
kids driving is a privilege it doesn't

863
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,760
seem like a privilege so much as

864
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,000
something that has to happen because in

865
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,559
order to survive in modern society in

866
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,159
most cases uh one needs to be able to

867
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,639
drive it's a better situation I don't

868
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,480
know if it's a privilege it's a better

869
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:45,200
situation than not being able it enables

870
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,880
you to live more fully right I guess cuz

871
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,440
and that's why they deny that right what

872
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,960
is a priv women drive like I wonder what

873
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,960
a privilege actually is what is a

874
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,799
privilege um a privilege I guess would

875
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,559
be a privileged person a person who was

876
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,240
born with Financial Security was born

877
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:09,520
with a roof over their head and and no

878
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,280
dangers put in front of them that and

879
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,919
then also had the ability to go to the

880
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,960
finest schools and right go on summer

881
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,240
vacations and all these things those

882
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,879
seem like a privileged lifestyle no

883
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,280
they're they're just entitled to a

884
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,200
better not entitled to but they were

885
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,359
just hand they were lucky enough to be

886
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,399
born into a situation so luck

887
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:34,879
luck luck luck luck luck some people uh

888
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:38,119
make their luck where through sheer will

889
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,839
intelligence hard work they become right

890
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,119
so then maybe driving is privileged

891
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,639
because you'd be lucky enough to drive

892
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,359
mhm but I mean it shouldn't be something

893
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,440
single that out as the privilege well

894
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm I'm just saying it's something I

895
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,000
remember from driver's ed and there are

896
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,119
also some countries that deny women the

897
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,359
right to drive because they know that it

898
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,880
it empowers people to drive so so they

899
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,800
don't have the right so there there

900
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,480
again as a as a man created right you

901
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,320
know they they should uh in a just

902
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,960
Society be able to drive humans should

903
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,480
be able to do what other humans are able

904
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,839
to do in a just Society in the same way

905
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,560
that here that in this country and many

906
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,359
other countries in the year 2013 we

907
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,480
should not be having discussions about

908
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,079
gay rights they should just be there

909
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,400
they're human rights right but going

910
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,599
back to what you were just saying humans

911
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,280
should be able to do what other humans

912
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,280
should be able to can do is where's the

913
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,480
line like could I say oh because I know

914
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,880
a human who has a a private jet and gets

915
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,000
to fly in a private jet I should

916
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,960
therefore no that's different I I

917
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,480
believe that is different and here's for

918
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,400
why I'm talking about the basic rights

919
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,440
to exist without apologizing or

920
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,760
defending

921
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:52,560
yourself women animals the LGBT

922
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,160
community uh very poor people things of

923
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,440
that nature uh these people should not

924
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,119
have to defend every political season or

925
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,520
every every year against some right-wing

926
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,280
or ignorant group their right to be MH

927
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,599
that's different than a private jet

928
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,720
which who cares uh you know when when it

929
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,839
comes down to it if you can ride a dve

930
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,319
if you can ride on a private jet that's

931
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,079
nice I mean I don't disagree at all with

932
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:17,560
what you're saying I'm just trying to

933
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,319
figure out at what point do you define

934
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:24,440
what a right is and in terms of as we

935
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:26,760
perceive them well I think I think in my

936
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,720
opinion the word right is we're kind of

937
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,800
stuck that's The American or the English

938
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,520
in our lexicon that we've used entitled

939
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,119
to right right means I should be

940
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,280
entitled to right or no because

941
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,839
entitlement carries its own baggage

942
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:46,160
people use it in a pejorative way I

943
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:47,880
feel that if if a like I said say a

944
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,880
newborn baby or

945
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,440
animal it shouldn't be snuffed out just

946
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,640
on on a precarious whim or because

947
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,400
somebody doesn't care that that seems

948
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,599
unkind and it seems wron that this this

949
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,400
thing new life doesn't have a chance um

950
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,119
that

951
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,920
there is it's not a privilege that it

952
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,079
gets to not be killed right it's a it's

953
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,680
it it

954
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,760
luckily has survived and somebody's

955
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,599
caring for it you just again there's

956
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,440
luckily right next to privileged because

957
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,319
luck and privilege might be the same but

958
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:29,040
I'm not using luck in that's that uh you

959
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:31,040
are you are granted luck I'm saying just

960
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,560
I should have said randomly happen

961
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,599
stance it didn't get snuffed out this

962
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,040
animal or this baby before it even had a

963
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,079
chance to

964
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:46,760
participate now having said that there

965
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,119
are um others that would say there is no

966
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,560
special you know I mean it doesn't

967
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,000
matter if if but I feel like in the case

968
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,200
of helpless things or things that do

969
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,839
need protection for survival it seems

970
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,040
very unjust to deny them that then when

971
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,680
it comes to adults though

972
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,720
who

973
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:13,119
um behave in a way that is endangers

974
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:18,160
others or is incendiary like say uh uh

975
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:20,839
that that guy who um a few years ago

976
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,440
deliberately was I guess burning krans

977
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:25,920
just to incite violence that seems

978
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,560
absolutely wrong now the person who was

979
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,520
burning the cran or verely any other

980
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,520
place in the world provoking or doing

981
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,880
anything that Pro that I don't care

982
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,640
actually if they are put In Harm's Way a

983
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,880
person doing that how do we know I mean

984
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,960
in this case it seems fairly obvious but

985
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,960
how do we know when somebody is acting

986
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,119
in a way that endangers us but

987
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,560
ultimately will help us like a

988
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:52,599
revolutionary say you're in you're in

989
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,720
Syria um and now but maybe not right now

990
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,040
but maybe let's go back a year or

991
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,800
whatever before things got or at least

992
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,400
to my knowledge got really bad so things

993
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,760
are really bad but you're like you know

994
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,680
what this is tolerable I think uh or

995
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,400
Egypt's a better example um this is this

996
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,680
is they're like oh it's bad and people

997
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,040
are like no we need to revolt they're

998
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,440
like don't Revolt that's just going to

999
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,160
incite the powers of being what are you

1000
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,240
doing you know what are you nuts uh and

1001
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,520
then they do things that could be

1002
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,160
perceived to those people again bad

1003
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,440
example with the guy burning the Quran

1004
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,960
but just just to have one they could

1005
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,800
perceive that as oh what are you doing

1006
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,280
this guy is just you know trying to you

1007
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,760
know and ultimately what they're doing

1008
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,480
is for the greater good of society I

1009
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,599
don't live there I can't I can't weigh

1010
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,440
in very effectively on the motivations

1011
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,839
or intentions of of anything and

1012
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,839
unfortunately a lot of the news that I

1013
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:51,000
get even though I try very hard to get

1014
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,839
multiple sources and and to to to figure

1015
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,480
out what's going on I can never know

1016
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,560
what's going on and also when people say

1017
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,520
oppressed societies and democracy those

1018
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,040
are all very relative terms there is no

1019
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,000
such thing as an actual real democracy

1020
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,880
because the human condition won't allow

1021
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,359
it um and you think it never will I

1022
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,079
don't know I don't know uh you know

1023
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,359
certainly things are better in that we

1024
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,760
don't live in the in the streets and

1025
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,760
squalor you know elderly you know that

1026
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,800
that's changing back in some ways but

1027
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,400
then as right-wing pendulums swing and

1028
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,839
and funds get cut from things and

1029
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,839
threats to take away Social Security it

1030
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,319
could be the way it was back in the old

1031
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:32,839
days uh where the elderly just died in

1032
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,200
the streets who knows what can happen

1033
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:37,480
I'm often amazed and I I wonder if it's

1034
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,359
attributed to order in the universe of

1035
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,680
just how few bullets are flying by at

1036
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,599
any given moment when you walk depends

1037
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,200
on where you live down the street well

1038
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,400
well why does even depend on where you

1039
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,079
live people could jump on a subway and

1040
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,760
and just start shooting anywhere right

1041
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,359
they could they could um and and

1042
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,319
sometimes they do and then there's some

1043
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,920
soci some uh blighted urban areas and

1044
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:02,599
even rural areas where it is like that

1045
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,680
people get shot constantly the amount of

1046
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:08,119
homicides and uh gun injuries and gun

1047
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,640
deaths in this country on a daily basis

1048
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,480
is insane but I wonder what keeps the

1049
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,440
people from doing like I'll give you

1050
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,480
another

1051
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,040
example you're on the subway you always

1052
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,040
see these ad Suicide Hotline yeah uh

1053
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,560
depression all kinds of pills for

1054
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,160
depression clearly a huge a large

1055
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,839
segment of just local people here in New

1056
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,280
York that are suicidal

1057
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,760
and well that's not necessarily true the

1058
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,720
pharmaceutical industry has like a huge

1059
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,680
investment in putting those signs

1060
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,359
up you don't think that there's a lot of

1061
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,480
suicidal people all around oh there

1062
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:39,599
could be and there there always has been

1063
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,079
the probably the same amount I mean

1064
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,680
there's the level of

1065
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,760
suicides uh in

1066
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,160
society has probably always been fair

1067
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,920
you know people used to do it just out

1068
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,839
of sheer Bleak despair on the Prairie um

1069
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,160
again you know depression is a very real

1070
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,119
thing uh but certainly the

1071
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,520
pharmaceutical industry will medic and

1072
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,720
diagnose everyone there's no way every

1073
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:05,160
kid has ADD and ADHD there's just no way

1074
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,400
that the amount of kids who are

1075
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,520
medicated have these receed they're

1076
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,160
selling products they're selling

1077
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:15,480
products to a willing a willing uh you

1078
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,079
know consumer base in the same way that

1079
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,520
there's if you ever watch uh certain

1080
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,640
cable news channels every other

1081
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,880
commercial is for restless leg syndrome

1082
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,640
low tea all these manufactured things

1083
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,319
that are just a a a byproduct of aging

1084
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,079
process they give you enough Sy symptoms

1085
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:32,960
that you're like at least I have one of

1086
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,760
them you know it could be anything you

1087
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,400
know what I mean so ask your doctor and

1088
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,760
then the side effects will kill you of

1089
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,960
these medications I wonder if they're

1090
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,040
just sitting there like can we come up

1091
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,800
with a few more symptoms for this just

1092
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,880
so we could grab another absolutely in

1093
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,559
the same way that if you look at the

1094
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,400
charts that diagnose children with

1095
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:52,280
various things you see it is the widest

1096
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,079
net possible the ad ADHD for kids thing

1097
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,079
is literally

1098
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,440
every any child my D I'm like but I

1099
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,480
really have it Janine but that you might

1100
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,040
and you might not uh but if you were

1101
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,280
born when I was born you would have

1102
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,480
never heard of it and there I didn't

1103
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,559
even know anyone that knew anyone I

1104
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,359
started kindergarten around 6869

1105
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,559
graduated college in ' 86 there was no

1106
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,280
such thing that I had ever heard of

1107
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:21,200
called a nut allergy there was honestly

1108
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,720
there was peanut butter was fine um the

1109
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,559
food allergy thing there was always a

1110
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,640
bumblebee kid you heard about it I never

1111
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,880
met him but there was a like a Suburban

1112
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,440
legend about there was a kid stung by a

1113
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,880
bee and he died uh that you would hear

1114
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,640
about that other than that uh I wonder I

1115
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,319
wonder if it if it's what you're saying

1116
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,599
which is that it's manufactured by a

1117
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,920
pharmaceutical company no no there

1118
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,240
definitely was going on diagnosed we as

1119
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,440
a as a race as a species sure there's

1120
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,319
there's many contingencies first of all

1121
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,119
there was many things not understood and

1122
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:54,000
and not diagnosed right that's how he's

1123
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,559
been true in history but to go from

1124
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,040
none in in the average public school

1125
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:03,680
body right to in the last 10 12 Years to

1126
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,040
all that you can't bring peanut butter

1127
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,000
within 25t of a school yard a gun you

1128
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,000
can but not peanut butter not be

1129
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,720
symptomatic of the drugs that they gave

1130
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,079
people in your generation that their

1131
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,880
kids wound up with all these or it could

1132
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,520
be power of

1133
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,760
suggestion uh it's just it's just it

1134
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,319
just seems that how could in one go

1135
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,480
round of a

1136
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:26,800
generation their chromosomes and

1137
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,839
genetics are all mixing together and

1138
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,079
every kid now has whatever the flavor of

1139
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,480
the month allergy is or whatever the

1140
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,960
pharmaceutical industry will tell you

1141
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,640
that you have but if you look at most

1142
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,559
children can't sit still doesn't want to

1143
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,920
pay atten that is the nature of being a

1144
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,680
child what we what a lot of it is is is

1145
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,839
these children exhibiting behaviors that

1146
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,240
we as adults find annoying especially

1147
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:49,280
overstressed teachers who have an

1148
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,599
enormous amount of kids in their

1149
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,200
classroom

1150
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:55,960
underfunded uh you know and they would

1151
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,079
prefer that these kids be quieter be

1152
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,960
funny if doctors just diagnosed well I'm

1153
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,359
sorry well you just have an annoying

1154
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,440
child well isn't that what a lot of it

1155
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:06,160
is like your kid has a lot of energy

1156
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,319
yeah you know I mean like your kid talks

1157
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,760
when I'm talking that's what's he got

1158
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,040
doctor well according to these charts

1159
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,079
he's very he very annoying so let's

1160
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,800
medicate him but you know ADD and ADHD

1161
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:21,119
which I I actually am fascinated by uh

1162
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,160
can't it also be just a personality type

1163
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,760
can it also be just the product of the

1164
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:30,119
way your mind works why is it a a thing

1165
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,960
that now is codified as perhaps negative

1166
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,079
and you need to take medication um in

1167
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,960
the same way there's a new thing called

1168
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:36,359
fibromyalgia for the last few years

1169
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,760
which again is another catchall thing

1170
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:40,200
you have pain vaguely in any joint take

1171
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,440
this pill ask you talk about

1172
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,119
fibromyalgia or restless leg or they

1173
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,000
just come up new names all the time they

1174
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,839
Rebrand it rename it they'll Trot out

1175
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,520
some other medicine medication that

1176
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,760
didn't take off in another Market it

1177
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,520
sounds like a word you've never heard

1178
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,599
you're like oh it's got to be LCA right

1179
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,520
now they medicate your fibromyalgia

1180
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,280
which is nonsense with lria used to be

1181
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,920
an anti a present uh they just switched

1182
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,480
it over

1183
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:07,160
to uh for your for your fibromyalgia

1184
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,400
your restless leg uh just one of those

1185
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,640
things and that low tea thing is

1186
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,119
hilarious to me that is uh has your

1187
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,319
testosterone lowered after the age of 40

1188
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,920
yes if you're a man that's after the age

1189
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,520
of 25 it starts to go down supposed to

1190
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,359
but they say you may be just you like

1191
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,559
the you know the commercial play into

1192
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,520
your insecurities playing into your

1193
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,480
insecurities ask your doctor you may be

1194
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,800
suffering from low tea as if it's a

1195
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,839
thing people say they should just say

1196
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,960
maybe you're not so much of a man I know

1197
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,760
ex that's exactly right and and for

1198
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,280
women they do it in other ways uh that

1199
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,000
their femininity is in question their

1200
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,520
sexuality is in question just by

1201
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,520
refusing to say this is what happens

1202
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,920
after the age of 30 this is what you

1203
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,880
know what I mean it's these things are

1204
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,880
going to change and also now that people

1205
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,319
live to about 100 there's going to be

1206
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,200
even way more and we're going to

1207
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,800
medicate those even the elderly are like

1208
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,160
well why don't I have an erection I know

1209
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,480
exactly they can take pills to do in the

1210
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,760
same way that you took Aderall and

1211
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,200
sometimes I take Aderall cuz I do like

1212
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,720
that too it it makes me really zero in

1213
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,720
on something but it doesn't mean I have

1214
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,760
a problem and again I'm not I'm not

1215
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,960
absolutely saying don't I'm not taking

1216
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,319
it away from my high definition AD yeah

1217
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,800
yeah it's it's I it's perhaps the way

1218
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:21,200
your mind worked and uh you obviously

1219
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,040
went into a type of line of work that

1220
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,800
interest you that is similar to what you

1221
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,440
were doing as a kid right right in your

1222
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,520
notebook or in your world or in your

1223
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,240
head where you were that's where you are

1224
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,960
now so before we wrap it up uh would you

1225
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,520
do the honors of reading one or two

1226
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,280
paragraphs of I would indeed which

1227
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,400
philosopher here you can pick and choose

1228
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,160
I always there's a few pages and you can

1229
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,440
always let people hang on Grandma's got

1230
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:49,280
to take her glasses off to read I

1231
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,240
actually have uh bifocals and they're

1232
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,079
not working do you have the inability to

1233
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:59,240
read after the age of toxicity tests of

1234
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,280
cosmetics ftis oh I'm talking about the

1235
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,359
animals here stop if you cared at all

1236
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,559
about the animals apologize toxicity

1237
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:07,960
tests of Cosmetics on animals violates

1238
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,880
their rights but important medical

1239
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,040
research cancer research for example

1240
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,200
does not the clubbing of babies he's

1241
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,880
using that's not what Tom rean is saying

1242
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:20,000
he's actually uh saying that that's

1243
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,240
people's logic so it I didn't want it to

1244
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,160
sound like he's saying it doesn't

1245
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,240
violate their rights to to do medical

1246
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,640
research he he believes that it does um

1247
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,520
medical research for example does not

1248
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,559
the clubbing of baby seals is aor but

1249
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,960
not the harvesting of adult seals again

1250
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,480
he's not advocating he's saying that's

1251
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:40,440
how people think um you don't change

1252
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,839
unjust institutions by tidying them up I

1253
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,160
guess what he means is by putting it in

1254
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,520
convenience acceptable not again what's

1255
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,240
wrong fundamentally wrong with the way

1256
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,839
animals are treated isn't the details

1257
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,240
that vary from case toase is the whole

1258
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:52,760
system the forlornness of the V calf is

1259
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,599
pathetic heart-wrenching the pulsing

1260
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,079
pain of the chimp with electrod actually

1261
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,119
I can't even go on because I know when

1262
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,280
you see those I'm so sorry but uh

1263
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:03,599
corporate farming and the medical tests

1264
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,960
on on on animals if you've seen

1265
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,000
documentaries about it and you see what

1266
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,119
exactly what he's saying the forlorn

1267
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,880
sadness and depressed it's I'm life of

1268
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:17,559
ping right now I can't continue to read

1269
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,839
sorry that's okay uh it's uh I I

1270
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:21,160
absolutely in theoretically would agree

1271
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,920
with everything he's saying here because

1272
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,520
I assume he's on the same on the same

1273
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,720
track as me but now I am thinking about

1274
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,760
those documentaries where they show the

1275
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,280
monkey

1276
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,880
suffering terribly so that's an

1277
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,559
interesting question though um let's say

1278
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,240
they could find a cure for cancer but

1279
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,359
the only way right but that's that's a

1280
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,079
false opposition false I'm just saying

1281
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,280
in in theory just for the sake of

1282
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,880
argument right the only way to do it

1283
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,799
would be to and I'm I'm sure there is

1284
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,319
another way mhm but the only way to do

1285
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:54,079
it would be to experiment on an animal

1286
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,480
in that case do we well I don't know

1287
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,319
because again it's a hypothetical so

1288
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,359
what's the point uh never we've first of

1289
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,200
all at this point if they haven't cured

1290
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:06,559
cancer I also feel like how much more

1291
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,440
money and time does uh collectively the

1292
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,240
world need to to seem to get its arms

1293
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,440
around this thing it I feel like there's

1294
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,119
monetary reasons uh it's a business it's

1295
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,000
a huge business I don't know this for

1296
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:23,359
sure it just feels odd to me that with

1297
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,319
so much energy time and money for years

1298
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,880
and years and years having been put

1299
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:30,000
towards cancer research that many of the

1300
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,000
treatments are still very similar to

1301
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,240
when I was my mom passed away of cancer

1302
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,240
like many people's parents and relatives

1303
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,000
almost everyone gets cancer seemingly

1304
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,799
I'm not I'm not downplaying it I'm I'm

1305
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
bringing this up merely to uh to make a

1306
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:47,000
larger point that in 20 30 years ago

1307
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,799
when my mom passed away many of the same

1308
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,640
treatments are still in play today all

1309
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:54,319
so little progress has been made I'm not

1310
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:57,400
saying that uh progress hasn't been made

1311
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:59,400
it has but to be used using some of the

1312
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,559
very same things that I'm seeing now on

1313
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,599
other relatives that literally a feels

1314
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,480
like a lifetime ago were being used on

1315
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,559
my mother who of course uh did not in

1316
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,960
any way benefit from any of these

1317
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,599
grueling procedures as most people don't

1318
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,319
uh some people do if you catch it early

1319
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:19,359
enough obviously there are many success

1320
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:21,520
stories but for the most part uh I don't

1321
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,119
really see the logic in putting people

1322
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,040
through what they go through especially

1323
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,280
when the cancer is not particularly

1324
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,480
found early enough it's it's a very

1325
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,720
expensive very physically grueling

1326
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:38,920
painful process for the patient and um

1327
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:44,640
the the to to continually test not just

1328
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:46,720
for medical reasons but uh cosmetics and

1329
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,799
other things that is absolutely not

1330
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,240
necessary to use animals for and to

1331
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:57,079
continue to farm in such an inhumane way

1332
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:59,839
where the life of these animals is

1333
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,319
misery just abject misery they in their

1334
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:04,559
entire lives never move an inch some of

1335
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:07,000
the cattle with Twisted necks literally

1336
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,319
from growing up in in a

1337
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,760
crowd uh and the despair raising and

1338
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:16,040
owning chickens by the way which I did

1339
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:20,319
in Brooklyn changed the way I eat meat

1340
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:24,040
forever I I won't eat anything that's

1341
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,359
not free range uh kosher me or may well

1342
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,880
sometimes it's not free range but I try

1343
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:30,040
to get well even with that cuz I I take

1344
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,760
your point but I even feel badly about

1345
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:35,040
that because it it feels wrong to that

1346
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,400
the whole job seemingly of these animals

1347
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,400
is to feed us uh it even if they're

1348
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:45,520
human Heritage uh locally sourced Farm

1349
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:48,200
to Table uh the chicken so you're still

1350
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,760
killing it for someone to eat that's its

1351
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,799
whole it what and I feel like a lot of

1352
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,440
these animals and and I have eaten meat

1353
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:57,720
I I do eat meat on occasion uh not very

1354
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,839
much but I I and unfortunately you know

1355
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,119
obviously we have worn uh leather uh

1356
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,400
things like that uh so I'm not saying

1357
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,559
I'm this

1358
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,200
innocent right moral person but I try

1359
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,480
very much to stay away from me as as

1360
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,680
much as I can and to stay away from

1361
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,680
products that animals have been harmed

1362
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:21,000
in in in these products coming to me um

1363
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,839
I almost I mean that the corporate

1364
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,520
farming thing or even puppy mills to

1365
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:30,880
provide certain breeds of dogs for the

1366
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:33,040
consumer um the life of or uh the the uh

1367
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,440
animals that are done for medical and

1368
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,680
psychological research where they put

1369
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,839
animals in deliberately perilous

1370
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,160
situations to study their

1371
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:46,079
behavior uh I find abhorent and the

1372
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,280
conditions these animals live in and

1373
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,680
then they are just either killed or are

1374
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,160
sent to an even worse situation to just

1375
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:56,599
die on their own in a field right um

1376
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:00,119
it's it is indicative of a society of

1377
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:02,319
how it treats its children it animals

1378
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,960
its elderly and the environment when I

1379
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,960
was younger I S try and think okay maybe

1380
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,480
this animal that's suffering terribly

1381
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,119
was in a past life a oppressor of some

1382
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,559
kind that made others lives miserable

1383
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:18,079
and and if there was Justice in the

1384
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:20,119
universe then it came back as this but I

1385
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,440
thought but it doesn't know right that

1386
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,440
so there's not just plus I don't believe

1387
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,280
in a just I don't believe there's a that

1388
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,480
the Universe tilts towards Justice

1389
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,400
you're you're creating reincarnation I

1390
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,119
was I was trying to find a way around

1391
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,880
some of the suffering when I was younger

1392
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,559
I've thought about that and I know I

1393
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,559
Kylie and I watched a documentary about

1394
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,200
this guy who beat these dogs like

1395
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,839
brutally beat these dogs it was very

1396
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:47,240
hard to watch um and uh I was thinking

1397
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:49,240
to myself if there if there's a hell I

1398
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,520
hope it's that he comes back as those

1399
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,200
dogs and with the knowledge of what he

1400
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,799
did to them the knowledge has to be

1401
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,920
there though has to then face himself in

1402
00:54:55,799 --> 00:55:00,599
human form

1403
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,920
as the dog and and and know but but it

1404
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,839
won't be worth it if he doesn't know if

1405
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,880
if the knowledge isn't retained through

1406
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,680
the Journey to reincarnation then it's

1407
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,359
just another dog suffering right I got

1408
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,119

1409
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:15,119
