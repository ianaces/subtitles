getting them as much as you but I'm I'm

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,720
finally starting to uh I used to reject

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000
them right away when somebody that's

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,760
good then you had the proper uh

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,239
childhood to be a comedian yeah I'm

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,440
reading that new Johnny Carson book you

72
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,280
got to you got to read it man the one

73
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,200
that his lawyer wrote his mother was

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,480
brutal brutal really one of the stories

75
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,519
not going to ruin the book but a quick

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,440
excerpt he he sent his uh he sent his um

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,640
parents on a trip around the world 48

78
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,159
day trip they saw the world so they're

79
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,760
like 30 days in on the trip and uh they

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,080
haven't called them haven't you know

81
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,760
nothing didn't check in or anything yada

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,239
yada they get back and he's waiting for

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,879
the phone call they're home for five

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,560
days no phone call so according to the

85
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,840
book now this isn't Johnny saying this

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,120
you know so take it with a grain of salt

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,599
but according to this lawyer he said

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,200
Johnny calls a his mom up after 5 days

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,640
and just like

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,200
mom and she's like yeah hey he's like uh

91
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,200
how was it and she's just like oh Johnny

92
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,879
we're just so happy to be

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,680
home so he used to I guess relay these

94
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,560
it was a very like standup comic thing

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,120
where he would relay these

96
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,640
stories of um unbelievable hurt and pain

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,400
with his mom to his lawyer and his

98
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,760
lawyer after hearing the story would

99
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,920
then just laugh and then Johnny would

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,200
laugh and I and I thought like that was

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:04,159
really like the the backbone

102
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,040
of uh just how when you you you you go

103
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,280
down the comedian route where if you

104
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,239
actually like oh my God Danny that's so

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,120
I feel so bad for you blah blah blah

106
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,959
blah then you're an actual like human

107
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,320
being and you're probably going to get a

108
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,560
real job but if you just start laughing

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,199
right you have that uh I don't know that

110
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,720
thing that makes what makes me love and

111
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,520
hate all

112
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,520

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,120
that one though that's a good one too

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,600
that's uh Woody goes to his parents and

121
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,880
they're like in their 90s and it's I

122
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,000
don't know if it was done like maybe 10

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,400
15 years ago not that long ago mhm and

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,199
uh there's these two 90-year-old people

125
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,360
his parents are sitting there and

126
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,720
they're still not proud of him at all oh

127
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,720
they're still uh they're still saying

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,880
they wish he would have gone into

129
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,560
there's got to be something out there

130
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,720
like like where you can detox from

131
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,440
heroin same kind of thing where there's

132
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,560
got to be something where you can detox

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
from parental Improvement if it's just

134
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,479
terminal I got great parents thank God

135
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,800
they they've always said that they're

136
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,560
proud of me and they totally encourag me

137
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,280
and everything um but there has to be uh

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,039
at some point you got to take control of

139
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,560
your life and just be like look this has

140
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,600
nothing to do with me this has to do

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,400
with whatever the hell happened to them

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,960
as kids and I need to to break this

143
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,440
thing because I definitely through

144
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,680
reading this Carson book like there's a

145
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,600
lot of stuff that he does that I

146
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,440
completely relate to there's a lot of

147
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,000
things like you know the compliments he

148
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,800
doesn't like compliments there's a lot

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,639
of the U when somebody really needs him

150
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,360
it causes them to be cold and wall them

151
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,400
off I'm not that guy anymore but I used

152
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,360
to be like that and that that definitely

153
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,440
comes from you know uh similar sort of

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,080
background it it it's just like an I

155
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,600
don't know I think like an East Coast I

156
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,800
don't know what it is no he was from

157
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,080
Nebraska but my parents were from

158
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,000
Midwest so I don't know I know if it's

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,280
that there's

160
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,759
that just uh there that um I don't know

161
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,160
there's people who are just touchy

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,280
trying to regionalize it but I think

163
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,919
it's it's probably spread out amongst

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
everybody yeah yeah I don't know just

165
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,240
well I just kind of related to the a

166
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,360
little bit of the the the

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,880
coldness I just think coldness is too

168
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,120
harsh to say about my upbringing it was

169
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,479
just not you know it was the love was

170
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,440
implied you know what I mean like I got

171
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,680
hit by a car when I was a kid and my

172
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,440
mother her response was well that's what

173
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,720
you get for riding the street you idiot

174
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,360
and that was

175
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,000
her she she was angry I think at the

176
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,639
love she had for me and the fear of

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,720
losing me oh yeah so rather than like

178
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,400
going oh my God I don't ever use yeah it

179
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,120
becomes like this you get mad if you

180
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,160
could detox from having those kind of

181
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,319
parents and then you knew that the risk

182
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,000
of doing so might be might be less funny

183
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,080
Would You Do

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,080
It um I don't think you can become less

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,400
funny so I would do it you really don't

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,160
think you become yeah there's there's

187
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,840
that thought that don't get too happy

188
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,080
don't lose your Edge don't mellow out

189
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,560
don't blah blah blah it's just like you

190
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,039
know I I don't think I think that's a

191
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,520
fear a lot of us have is that you can

192
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,240
become less funny you don't think it's

193
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,319
possible no no because you you what you

194
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,919
have is the you can now what you can do

195
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,400
is laugh at your well I've gotten to the

196
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,120
point now where I laugh at myself I

197
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,240
still have the temper but I'm not the

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,280
angry guy I was in my 20s and 30s where

199
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,039
it was literally consuming my guts it

200
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,400
felt like um now it's like you know I'm

201
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,919
flipping out and I'm as I'm doing it I'm

202
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,720
observing myself going look at you

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,160
losing your temper again so I mean I've

204
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,199
kind of gotten to that point and then

205
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,800
when I'm on stage where back in the day

206
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,840
I think it was more of like you know

207
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,039
have you gone to these cell phone stores

208
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,680
what's up with that it's more like now

209
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,039
I'm kind of taking it from a place of

210
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,479
like so I go to the cell phone store you

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,800
know I'm a real impatient guy and I pick

212
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,080
out the stuff that bugs me but I'm also

213
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,840
sort of like psychologically breaking

214
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,440
down uh what an idiot I am for always

215
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,680
taking the bait and getting this mad

216
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
over a cell phone or or or or what

217
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,360
whatever the hell it is I'm trying to do

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,800
so and I and I think that it adds a

219
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,520
uniqueness to what you're doing as

220
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,759
opposed to I mean there's enough it's

221
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
more self-aware you know it's definitely

222
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,039
more self-aware but I'll try and use

223
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,639
that as a transition to get into

224
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:26,720
philosophy our philosophy um so the guy

225
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,360
Alex picked for you is Adam Smith and uh

226
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,960
he that might be the most boring name

227
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,479
ever for a philosopher I thought it was

228
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,839
going to be some sort of Greek name Adam

229
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,080
Smith just Adam

230
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,479
Smith did he change his name to that

231
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,200
because what's in a

232
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
name probably had some 20 syllable last

233
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,320
name all right Adam Smith Adam Smith uh

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,560
I usually say when he lived from he was

235
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,519

give them the no but what beyond that

304
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,800
they're expressing exactly what I'm

305
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,040
feeling the second I get on there and

306
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,639
I'm like oh God another 5 hour flight or

307
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,040
whatever 10hour flight depending on

308
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,040
where I'm going they're just honest you

309
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,160
love their honesty I would love to be

310
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,959
able to do that let out a whale and just

311
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,519
get it out of you you know so just when

312
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,880
I watch people putting their jackets in

313
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,800
the overhead compartment as they're

314
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,399
saying don't put your jackets up there

315
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,839
and they're deliberately ignoring it and

316
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,279
in that moment I see why it's never

317
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,279
going to work like how people are never

318
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,639
it we're never going to get to a Utopia

319
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,440
yeah just in that moment of watching

320
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,040
that guy as they're like you know people

321
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,760
please don't put your jackets up in the

322
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,519
overhead compartments until all the bags

323
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,240
are up there and somebody stuffing this

324
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm going to Antarctica snorkel jacket

325
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
up there when I just see that that

326
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,200
selfishness yeah and I'm not judging the

327
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
guy because I can relate because I'm

328
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,480
selfish and I just just look at it and

329
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,560
they go that's right there is the reason

330
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,800
yeah that right there is the seed of why

331
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,519
we're never going to we're never going

332
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,120
to get along I kind of I think that's

333
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,680
good too I I don't know if I'd want to

334
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,279
live in a Utopia it'd be too boring

335
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,920
there'd be nothing there's nothing to

336
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,639
strive for I yeah which is why I don't

337
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,279
have that desire for the afterlife with

338
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,079
you go to heaven you go to heaven to me

339
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,079
people are still breaking

340
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,279
balls and like there's still the

341
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,279
pettiness you still see somebody like

342
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,480
like trying to pick something up with

343
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
their foot cuz they don't want to get

344
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,760
off the couch and you know and take some

345
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,120
an extra two minutes just watching human

346
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,639
behavior like that like if it's like

347
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,000
this I don't who knows I mean obviously

348
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,639
nobody knows what happens when you die

349
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,279
obviously maybe you go to some Enlighten

350
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,760
thing I think it's over I mean it makes

351
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,000
sense that it's over and I think that

352
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,639
you

353
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,279
know and people well life is too short

354
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,560

355
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,600
the highest level being right you really

356
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,680
hit the lottery you mean what if flies

I mean or like you know you watch these

359
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,399
Discovery things where for the most part

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,600
you're going to die by getting eaten

361
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,040
alive murdered or something if you're

362
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,959
lucky it's a big cat and they'll just

363
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,600
kind of choke you out UFC style except

364
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,639
they use their mouth but like you know

365
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,639
the kodo dragon is just that's just the

366
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,560
most brutal one do you give much thought

367
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,199
to to that stuff to the afterlife to God

368
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,639
the existence or do you just sort of not

369
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,519
as much as I used to I I uh I don't know

370
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,720
if it's arrogance or whatever but I just

371
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,240
I once I I was able to kind of wrap my

372
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,360
head around that religions are all based

373
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
in the

374
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,120
same uh just natural feeling you have

375
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,800
that if you do something good you feel

376
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,240
good if you do something bad you feel

377
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,800
bad um that moral compass thing that

378
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,000
once I just kind of looked how they they

379
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,920
just sort of

380
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
exploit all of it and it's hypocritical

381
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,199
and you know just the

382
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,240
whole that like you know people who get

383
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,600
super religious like there's people who

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,160
get so religious that they commit murder

385
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
because some somebody says something bad

386
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,680
against their religion and the fact that

387
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,639
they can still think that they're going

388
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,600
to be in the eyes of this higher power

389
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:12,800
as something good is uh it's frightening

390
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,440
and I think what religion does either

391
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,560
deliberately or inadvertently is it

392
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
perverts the your moral compass of doing

393
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,560
good things makes you feel good doing

394
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,959
bad things makes you feel bad and like

395
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,720
look believe me dude if I you know when

396
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,279
I die if I am going to get judged I am

397
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,240
not going to make it I have done some

398
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,160
horrible horrible things and I would

399
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,519
literally I don't what I would have to

400
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,519
do I would have to save a city

401
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,320
single-handedly from a

402
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,399
fire while suffering you know third

403
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,720
degree burns just to get I think back to

404
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,800
even I'm like that like Gambler that's

405
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,560
just like I'm just down forever and I

406
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,600
should just walk away I'm never going to

407
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,079
get even I'm not even going to get close

408
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,399
so um you know I was a piece of [ __ ] for

409
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,279
too long so there you go that's

410
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,399
uplifting what about what if the what if

411
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,199
God is not tied to religion know what

412
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,079
I'm saying is God there's a Creator he

413
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,800
makes beings he puts them here and then

414
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,279
that's it hands off that's how I view

415
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,199
him that's how I view them like I don't

416
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,759
view like you you can't sit there and

417
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,680
make seven billion of something give

418
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,759
them freedom of choice and not think

419
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,360
that some sort of chaos is going to

420
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,600
ensue um I think Carlin or somebody said

421
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,160
something about how it's just his

422
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,759
entertainment he just made these things

423
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,079
to watch I feel like uh you do believe

424
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,680
that something made us a Creator made us

425
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,800
it's not just Rand

426
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,519
no I I I I have my honesty is I don't

427
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,000
know what happened I have no idea what

428
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:43,000
happened but I I am more likely to go I

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,120
go will go 70% science 30% philosophy

430
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,519
and 0% religion it's how I do it but I

431
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,000
like the the ground floor of every

432
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,800
religion where it's like you know you

433
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,160
know don't kill people honor your

434
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,319
parents don't steal and that type of

435
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,319
thing although I've broken a lot of

436
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:59,319
Commandments

437
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,880
um all right going back to money let's

438
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,600
talk about money a little bit so uh we

439
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,480
went we went for barley and flour and

440
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,319
gold right just thing to me seem like

441
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,440
things like a troll might give you yeah

442
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,560
for working but then but then the the

443
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,279
thing about it is is like getting mugged

444
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,920
then is way worse losing a City bank

445
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,079
card or your debit card as bad as that

446
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,240
is it'd be harder to mug you they have

447
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:26,399
to carry a whole sack of flour I know

448
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,120
but the

449
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,880
devastation of like if people get paid

450
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,240
barley and flour now I'm assuming that

451
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,319
you're making your own bread pastries

452
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,920
whatever the hell you're doing and like

453
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,800
you have chickens at home like that's

454
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,399
like you know they used to they used to

455
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,600
hang you for stealing horses and cattle

456
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,680
rustling because that was that was the

457
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,920
level it's like dude you're you're

458
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,480
[ __ ] with my ability to eat here um

459
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,240
so now that we have supermarkets you can

460
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,120
steal a car which is a modern-day horse

461
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,920
and you know you just it's that's is a

462
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,720
felony but I mean yeah you're not going

463
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,160
to get put to death well just the idea

464
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,720
like when I go overseas and do shows and

465
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,360
I have dollars on me and I I run out of

466
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,120
like whatever the currency is where

467
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,919
there and I oh sorry I only have dollars

468
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,720
they don't even want them and it just

469
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,319
makes you feel how useless and

470
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,240
meaningless this stuff is because once

471
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,959
you leave once you leave the they don't

472
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,120
believe in that God right they don't

473
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,480
believe in that they believe in their

474
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,600
God which has their guys on it no but

475
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,439
this is It's dollars it's you could buy

476
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,959
I work for this it's good I would love

477
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,000
to talk to somebody in Europe like what

478
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,880
was what was it like when you went from

479
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
like Deutch marks to Euros or Franks

480
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,280
Franks however you say it to to Euros or

481
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,360
whatever like I don't even know who's

482
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,720
who's on it and who isn't I know uh

483
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,320
England still has the pound but like

484
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,960
what that was like you know when you had

485
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,919
that old pair of golf pants in the back

486
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,559
where you got a $20 bill with your guys

487
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,160
on it you know and then all of a sudden

488
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,600
it's the Euro um I mean I don't believe

489
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,240
in all of that that that helps the

490
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,200
economy like I just believe that that

491
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,080
helps the banks sew up more territory it

492
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,840
helps people at the top do business more

493
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,200
I read a book recently where they you

494
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,960
know just the way that we approached

495
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,440
Japan and they didn't want to deal with

496
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,960
the outside world and how we just were

497
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,159
like no you're going to deal with us and

498
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,919
you're going to trade with us or we're

499
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,559
going to come back and basically start

500
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,000
shooting cannonballs at you it's just

501
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,320
like the the [ __ ] arrogance the

502
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
[ __ ] arrogance of it was is just it

503
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,720
was one of those things that you know I

504
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,039
read books and occasionally and I

505
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,080
immediately forget everything in them

506
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,919
but every once in a while there's

507
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,440
something that stands out and the the

508
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,559
[ __ ] arrogance to that I just

509
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,640
couldn't get I couldn't get past it what

510
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,840
what do you make of it when people say

511
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,360
oh China own owns us they that doesn't

512
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,080
translate into anything for me what do

513
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,799
you mean China they bought up our de on

514
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,200
paper but there's one of those things

515
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:49,320
where

516
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,440
uh I I think that that was uh golden

517
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,600
handcuffs where now they got drawn into

518
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,159
our horrific Financial mistakes and I

519
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,520
think that's all part of some sort of

520
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,640
brilliant plan to suck them into our

521
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,880
economy and get every body with the

522
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,200
money with the same guy's face on it

523
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,000
they'll probably have uh George

524
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,640
Washington on the front and one of their

525
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
their guys on the back and that'll be

526
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,440
the big battle how come we're on the

527
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,600
back and then the philosophers is going

528
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,159
to be like well there's really no front

529
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,039
and back if you look at it just depends

530
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,480
on where you're standing right right but

531
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,880
it doesn't mean anything for guys like

532
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,320
you and me right we're just the I think

533
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,200
it does I think that would be a major

534
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,720
shift if if all of a sudden uh you know

535
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,520
I have empathy for all these countries

536
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,679
that we occupy and we sit there and we

537
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,760
say that we're bringing them free

538
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,200
freedom and stuff and even if that is

539
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,520
just what we're doing which I never

540
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,679
believe in I think like I saw how much

541
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,440
they gave a [ __ ] about people in New

542
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,840
Orleans I saw how much they give a [ __ ]

543
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,880
about people who got screwed by bankers

544
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,960
and are upside down in houses right now

545
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,880
that they'll never get out from

546
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,440
underneath I saw how much they care and

547
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,640
this is allegedly their own people mhm

548
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,919
there's no

549
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,679
way they give a [ __ ] about anybody it

550
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,080
always comes down to like it's a Strate

551
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,520
IC point to put an army or there's some

552
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,000
sort of fluid in the ground that we want

553
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,679
or some sort of trees we want to cut

554
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,799
down it's it's an energy thing it's a

555
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,120
powered thing it's a strategic thing and

556
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,480
then they just dress it all up with like

557
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,600
you know sure we just can't stand that

558
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,760
you want to start a death metal band in

559
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,600
that country and your your dictator

560
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,520
won't allow you to do it you know right

561
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,799
yeah it's never genuine but they can't

562
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,120
they can't be that honest right they

563
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,280
can't be that honest without make and

564
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,760
make it go smoothly they can't say hey

565
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,360
we're here to take what's yours well

566
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,240
because they need regular people to

567
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,720
fight the war right cuz they're not

568
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,120
going to go and do it so what they have

569
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,039
to do is is give this righteous re they

570
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,880
have to have a right good reason for

571
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:48,080
doing it and who knows maybe they

572
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,720
actually believe it but um I I don't

573
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,120
know man I mean you go into the average

574
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,520
comedy club and there's all kinds of

575
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,000
schemes and crap going on and just like

576
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,799
don't I just I don't feel like you get

577
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,600
to it like I love how people like people

578
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,880
who aren't into conspiracy first of all

579
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
the immedately the first thing they do

580
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,559
when you say you're into conspiracy they

581
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,440
think oh you think there's flying

582
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,880
saucers and aliens and all that like

583
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,600
they make you out to be crazy for crazy

584
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,360
and I always just say well this country

585
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,120
came about through a conspiracy that's

586
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,559
how it came about people conspired and

587
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,440
if if they lost they would have been

588
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,799
hung for being a traitor sure but we won

589
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,000
so now they're Heroes and I think

590
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,440
there's an effort bill to make people I

591
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,480
think there's an effort coming from the

592
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,679
top to to say hey if you hear about

593
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,159
conspiracy they're crazy I think that

594
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,480
that's in I think that's a conspiracy

595
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,799
right there I think well I would

596
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,520
actually argue that it's

597
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:41,320
more you you you you are

598
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,919
defined by your uh beliefs no you're

599
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,440
defined by the least of you it's like

600
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:49,760
Jerry Springer Jerry Springer Show has

601
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,720
the worst example of every cross-section

602
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,760
of whatever you're going to do the

603
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,480
Southern Man the

604
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,200
africanamerican the the the Asian

605
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,440
whoever it's just it's never going to be

606
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,000
a good thing and I feel like with with

607
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,520
like conspiracy theorist you're going to

608
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,039
be defined by those people like that

609
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,559
that character Mel Gibson played in that

610
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,480
movie where he drove the cab and he had

611
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,039
all all the conspiracies but do you

612
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
think that there's there's a reason

613
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,120
there are people behind that to try and

614
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,320
be like look if anybody starts telling

615
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,200
you things aren't the way they are look

616
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,320
at these guys look at these examples we

617
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,200
put forward for you I I also think

618
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,880
conspiracy theorists are annoying like

619
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,240
it's like you're having a good day and

620
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,000
then they come along they tell you that

621
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,039
the money isn't worth anything saying

622
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,840
how the Sun is burning out the polar ice

623
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,919
caps are coming down and and you know

624
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,720
the bushes are buying up land in South

625
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,400
America it's all on aquafers and but at

626
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,840
some point I have to take a break yeah

627
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,880
but you have to hear it too right you

628
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,159
can't just shut it all out otherwise

629
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
you're just living mindlessly and you're

630
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,360
like I am living a good life be quiet be

631
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,240
quiet you're not living mindlessly I

632
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:57,520
don't feel you are because I I think

633
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,640
that it is um it's set up to it's we're

634
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,159
just this is our

635
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,799
destiny it's just whatever it is we're

636
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,600
staring it into the sun you don't think

637
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,760
we should fight fight for a better

638
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,120
Destiny or um try and control the one we

639
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
have yeah no no I would never say don't

640
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,039
do that but that's not my lot in life

641
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,799
like I'm not a uh I don't know how to

642
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,600
organize something like that all I know

643
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,799
is how to read about this stuff get

644
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
informed on it and then you like it

645
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,120
makes you overwhelmingly depressed you

646
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,080
try to talk to people about it oh you

647
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,080
one of them conspiracy theories yeah

648
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,440
what's going on on Saturn and you're

649
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,880
talking about

650
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,600
Banks and um so what I did was I just

651
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,240
look I educated myself as much as I

652
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,679
could to whatever the game was playing

653
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,480
where you know like I bought a house and

654
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,840
I have a mortgage okay now I could go

655
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,600
out and buy a bunch of flat screen TVs

656
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,880
and and widgets and all that crap and I

657
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,760
don't I don't have a dining room table I

658
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
have I drive a seven-year-old hybrid and

659
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,880
all I do every month is I knock the prin

660
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,559
principle down because I educated to

661
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,360
myself about how they frontend load the

662
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,919
interest and how if I took actually took

663
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,960
30 years I would pay two and a half

664
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,400
times the loan price and with the taxes

665
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,200
and the maintenance and all that I would

666
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,400
be lucky if I broke even and by the time

667
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,880
I pay it off I'm in the final third of

668
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,240
my life when the kidneys go or whatever

669
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,400
and then I have the and I know the deal

670
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,600
like they don't I'll tell you a quick

671
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,840
story I had some water damage on my

672
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,760
house and I had insurance so I put in

673
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,159
for the claim and when the insurance

674
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:38,440
money came it came to me it was made out

675
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,760
to me my wife and and the loan my my the

676
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,799
the the bank that that I have my

677
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,320
mortgage with so I call them up and they

678
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,640
and they told me that I had to sign the

679
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,440
check over to

680
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,440
them and I was like why I

681
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,200
go it's it's my insurance it's my money

682
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,679
and they go yeah well we have a vested

683
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,159
interest in the house in the property

684
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,840
it's like so do I I live here and I

685
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,320
start to understand what it is is they

686
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,799
own it they own it like when people buy

687
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,799
a house they go oh I own it it's like no

688
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,279
you don't own it you just switched

689
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,320
landlords now you have rather than a

690
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,279
landlord you have a banker so basically

691
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,080
like back in the day you got your

692
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,840
insurance money so I I basic I just kept

693
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,000
saying why and they go well because it's

694
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,960
an over $10,000 claim I said I know but

695
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
why they go I just explain it I said no

696
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,840
you told me what your policy is I want

697
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,840
to know the reasoning behind it and

698
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,520
basically what it is is too many people

699
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,360
nowadays when they were when they were

700
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,640
getting the insurance money they weren't

701
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,600
fixing the house they would just go buy

702
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,520
a car have a keg party do whatever they

703
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,279
they buy some sneakers whatever they did

704
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,640
and then they default on the loan and

705
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,320
and the banks would get the houses back

706
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
and not only did they have this house

707
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,080
they had to sell they also had a hole in

708
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,080
the roof and what it really was was they

709
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,440
[ __ ] over so many people they had so

710
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,880
many people upside down in houses paid

711
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,399
280 for a house that's now worth 210 and

712
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,399
it's got $10,000 worth of damage what do

713
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:54,520
I give a [ __ ] now I'm down 60 I'm going

714
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:55,840
to go and go buy a Dodge Challenger you

715
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,159
know put the top down or whatever

716
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,320
sunroof whatever you got in that car and

717
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,320
go drive around

718
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,919
so it's like they never lose it's like

719
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,760
you [ __ ] us and now I'm paying the

720
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,720
price and I dude I had to fix it a third

721
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,320
at a time and they come at me like I was

722
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,159
a child to make sure all the work was

723
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,880
done and they were inspected and

724
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,399
infuriated me so all it did was made me

725
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,080
work harder pay it off quicker and my

726
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:20,559
goal is to pay off the house before the

727
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,320
job's done so I can go all right now

728
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,559
it's mine you don't have a vested

729
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,279
interest anymore you know give me my

730
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,960
money back and like that whole

731
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,240
philosophy too where people sit there

732
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,200
and they have kids and they immediately

733
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,960
start saving up for their college

734
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,919
education I don't understand that at all

735
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,080
you're you're paying interest on your

736
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,720
mortgage

737
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,520
now if you knock that thing down you

738
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,320
have 18 years before your kid and if

739
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,799
your kid goes to school gives a [ __ ] get

740
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,399
a $30,000 loan versus a $300,000 one

741
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,640
that's frontend loaded on the interest

742
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:57,240
dude they are the biggest piece of [ __ ]

743
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,880
scumbags on the planet and they are

744
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,960
they're wait and they uncontrollable you

745
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,320
you'd have to you'd have to like

746
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,679
literally there have to be Bloodshed to

747
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,799
try to get the whole thing done that's

748
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:10,120
why I gave up because you know I it's

749
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,480
what would have to go down is insane to

750
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,320
get these guys stop you're talking about

751
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,559
guys who at the top get like bonuses of

752
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,720
10 million to $100 million bonuses

753
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,240
president makes 400 Grand a year the

754
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,960
alleged free leader leader of the free

755
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,960
uh world it's making 400 Grand there's

756
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,919
people with YouTube channels making what

757
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,840
Obama makes and he's supposed to keep

758
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,200
these guys in line

759
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,679
that's why I like Iceland Iceland told

760
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,159
them to go [ __ ] themselves it's like

761
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,760
like that's your debt you deal with it

762
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:37,039
the way I've always viewed it basically

763
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,440
is uh is that there's country clubs you

764
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,919
know like a country club that you join

765
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,279
and you know they don't want this person

766
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,840
or that person basically the world to me

767
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,120
the way I see it is just a bunch of

768
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,760
different country clubs and they're

769
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,760
playing with their toys you know 100%

770
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,159
agree I I just call them gangs like I

771
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,120
don't think you just like do you think

772
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,399
there's four guys running the planet no

773
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,080
I think there's four five 10 12 giant

774
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:03,559
groups right trying to join forces and

775
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,760
trying to figure I mean since the

776
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,679
beginning of time people have tried to

777
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,840
conquer the world the problem was it was

778
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,720
just too goddamn big and you would get

779
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,039
stretched out and then eventually the

780
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,919
you know the hillbillies came over the

781
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,559
hill the Huns whoever the rebels uh the

782
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,519
Yanks whoever they came out and they

783
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,880
knocked you out so I I but what's scary

784
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:29,039
to me is how they're they're ever so

785
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,320
slightly moving their way towards

786
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,080
um you there's no cash anymore so that

787
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,000
prevents you from stockpiling anything

788
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,919
in case you needed to rebel and then you

789
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,320
know all you know C cell phones and all

790
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,799
this crap are all tracking devices then

791
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,279
you know they already microchip dogs and

792
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,399
all it's going to take is that one

793
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:52,720
fraking case you know goig when it

794
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:56,360
happens where a kid gets kidnapped and

795
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,600
blah blah blah blah blah and and where I

796
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,240
would probably say that the kid get

797
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,360
saved and thank God and then immediately

798
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,279
I mean the the biggest fear any parent I

799
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,000
would think would have other than a

800
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,120
terminal disease would be that someone's

801
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,880
going to take their child and what's

802
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,679
going to happen is they're going to at

803
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,799
first it's going to be a bracelet and

804
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:15,559
then it's going to be like what if they

805
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,200
take the bracelet off and then it's just

806
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:19,039
going to be there's already corporate

807
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,840
guys that they got stuff they have

808
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,840
microchips and they SK scin I love it

809
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,640
too they like work for Coke it's like

810
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,440
what what the [ __ ] are you guys doing

811
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,080
there that you do you have a foreign

812
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,000
object in you I guess women get fake

813
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,200
boobs and they have plastic chemicals

814
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,840
like a big bag of plastic lunch bag of

815
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,039
chemicals under their titties which is

816
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,159
insane for me to do and what's going to

817
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,320
happen I feel is eventually like if

818
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,120
you're just born and it's always there

819
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,640
you don't question it like like federal

820
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,799
income tax and that type of you just

821
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,960
it's just it always has been so you

822
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,200
don't question it and I think that's

823
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,880
what they're going to do we'll die out

824
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,399
sure we just keep getting replaced and

825
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,760
replaced we're worker ants that are part

826
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,799
of a system and we just exist to help

827
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,799
these

828
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,399
no no no no but but I I believe that as

829
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,799
you have to have worker RS you do like

830
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:06,559
what the thing about conspiracy theory

831
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,840
that I don't like is I don't get so

832
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,279
liberal that I feel like everybody on

833
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,480
the bottom are these Saints and if that

834
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:15,039
they were in those positions they

835
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,519
wouldn't do the same thing like I don't

836
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,519
I don't think that either sure like

837
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,120
there's there's a lot of mouth breathing

838
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,840
morons that need to be dude I'm not

839
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,760
smart enough to to design a highway and

840
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,120
and have roads and system I mean like

841
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,960
this is if this is is ex like that

842
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,200
YouTube video about human farming and

843
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,720
all that if this really is you know

844
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,559
slavery I mean this is this is the this

845
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,720
is the Johnny Walker Blue top shelf of

846
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,279
slavery you know what I'm going to go do

847
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,080
right after this I'm going to go play

848
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,880
drums and I think tonight I'm going to

849
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,799
go see a movie cuz I tell jokes for a

850
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,880
living I'm killing it I don't want to be

851
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,799
running [ __ ] and I want you're not

852
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,200
you're are the exception too you know

853
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,720
that's that's not ex and also living in

854
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,440
this country I enjoy a level of Freedom

855
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,200
that is is

856
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,159
Indescribable but there's another thing

857
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,840
too like I I don't think that there you

858
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,279
know has to be sweat shops and all that

859
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,279
like I don't buy into that flossy that

860
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:12,840
if there wasn't a sweat shop that shirts

861
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,039
would then be 200 bucks for for a plain

862
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,279
T-shirt and it's just like yeah or you

863
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,360
could make less money I think there's

864
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,960
also enough shirts if there's enough

865
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,639
shirts that exist think they were making

866
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,960
shirts in this country when I was a kid

867
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,360
it didn't cost my mother I guess the

868
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,639
equivalent of 200 bucks in 1970 to

869
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,519
clothe her children it's complete

870
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,399
horseshit I think if they just sto

871
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,840
making shirts we could go for a good 10

872
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,120
years just reusing the ones we've got

873
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,320
you could went back to darning stockings

874
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,799
and churning butter yeah you know

875
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,639
feeling that soil must sound like Al

876
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:48,480
Gore um oh man and anybody listening I

877
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,960
realize that I am a [ __ ] so don't even

878
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,919
think that I remotely even think what's

879
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,799
a mouth breathing [ __ ] you said mou I

880
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,159
went to a Clippers uh Golden State

881
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,919
Warrior game the other day Stone sober I

882
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,799
was going through one of my twoe periods

883
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,320
not going to drink uh before I start to

884
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:07,440
miss it and uh and I basically in a

885
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,960
sober way was able to view my behavior

886
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,519
at games and I was appalled at myself

887
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,360
through these complete strangers that I

888
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,039
was watching I saw this this couple in

889
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,200
front of me and uh they were a drunk

890
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,679
mess it was funny they still loved each

891
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,639
other and every time she stood up he

892
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,840
started playing Bongos on her ass I mean

893
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:27,960
they were like in their 50s and at one

894
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,519
point at one point she was literally

895
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,320
feeding him nachos in the most lovingly

896
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,080
like lady in the [ __ ] kind of way and

897
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,480
stone sober watching it it was

898
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,279
absolutely disgusting and he kept

899
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,760
putting his arm around her and his elbow

900
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,919
kept hitting my knee and I finally had

901
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,720
to be like listen dude I'm not trying to

902
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,080
get in the way your love here but

903
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,279
elbowed me like 20 times in this quarter

904
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,320
but you're so drunk you don't know I

905
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:51,480
didn't say you're so drunk and then

906
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,080
immediately I'm the bad guy okay hey now

907
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,840
put my armor around my girl cutting down

908
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,039
on the love he said something like that

909
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,519
it's just IM meeting like that you know

910
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,840
that people look out their own heads

911
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:01,559
that's their view of the world like they

912
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,000
haven't they can't step outside

913
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:06,159
themselves enough and basically see my

914
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,760
point of view that's what I'm saying see

915
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,080
see the world how I see it well I think

916
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,799
it's what you were talking about earlier

917
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,440
just about that certain self-awareness

918
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,720
that you didn't even used to have that

919
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,279
now you have more of and I think most

920
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,720
people don't have it if they would just

921
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,159
have it when they were driving I would

922
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,240
appreciate it especially in the city

923
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:22,760
where there's so many cars if you could

924
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,760
just itch up a little bit further mhm if

925
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,919
you're making a right turn get over to

926
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,480
the right and let me sneak by and maybe

927
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,200
put two wheels on the other side of the

928
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,320
road when it's clear so I can get around

929
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,080
you just do me the solid get all the way

930
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,960
out in the intersection making a left so

931
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,720
that third guy can make it on this light

932
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,919
if you could just [ __ ] do that yeah

933
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,480
but you know they don't do it you know

934
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,440
what I think a lot of it is attributed

935
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,000
to like you ever try to bust balls with

936
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,919
people who aren't in comedy and you're

937
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,600
like oh I think I'm just offending them

938
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,440
you know yeah you got well yeah you

939
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,120
gotta but also where comedies what

940
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,679
comedies where comedians begin MH is

941
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,600
where a lot of uh regular d human beings

942
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,159
stop right but or haven't ventured I

943
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,039
think a lot of the regular decent human

944
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:08,119
beings aren't self-aware like that guy

945
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,560
at the game because he's got nobody

946
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,200
there to say hey buddy you're you're an

947
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,560
[ __ ] and he could be like yeah you

948
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,599
know I don't think that's a comedian

949
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,079
thing I just think that's who he's

950
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,280
surrounded with like there there are

951
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,280
certain people like Eggheads sometimes

952
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,839
get like a ketchup stain like this giant

953
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,159
ketchup stain but they they could

954
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,399
literally stand in Mirror brushing their

955
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,800
teeth and they don't see it because

956
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,040
they're already like I was going to

957
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,359
throw out something that I don't even

958
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,800
understand quantum physics I don't even

959
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:32,159
what that is that just sounds

960
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,280
unbelievably complex to me Chaos Theory

961
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,760
whatever the [ __ ] they're doing they're

962
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,599
doing the math on how long it's going to

963
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,119
take for the next uh some sort of moon

964
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,560
does that sound scientific I don't know

965
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,240
whatever they're they're so cerebral

966
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,399
right that they that so it's not a a uh

967
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,879
it's not even that people don't call

968
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,200
them out on their stuff it's just like

969
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,599
they are they're too smart to take care

970
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,159
of normal [ __ ] basically basically take

971
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,640
care of [ __ ] that's that you and I

972
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,800
consider important

973
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,160
right all right let me get back to our

974
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,720
guy here sorry it's easy to get on

975
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,320
tangents but Adam Smith All right so in

976
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,800
his book The Wealth of Nations Smith

977
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,400
states that in a free market unregulated

978
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,680
capitalism where everybody's trying to

979
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,359
maximize their own gain everybody will

980
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,200
benefit let's start with that you think

981
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:20,320
that's true if everybody tries to

982
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,119
maximize their own everybody's trying to

983
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,480
maximize their own gain and everybody

984
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,280
will benefit before I keep reading on I

985
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,359
like to stop uh yeah I don't see

986
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,839
anything wrong with that I mean I really

987
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,040
think our banking system is is is the

988
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,400
problem you know you know what makes me

989
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,800
this makes me I don't have a solution

990
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,680
though before somebody asked me I don't

991
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,480
have a solution so I don't know if this

992
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,599
is the be if this is the best it gets

993
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,119
then that's the way it is and uh I take

994
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,599
comfort in the fact that I can only die

995
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,320
once my brain goes to the movie you ever

996
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:50,079
see the movie Bruce Almighty that Jim

997
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,280
Carrey movie where he plays God oh he

998
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,960
played God or was it Morgan Freeman well

999
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,920
Morgan Freeman plays God and then lets

1000
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,480
Jim Carrey take over as God for a little

1001
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,400
while I saw the first three quarters on

1002
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,319
a plane and then we landed okay I

1003
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,079
enjoyed it though well at one point at

1004
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,240
one point uh Jim Carrey says everybody

1005
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,200
everybody's praying for everything he

1006
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,640
goes everybody's wishes come true he

1007
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,480
just doesn't want to deal with it he's

1008
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,400
like I'll just make everybody happy and

1009
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,560
when everybody's happy it's chaos you

1010
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,680
know everybody who to win the lottery

1011
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,040
they all win it but they're getting like

1012
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,640
33 cents each like right or the people

1013
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,680
who like you know I would love to kidnap

1014
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,599
someone and use them as a sex slave

1015
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,160
that's my dream like forget that

1016
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,960
monsters out there like that that piece

1017
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,079
of [ __ ] there in Cleveland people think

1018
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,800
that guy took the easy way out like he

1019
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,440
took a hell of a roll of the dice

1020
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,720
there's no way he believed in any sort

1021
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,040
of Afterlife with uh reward and

1022
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,400
Punishment because if I ever did some

1023
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:48,280
[ __ ] like that I would be I would go to

1024
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,720
jail and I would take the ass raping and

1025
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,480
I would try to get on some sort of

1026
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,640
macrobiotic

1027
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,839
diet and try to even with the ass rape

1028
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,079
live as long as I could just because I

1029
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,960
don't want to see this dude if the H if

1030
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,400
the Hell in the Dante is Inferno I mean

1031
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,560
I gotta be like you know well I was

1032
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,240
talking about this with Arty Lang when I

1033
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,079
was on Hitler at that point that this is

1034
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,520
that story broke when I was on art show

1035
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,160
and uh he was saying oh well you know he

1036
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,720
if there's a if there's a hell this guy

1037
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,040
will get it there I said he still gets

1038
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,560
the easy way out though because he could

1039
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,480
have had hell on Earth and then hell in

1040
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,119
hell now he'd only get hell in hell

1041
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,359
that's right but maybe is isn't there

1042
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,480
something where you're sort of paying

1043
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:32,280
for your

1044
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,119
sins by at least I mean there's no way

1045
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,920
to pay for what he

1046
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,480
did look dude I I'm taking the the the

1047
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,119
known hell versus you got to think

1048
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,880
you're talking if you believe in in a

1049
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,599
higher power like it's just like you're

1050
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,319
not going to challenge his hell

1051
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,480
okay what I think even prison what that

1052
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:55,720
is that's like the Coors Light Of

1053
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,880
Hell he's going to come with a single

1054
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,800
malt that you're not even going to be

1055
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,599
able to handle

1056
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,079
yeah so I would be I would really be uh

1057
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:09,000
or maybe I'm just too much of a coward

1058
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,599
to kill myself um it's maybe the maybe

1059
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,040
it's the one good thing that he did in

1060
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,400
life where he didn't he didn't have

1061
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,440
taxpayers maybe have to pay for uh his

1062
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,079
bed but you know it's a horrible thing

1063
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,319
to wish uh you know rape on somebody but

1064
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,880
if anybody [ __ ] deserved it

1065
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:28,720
mhm that you know that dude I don't know

1066
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,160
I would have liked to

1067
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,200
slower you know I think that's more fair

1068
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,520
a slower death because a a quick death

1069
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,119
you know is an easy way out to me it's

1070
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,200
like ah you know especially if there's

1071
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,480
no afterlife how much pain did he have

1072
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,160
he hung himself that's pretty quick

1073
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,319
death right you snap your neck snaps and

1074
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,680
you're out no you can't you can't snap

1075
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:52,839
your neck in a Cell what snaps your neck

1076
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,359
is the fall uhhuh so what you're doing

1077
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,160
there is you're kind of going out like

1078
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,440
that guy in excess he probably was

1079
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,440
jerking off when he did it

1080
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:05,520
had one great orgasm and then just fell

1081
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,680
asleep but like I don't know how how do

1082
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,280
you like hang yourself if you can't tie

1083
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,119
your arms like how do you uh you got to

1084
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,359
will yourself not to do the natural

1085
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,480
Jesus Christ what are we talking about

1086
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:19,839
here this is crazy anyway sorry back to

1087
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,280
Adam back to Adam Smith so so yeah so I

1088
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,720
think if everybody is maximizing their

1089
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,720
own gain I think it's like a Bruce

1090
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,960
Almighty type of situation where

1091
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,400
everybody's rich and nobody's rich

1092
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,240
you know again I don't I don't feel that

1093
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,960
uh I I I think that the the it should

1094
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,480
meet more in a middle the middle I I

1095
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,000
definitely think uh but

1096
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,280
like I don't begrudge your wealth that

1097
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,359
doesn't hurt somebody you know I mean if

1098
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,319
you if you invented YouTube and you're a

1099
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,560
billionaire I mean it's not like you

1100
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:54,359
stood on the heads of poor

1101
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,760
people um unless you have a bunch of

1102
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,440
people in a sweat

1103
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,000
shop writing

1104
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,400
code um which is probably the case

1105
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,720
anytime you see a bunch of coders

1106
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,240
they're always in some it's why I think

1107
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,480
when they go to put out the YouTube

1108
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,880
t-shirts and hoodies for Christmas

1109
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,040
that's probably going to be done in El

1110
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,400
Salvador Honduras even the program you

1111
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,800
ever see a programmer they look like

1112
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,040
they're in sweat shops they're just in

1113
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:23,319
some dark like uh Dungey type of place

1114
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,079
typing true anyway uh he says uh this is

1115
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:26,760
because the competition between sellers

1116
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,440
makes for better products and lower

1117
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,200
costs he calls this the Invisible Hand

1118
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,560
he says that all will benefit even if

1119
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,480
the intentions of those involved are not

1120
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,359
good so he's saying it doesn't even

1121
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,680
matter if you have bad intentions yeah

1122
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,440
this sounds like this was written by a

1123
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,960
rich guy Adam Smith uh oh this is the

1124
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,839
philosopher yeah this is this is the

1125
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,560
philosopher well look it's not like you

1126
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,440
know when people go you know communism

1127
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,520
socialism capitalism I don't really

1128
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,800
know what any of those are I just know

1129
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,359
that people uh they do what's good for

1130
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,520
them and uh I don't think it matters

1131
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,760
what kind of government you have it's

1132
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,119
like they're

1133
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,160
all flawed because we we are it's all

1134
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,760
the same [ __ ] yeah it's it's I you know

1135
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,720
when I go to Finland they try to say

1136
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,319
that there's no rich people there they

1137
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,440
have this thing and they don't it's

1138
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:18,839
reverse Kanye West in that you don't sit

1139
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,359
there and talk about all the [ __ ] you

1140
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,839
have that's considered really tacky and

1141
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:24,760
then you're also considered nobody's

1142
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:27,280
Rich they pay an insane level of taxes

1143
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,760
but everything's paid for mhm you know

1144
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,680
you need a [ __ ] heart transplant

1145
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,800
they're like all right come on in no

1146
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,880
worries lay on the table but then the

1147
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,680
the part about that though is the

1148
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,880
downside to that is you know there's

1149
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,680
definitely the upside but then the

1150
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,280
downside is they they said that some

1151
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,680
people can just become these lifelong

1152
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,520
students and kind of not get on with

1153
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,640
their lives but I immediately asked when

1154
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,760
they said you know we don't have any

1155
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,200
rich people here it's like well do you

1156
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,480
have Banks here they're like yeah I'm

1157
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,079
like well then do you have some rich

1158
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,839
people here yeah they're just good about

1159
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,839
I think it's I think it's a different in

1160
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,800
mentality between going back to my

1161
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,960
Country Club Theory I think the people

1162
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,920
who run the country club either have one

1163
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,319
of two different this is back to my yeah

1164
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,280
they have one one of two different

1165
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,240
strategies when it comes to the to the

1166
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,880
People Like Us that that they need to

1167
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,800
keep it going the taxpayers it's either

1168
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,960
keep them living a long time or make

1169
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,680
sure they die quick yeah it's a it's a

1170
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Ponzi scheme but like I but it works it

1171
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,200
you know it doesn't and it it it I think

1172
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,520
it it's working the best it's going

1173
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,800
going to work and

1174
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:37,520
um I don't have any solutions for like

1175
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,520
how to make it work better I I wish that

1176
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,480
uh that um we made more stuff here in

1177
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,920
this country I wish that you know the

1178
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,240
unions didn't drive didn't become what

1179
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,400
they were fighting in some ways I wish

1180
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,680
that the the the owners of the companies

1181
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,800
could have figured out a way to meet in

1182
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,000
the middle and uh and then I don't think

1183
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,400
that we would I don't think we would

1184
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
have nearly the reputation we have

1185
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,920
around the world it's just and we kind

1186
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,800
of let all our Aces go then we had to go

1187
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,319
out and take everybody else's stuff it's

1188
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,520
it's the the thing that scares me is not

1189
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,559
that that there's people powerful people

1190
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,680
it's that it just seems like there's a

1191
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,720
certain level of just like it there's

1192
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,760
never enough like when are you going to

1193
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,839
be making enough interest when are you

1194
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,839
going to have enough land when are you

1195
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:25,000
going to have enough control and it just

1196
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,680
seems like it's a

1197
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,920
uh insatiable

1198
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,720
sure because there's always somebody

1199
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,720
else who who wants to have more land so

1200
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,599
it's always it's never going to I don't

1201
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,319
think it'll ever end I well I think when

1202
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:40,839
you're when you're trying

1203
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,680
to amass stuff in control it's like

1204
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:44,680
empty calories it's just like you know

1205
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,319
when you eat shitty food you're hungry

1206
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,000
like eat Chinese food you get hungry

1207
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,640
well our version of Chinese food when

1208
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,280
you eat it you you you get hungry really

1209
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,680
quickly it's because there's so little

1210
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,119
nutrition in it but your body is still

1211
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:00,280
craving nutrition and you you basically

1212
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,960
filled up the void the hunger Pang but

1213
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,240
like the reason why you get hungry

1214
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,040
instantly after [ __ ] food is because

1215
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,359
there's just's so little nutrition in it

1216
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,920
so that's your body is still going I

1217
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:11,319
need this vitamin I need this I need

1218
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,640
this and it's I'm I'm still not getting

1219
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:14,359
it so I think that's everything it's not

1220
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,000
even just food it's all the stuff too

1221
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:17,720
like people buying lots of stuff to make

1222
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,640
them feel better but there's still that

1223
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,800
emptiness it exists in everywhere yeah

1224
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,280
so I don't think that that like that's

1225
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,040
the frightening thing about it um I'm

1226
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,839
really in way over my head this is way

1227
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,040
deeper than

1228
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,720
you know and everybody out there all all

1229
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,280
of my philosophies two or three

1230
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,000
follow-up questions they all come

1231
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,040
crumbling to

1232
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,200
Earth how how has your relationship to

1233
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,400
money changed since you're now making

1234
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:49,079
money um I try

1235
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:53,880
to I try to remain debt free so um

1236
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:56,720
there's no 401K for a comedian so I try

1237
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,960
and I I'm not into the stock market I'm

1238
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,440
not into to Banks mhm I mean I play the

1239
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,480
game sort of required to put a certain

1240
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,920
amount into the 401K and then I just put

1241
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,119
it on the crap table right um but my

1242
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,200
philosophy when when I was investing was

1243
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,720
like all right I want to invest in

1244
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,480
companies that are getting tangible

1245
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,520
stuff like that whole pets.com crap like

1246
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,520
I never Bond into that but if like you

1247
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,880
were like if you had a gold mine and you

1248
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,040
were digging for gold or you you know

1249
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,760
you you some sort of Agriculture it just

1250
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,400
seemed like it was a you could you know

1251
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,960
whatever it was something real it wasn't

1252
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,280
in the air or philosophy but then after

1253
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,800
a while I just was kind of going all

1254
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,160
right so I'm investing in this we'll

1255
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,440
just say the gold you know uh the minor

1256
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,599
thing right company I'm like at the end

1257
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,359
of it I don't get any gold so this is

1258
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,880
stupid so then I was wanted to have

1259
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:51,920
something tangible so like to me it was

1260
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,960
obvious it's like buy a house so I

1261
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,559
bought a house and then I'm just I've

1262
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,599
just paid it down like an absolute

1263
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,119
Madman

1264
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,400
and

1265
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:08,040
um you know it's very sparsely

1266
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:11,480
furnished um and but like the freedom I

1267
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,079
have of you know not having credit card

1268
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,000
debt because I've lived like that and

1269
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,760
had it hanging over my head and it used

1270
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,680
to wake me up at night and it was awful

1271
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,280
and people would call and where's our

1272
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,040
money and all that and I I hated it and

1273
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,960
something my brother told me a long time

1274
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,920
ago he goes you know what we were

1275
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,319
working at the same place we look

1276
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,839
looking out over this sea of cubicles

1277
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,240
and he was just breaking it down like

1278
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:33,599
all these guys like would working in the

1279
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,079
warehouse and then then they would get a

1280
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,760
position I want a position and then they

1281
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,480
would move out to the carpeted cubicle

1282
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,640
area and theyd buy their little you know

1283
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,480
shirt and tie and my brother would be

1284
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,760
like what's the first thing that they do

1285
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,599
and I was like you know what and he goes

1286
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,319
they go out and they buy a new car and

1287
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:51,480
it's like now you just change yourself

1288
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,000
to your desk you can't you can't leave

1289
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,760
and then he goes and then also the

1290
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,200
average [ __ ] gets a dollar an hour

1291
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,640
raise and they immediately start

1292
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,640
spending $2 more an hour so they're just

1293
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,079
constantly chasing it and you're just

1294
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,680
behind the eightball I mean you're just

1295
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:07,440
completely [ __ ] you know if nobody

1296
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,599
teaches you those things or tells you

1297
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,280
those things it's like through student

1298
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,280
loans and a couple of credit cards and

1299
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,880
getting yourself some Transportation you

1300
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,440
like these kids today are so far behind

1301
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,720
the eight ball like like the amount of

1302
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,119
money that they they charge for college

1303
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,000
to go into this job market with no

1304
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,599
guarantee of any sort of a job it's a

1305
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,640
[ __ ] ripoff like had a kid I'd be

1306
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,960
like look this is the way to do it go

1307
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,680
two years to a junior college you know

1308
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,920
pay a you know a couple thousand for the

1309
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,000
year rather than 30 40 50 or whatever

1310
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,240
and then

1311
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,040
transfer to the place that you want to

1312
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,640
have on your diploma and only pay two

1313
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,920
years you get it for half cost right

1314
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,319
there and you're you're better off to

1315
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,200
like I think you're just even better off

1316
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,520
just going to vocational school you know

1317
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,520
you're better off meeting a bunch of

1318
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,599
smart motivated people your age that

1319
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,160
share a vision and you guys try to start

1320
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,319
something yeah you're you're you're

1321
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,280
better off doing that than going two

1322
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:05,240
years of a language major in this you

1323
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,559
know being in intern here um not totally

1324
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,280
[ __ ] on I'm not trying to depress

1325
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,599
anybody that's that's on that track but

1326
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,440
like I have empathy for that but anyway

1327
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:14,880
so I did that and I resent it I think it

1328
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,680
was it was just a terrible waste of my

1329
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,839
money it was right my brother also told

1330
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,960
me a great thing because he's always

1331
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,200
been great with money and he said you

1332
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,920
know what true wealth is it said is

1333
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,359
going into a mall being able to buy

1334
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,599
anything and then you don't

1335
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:33,920
and you just walk out and like those are

1336
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:37,000
the like the lessons that you know stuck

1337
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,040
with me it's why I drive a Prius I mean

1338
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,359
part of it the reason why I did the

1339
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,079
Prius is because I fly every other

1340
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,599
weekend I've literally put my own hole

1341
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,760
in the ozone layer so I had to do

1342
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,359
something and I saw enough people in

1343
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,000
these flashy cars you know you got a car

1344
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,200
that can go 180 M an hour and you're in

1345
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,559
bumper-to-bumper traffic with me so um I

1346
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,920
would

1347
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,240
rather you know I have one TV people

1348
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,559
always give me [ __ ] it's not big enough

1349
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,240
for my living room cuz it's the one that

1350
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:02,799
I had when I had a one bedroom apartment

1351
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,160
but it's it's paid for and it it [ __ ]

1352
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:05,559
works what am I supposed to do throw it

1353
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,640
out

1354
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:12,440
so like those are those are the things

1355
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,280
like you know but because I've done that

1356
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,240
like today I don't have to work I can go

1357
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,160
play drums and go see a movie yeah and

1358
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,079
if you're if you're young and you're

1359
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,400
listening to this I implore you to go

1360
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,920
down that road because if you could tell

1361
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,319
from the last hour I am not the

1362
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,359
brightest guy

1363
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:31,680
I am not a well- read guy I went after a

1364
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:35,640
passion but you you can have that life

1365
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,480
like dude having a life like living as

1366
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,520
debt free as you can being able to go to

1367
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,200
the movies whenever you want to is about

1368
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,839
as free as it gets unless you get to

1369
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,680
that Eyes Wide Shut level where you're

1370
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:51,000
going to the Cloak and Dagger move you

1371
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,960
know like it's really it's as close to a

1372
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,839
[ __ ]

1373
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,480
Utopia as you can get to right yeah so

1374
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:58,920
then I do all this geeky [ __ ] like learn

1375
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,119
how to make pasta from scratch learn how

1376
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,520
to cook learn you know drums I play

1377
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,359
hockey it's a [ __ ] my life is a [ __ ]

1378
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,440
joke like I just feel like if there is a

1379
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,440
higher power they're looking down either

1380
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,079
laughing or just shaking their head like

1381
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,760
what a this kid isn't doing anything I

1382
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,520
think I think the ultimate goal of every

1383
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,119
adult is how do you get back to being a

1384
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,920
kid you know which is like you know

1385
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,440
playing drums and seeing movies and

1386
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,000
don't listen I remember when when I when

1387
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,400
I was first I was just going to get into

1388
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,640
radio and I remember I went to the meat

1389
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,599
store went to the butcher with my mom

1390
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,839
and uh she mentioned you know he's like

1391
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:32,040
he's like so what is your son doing you

1392
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:34,440
know blah blah doing that whole thing

1393
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,799
and I was just was mentioning that you

1394
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,079
know I was Major in communication I

1395
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,920
wanted to get in radio and the guy was

1396
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,520
like you know I don't know I remember he

1397
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,920
turned around he's like everybody wants

1398
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:47,760
to be the star like walking away and I'm

1399
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:51,880
just looking at this guy with his bloody

1400
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,240
apron talking to me like he had the keys

1401
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,839
to true happiness now he might he might

1402
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,720
have I mean that was owned by their

1403
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,160
brothers and they work side by side they

1404
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,640
saw each other and they cut up pork

1405
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,880
chops all day maybe they that was their

1406
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,359
maybe that was their dream but like I

1407
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,440
don't think that he found his dream in

1408
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:11,520
life because he was [ __ ] on mine and

1409
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,160
I don't think a truly happy person does

1410
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,400
that or he could have been truly happy

1411
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,920
and was so drunk with his happiness he

1412
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,480
couldn't figure out why I didn't want to

1413
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,200
jump over the counter I think he was

1414
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,880
just put on a bloody apron and cut up ve

1415
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,520
with him yeah I think he's probably just

1416
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,079
jealous in other words like if that

1417
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,079
works out for you and if doesn't work

1418
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:31,359

1426
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,280
need to cut out of your life yeah like

1427
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,079
the beginning of a cancer where you

1428
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,880
catch it in time you got to catch it in

1429
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,040
time or those [ __ ] people I swear to

1430
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,520
God if they're in your ear they could

1431
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,319
literally like I have a I have a

1432
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,400
philosophy that the the the next Jimmy

1433
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:02,480
Hendricks you know hasn't come because

1434
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,240
maybe he's surrounded by the wrong

1435
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,240
people and is driving a forklift at Home

1436
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,520
Depot it's probably true yeah you know

1437
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,319
yeah they're don't it's stupid it's a

1438
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:15,200
dumb dream keep keep your mind on down

1439
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:16,920
and get real job um all right so we

1440
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,880
usually uh wrap the show up with these

1441
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,240
quotes and I ask the guest to read them

1442
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,359
we go through them and that's how I end

1443
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,240
it beautiful all right so I read the

1444
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:28,760
first quote here right yeah wherever

1445
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,760
there is great property there is great

1446
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,960
inequality um I think it depends on your

1447
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:37,000
definition of inequality I think back in

1448
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,960
the 1700s where you couldn't start a

1449
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,720
YouTube channel yeah and you couldn't be

1450
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,119
a bunch of college kids doing bong hits

1451
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,200
yeah watching TV not like that's the the

1452
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,720
road to success but you're still kind of

1453
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,640
like I don't think that they had Rich

1454
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,119
the same kinds of rich people that they

1455
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,119
do nowadays where you could have like

1456
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,839
these fun sort of people like the Mark

1457
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,799
Cubans you know and uh the people who

1458
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,160
just you know although that dude who

1459
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:03,839
starts started the Facebook I'm judging

1460
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,000
him by the movie he sounded he seemed

1461
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:09,079
pretty miserable so I I think I think um

1462
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,400
blue blood blue blood wealth caused a

1463
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:13,160
lot of misery yeah so this is no long

1464
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:17,240
I'm basing that off a couple things I

1465
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:19,680
read and uh There Will Be Blood movie

1466
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,319
so this is just basically talking about

1467
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,880
physical property and now you're saying

1468
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:25,079
there's other kinds of property

1469
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,640
intellectual property tell you when I

1470
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:30,040
watched those meum autumn Auto shows

1471
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,720
where they auction off like up for bids

1472
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,599
you know this rare Ferrari or this

1473
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,520
Shelby Mustang and like these people

1474
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,799
just spend a million dollars on a car

1475
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:41,799
add of their collection I it does like

1476
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:44,280
why isn't that guy immediately being

1477
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:45,559
audited right like how much you know how

1478
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,599
much money you have to have that your

1479
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:50,440
wife isn't going to [ __ ] that you just

1480
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,079
dropped you know a million dollars dude

1481
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,920
that there's one Ferrari that in from

1482
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,480
the early 60s that's like the one that

1483
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,760
everybody wants I mean it's selling for

1484
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,839
like 12 million 13 million it's

1485
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,920
basically it's getting up there to like

1486
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:05,640
Derek Jeter's salary for the year you

1487
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,559
know is the same it's insane it's insane

1488
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,960
so um I definitely look but you know

1489
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,520
just coming from more of an artistic way

1490
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,079
I'm living my life you know the way they

1491
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,920
look at us like we're bums who don't

1492
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:18,640
work which is a lot of Truth to that I

1493
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,559
look at them like you know you know how

1494
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,119
many heads did you step on to get where

1495
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,599
you're at so I I I still think there's

1496
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,520
some truth in that but I I I don't think

1497
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,880
it's straight across the board sorry

1498
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,440
Adam all right let's move on to the you

1499
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,799
got the next one there people okay

1500
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:37,160
people of the same trade seldom meet

1501
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:40,280
together even for mert and diversion but

1502
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:42,920
the conversation ends in in a conspiracy

1503
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,040
against the public or in some

1504
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,599
contrivance to raise prices I got to

1505
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,240
read that like 12 times I think he's

1506
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:51,160
saying that people in the same trade

1507
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,760
seldom meet together to have a good time

1508
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,440
and just take their mind off work but

1509
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,319
they actually have a

1510
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:59,720
conversation that ends in conspir iracy

1511
00:54:57,319 --> 00:55:01,960
against the public or in some

1512
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,920
contrivance to raise prices like when

1513
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,559
people like two people get together

1514
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,200
going you know how's business how's it

1515
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,280
going he you know you know what we could

1516
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,920
do hey dude if I say pork chops are this

1517
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,240
and you say they're that we can make

1518
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,920
this I think that that's what he's

1519
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,960
saying um well we did wind up sitting

1520
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,559
together and talking conspiracy so that

1521
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,440
part was true right but we didn't

1522
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,960
conspire against anybody well this is

1523
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,160
once again these are a little dated I

1524
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,559
don't think back then yeah that she got

1525
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,880
away from the wife and then they brought

1526
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:29,280
in some hookers and stuff yeah yeah I

1527
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,359
think he's talking about like you know

1528
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,760
the Rothchild type of people they'll get

1529
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,319
together and they'll conspire you and I

1530
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,640
are just going to I just don't think

1531
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,400
there was as many fun trades back then

1532
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,039
yeah you know what I mean I mean you

1533
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,559
couldn't like go on the road get on a

1534
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,160
horse and go do some comedy shows so I

1535
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,359
think I think Adam is a great

1536
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,680
philosopher but he's uh his stuff is a

1537
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:53,839
has Isn't standing the test of time okay

1538
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,599
um we got one more here it is not from

1539
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,960
the benevolence I actually looked up

1540
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,200
that word the the day benevolence it

1541
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,920
just means that you're doing something

1542
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,000
for an overall good yeah common good I

1543
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,359
think I already forget it's not from the

1544
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,400
benevolence of the butcher the Brewer or

1545
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:11,720
the baker that we expect our dinner but

1546
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,119
from their regard to their own

1547
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:17,160
self-interest we address ourselves not

1548
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:20,240
to their Humanity but to their self-love

1549
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:22,880
and never talk to them of our own

1550
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,119
Necessities but of their advantages

1551
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,359
Jesus Christ never slow it down here all

1552
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:29,559
right right it is not from the

1553
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,599
benevolence of the butcher the Brewer or

1554
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:32,880
the baker that we expect our dinner so

1555
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,680
in other words these guys aren't doing

1556
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,920
it to be nice to us they're doing it cuz

1557
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,799
they're making money right I think but

1558
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,319
from the guard of their own

1559
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:40,960
self-interest which is basically they're

1560
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:43,799
trying to make money off of being this

1561
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,079
mhm we address ourselves not to their

1562
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:47,760
Humanity but to their

1563
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,039
self-love well what does that mean they

1564
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,880
don't want to die so they have to make

1565
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:54,440
money being a baker right and never talk

1566
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,720
to them of our own Necessities you know

1567
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,680
my dad would never listen to me

1568
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,000
can I get some rye I guess they're

1569
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,400
saying you never go talk to that butcher

1570
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,280
the guy who was telling you forget about

1571
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,680
being a radio guy you wouldn't even be

1572
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,920
there if you didn't need meat and he

1573
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,839
wouldn't even be there if he didn't need

1574
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,520
money or does that mean and never talk

1575
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,280
to them of our own Necessities but of

1576
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,799
their advantages were like maybe I

1577
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,960
wanted this kind of meat MH or I needed

1578
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,880
it at this price but he sets the prices

1579
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:25,240
I I guess this guy wanted a a deeper

1580
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,440
relationship during those little moments

1581
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,880
of uh all right who who's next yeah can

1582
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,440
I get a pound of

1583
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,480
hamburger and he just turns his back see

1584
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,160
that's all he cares about all he cares

1585
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,920
about them this guy's like this guy I

1586
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,680
swear to God I really hope this isn't

1587
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,880
true but I could see a really beautiful

1588
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,920
funloving woman walking into his life uh

1589
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,200
him ruining it for a good well they

1590
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,680
didn't have three-year relationships

1591
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,839
back then for a good couple of weeks and

1592
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,000
then her just hopefully having the sense

1593
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,119
to pick up her giant dresses and walk

1594
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,839
the [ __ ] out of this guy's life

1595
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,400
bit of miserable bastard yeah so I think

1596
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:04,200
that this guy is uh I can relate to him

1597
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,640
oh man uh well if you want to read more

1598
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,880
of his stuff he also published the

1599
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,160
theory of moral sentiments and uh I

1600
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,400
actually really enjoyed all of those

1601
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,400
quotes it was really deep and it was

1602
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,559
beyond me yeah beyond beyond my

1603
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,240
intelligence that's what I like about

1604
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,119
this stuff it's like I just try and

1605
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,960
figure something out that I didn't have

1606
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,200
before and sometimes well this what I

1607
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,720
like about this guy is this guy isn't

1608
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,359
just walking down the street he's kind

1609
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,039
of like you know looking at just the

1610
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,039
white why people are talking and this

1611
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:33,799
and this sort of uh thought it can

1612
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:36,559
really lead to some massive growth as a

1613
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:38,520
person and massive depression I think

1614
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,880
that last quote by the way just you know

1615
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,240
my mom is I don't know if you know my

1616
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,520
mom is Scottish but oh she that last

1617
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,880
quote just sounded very Scottish just I

1618
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,680
just I remember talking to you about

1619
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,319
that when we were in Scotland you saying

1620
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,880
like you loved it out here and I just

1621
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:52,559
remember that well now that you brought

1622
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,400
it up now I remember that's just a very

1623
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,640
like just Scottish people especially

1624
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,599
Glasgow people just go around

1625
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,480
complaining did you see that did you see

1626
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,880
that he didn't spend he doesn't care

1627
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:05,039
about me all he cares about himself all

1628
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,160
he cares about his stupid meat business

1629
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,000
