PS Jesse insisted on sponsoring an

30
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,439
episode I would have gladly plugged his

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
podcast for free but he's trying to help

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,000
me out and he's a just a good dude

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
that's the kind of guy Jesse PS is and

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,960
he really really does deserve you to go

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,640
check out what he's doing because he's a

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,119
mad comedy genius who just I I think

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,360
this is all he does I think all he does

38
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,439
is the podcast and he's just cooped up

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,079
in his apartment in New York and I think

40
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,759
he's attached to a urine bag cuz he

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,880
broke his penis or something at some

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,200
point and I think just everything

43
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,799
everything kind of goes wrong for him

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
but he just turns it into hilarious

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,399
comedy which is some of the best comedy

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,240
is the stuff that comes out of tragedy

47
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,280
so check out Jesse PS he's a very very

48
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,399

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,320
guy um now on a on a different note

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,520

and I recorded this interview in his

88

hotel room in Las Vegas before he was

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,599
doing shows he's been a wonderful guy to

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,680
me for years he continues to be and and

91
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,239
I really had a thrill doing it we

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,280
recorded a few weeks ago so if you hear

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,959

97
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,560
explain that to you but I thought I I

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,360
thought I'd do it anyway just to be

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,519
nice just to put it in some

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,560

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,560
response from you yeah well it's

122
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,600
sarcastic but still yes it's very

123
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,360
sarcasm yeah still didn't expect it leis

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,280
the philosopher that Alex picked out for

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,520
us to go through today is someone named

126
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,680
William James have you ever heard of him

127
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,160
wow yeah I have but I don't remember do

128
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,600
thing about him you're you're somebody

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,160
who's pretty I I think is pretty

130
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,120
academic right you've well no I went to

131
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,960
school I doesn't make me like you

132
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
absorbed it no I did well I I know who

133
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,039
William James is I don't remember what

134
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,000
anything about William James I kind of

135
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,440
know you know I studied I I took one

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,560
course in philosophy in college you know

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,759
the fact that you were once a playwright

138
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,720
to me puts you like on a whole another

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,720
intellectual playing field than me just

140
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,000
just the word playright it just meant I

141
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,960
didn't want to make any money that was

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
the reason I was a playright I was but

143
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,360
it's it's I wanted to see what it was

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,120
like to live at the bottom line of uh of

145
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,880
income still be doing something right

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,319
it's like a cultural Pursuit though like

147
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,080
nobody there's no like pop I guess maybe

148
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,600
there are pop playwrights but it's just

149
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,280
not something no not a lot of people do

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,560
it I mean there a bunch of people who do

151
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,720
it now I mean and then go on and write

152
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,599
for film and television mainly all right

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,240
so I'm I'm making assumptions about you

154
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,880
that might not be correct the reason why

155
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,520
Alex picked him he said that he read

156
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,080
somewhere and and I'll verify this with

157
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,880
you now that you believe in psychics to

158
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,319
some extent is that to some extent I

159
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,680
mean I believe in there's one psychic I

160
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
know that uh I think is pretty

161
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,520
extraordinary but I wouldn't say I'm

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,160
like a a boy all psychics you know the

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,479
woman on the Long Island site K I don't

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,520
think I'm buying uh the guy the other

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,720
guy who had the show every day at the

166
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,000
same time as dror Phil I don't think I

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,280

184
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,120
uh he um he's going to be doing really

185
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,360
well and things are going to go great

186
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,319
for him and he went on and on and on uh

187
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,319
without ever meeting me so I went to

188
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,879
meet him and then he uh knew nothing

189
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:44,159
about me there's no way to know that my

190
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:47,280
brother was sick and uh and uh at that

191
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,039
point in time and he knew it and he knew

192
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,000
a whole bunch of other things that he

193
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,759
you couldn't have researched you just

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,440
couldn't have researched and then it you

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,039
know and then even from that it was uh I

196
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,560
would be at a point where something uh

197
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,159
you know either was doing excessive

198
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,639
amount of work or something crazy was

199
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,440
going on and he would call

200
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,800
up

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,680
um and say uh you know and basically

202
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,960
describe the situation I was in what

203
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,360
what do you think you can attribute it

204
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,800
to some he says that he talks to dead

205
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,759
people so and it but it's that's the way

206
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:30,120
he puts it simply and uh uh he's um uh

207
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,440
written a book about it and uh I even I

208
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,440
wrote the intro to the book because I

209
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,560
think I mean it's he uh I think it's

210
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,719
called growing up psychic and um he

211
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,959
attributes it to

212
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,959
um I don't I I mean I don't know what he

213
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:50,360
I mean I don't know what to attribute it

214
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:52,399
to but there apparently is uh there's

215
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,519
something out there does this

216
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,720
information change your perspective on

217
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,680
life when you found out that someone

218
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,040
possibly could talk to the dead did you

219
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,839
make you reeval valuate yeah a little it

220
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,560
certainly did where were you before that

221
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,120
and where are you now well I mean I

222
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,600
always thought anything was possible I

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,160
think it's kind of ludicrous to sit

224
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,920
around and go you know that's a bunch of

225
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,240
nonsense when you know when look if you

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,720
you look at a rose really and that where

227
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,959
do you [ __ ] think that came from mhm

228
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,640
I mean I wasn't like uh I I didn't have

229
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:28,600
a lot of uh religious belief um or I had

230
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,040
but I certainly had a slight inkling

231
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
toward something that was bigger going

232
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,320
on because

233
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,519
it's it's really you know either that or

234
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,200
a petri dish you know and uh and you

235
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:47,720
know and things just growing in the dish

236
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:51,880
and uh so it it kind of uh open my eyes

237
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,839
to to certain possibilities and

238
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,320
um and I I experienced the death of my

239
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,399
brother was pretty uh I mean my brother

240
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,480
died and I felt him in the room I'm not

241
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,120
one of those people who does that mhm I

242
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,160
you know I came in and I was trying to

243
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,920
save him and then I realized that I'm

244
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,079
not save him I was told that I had to

245
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,240
give him a mouth-to-mouth

246
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:19,160
resuscitation uh and uh they his wife

247
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,040
hadn't done it and I came in and there

248
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,200
was no way he was going to do anything

249
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,240
but it was weird because a I knew that

250
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,120
if I had that weird moment I knew if I

251
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,800
brought him back he he'd been very sick

252
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,440
if I brought him back he'd be pissed

253
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,880
because it would be like really we're

254
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,839
going to we're going to have to do this

255
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,639
again yeah um and the other thing was is

256
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,200
but then uh but when I entered the room

257
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,000
I mean when I was doing this and

258
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,200
afterward I felt that he was there now

259
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,839
you know you can say it's conjured and

260
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,079
da D but I felt his presence for a while

261
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,880
and weird things happened afterwards and

262
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:58,360
and it's not uh to me a a Confluence of

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,880
events it was uh doors that hadn't been

264
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,399
opened open

265
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,480
and there was no reason that they hadn't

266
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,200
been open two [ __ ] years before that

267
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,839
M or four years before that stuff just

268
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,360
started to happen and it was a little

269
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,040
strange I've never had an experience

270
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,440
where I felt the presence and i' I'm

271
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,760
kind of like one of these guys I want it

272
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,160
you know like I'm like come on I want uh

273
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,200
I want that kind of thing to happen but

274
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,200
can you can you describe it for me like

275
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,800
what it would be like or what it was

276
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,639
like for you you mean having feeling the

277
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,519
presence feeling his presence I mean

278
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,399
it's just like a weird sense of him it's

279
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,440
uh it was just the sense of him it's as

280
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,639
if he were there it's it's like if if if

281
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,079
you're sitting in a room with six people

282
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,839
mhm uh and you know everybody that's

283
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,160
there and you're talking to one of the

284
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,680
people in the room but you're still

285
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,560
conscious of the others uh it was like

286
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,360
being conscious of his presence just

287
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,160
that he would not that I could turn to

288
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,959
him and talk to himh and not that I had

289
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,600
the experience of him ever saying you

290
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,680
know this but uh uh or that or the other

291
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,399
but my you know I had the sense of him

292
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,560
being in the room and I didn't and I I

293
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,399

leis okay whatever we're doing I mean

378
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,800
not that I was anywhere at the time but

379
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,199
it was always like wow we are really

380
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,240
here it's like the uh you know we're

381
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,720
just sitting here at the very end of the

382
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,120
line you it was it was fun though it was

383
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,759
fun to watch it was it was really wacky

384
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,639
God yeah he's an interesting piece of

385
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,040
Show Business yeah he really is

386
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,839
all right so let's find out about our

387
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,720
guy here William James uh William James

388
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,279
asserted that he had free will because

389
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,920
he had the ability to believe in

390
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,199
it secondly he said that determinists

391
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,040
those who believe the future is

392
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,560
determined completely by uh causality of

393
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,440
the past are wrong because they look at

394
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,600
everything in hindsight James uses his

395
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,240
definity Avenue and Oxford Street

396
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,920
example a two- Choice decision-making

397
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,040
process one being presented with chance

398
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,639
to making decisions based on that chance

399
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,839
thus showing how your free will gives

400
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,279
consent to make the chance into reality

401
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,399
I guess he's just I think what he's

402
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,240
saying is Well basically I mean

403
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,920
something you know you got you know it's

404
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,600
that thing you look at a store window do

405
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,399
you want to go in and I'm just saying it

406
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,759
because of Oxford Street but you look at

407
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,360
a store window and there's a a shirt in

408
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,079
there you might want to buy so you make

409
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,319
or you could continue walking down to

410
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,399
have lunch MH so you going to have the

411
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:32,519
lunch you going you know so that by

412
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,040
chance you see this thing or whatever

413
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,519
this and you go oh I'm going to go in

414
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,759
there MH uh hence you you know it's you

415
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,160
know do you have the you you've made the

416
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,759
Free Will choice to go in there thereby

417
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,360
thereby You' have you know since you've

418
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,639
made that choice you have free will well

419
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,759
I mean that all works well and good

420
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,319
unless it's you know unless it's all

421
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,240
predetermined right and and the and the

422
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,079
shirt was you know you were supposed to

423
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,520
go get the shirt because that's the and

424
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:06,439
I I kind of you know I you know I just

425
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,640
think if the problem with the you know I

426
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,039
mean they the thing with philosophers

427
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,160
which is really you know which is why I

428
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,039
couldn't do it is this this this you

429
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,520
know the basically the argument is if we

430
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,799
do a and if if a is true what about b b

431
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,720
is true what about c c and then then you

432
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,919
get somebody arguing well you know a may

433
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
not be true because right you know and

434
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,559
so therefore your be is a piece of [ __ ]

435
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,960
and they fight over this stuff all the

436
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:35,720
time to me it's mainly a matter of uh

437
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,799
you know if it's determined then then

438
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,840
then what [ __ ] fun is this right you

439
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,080
know if it's the you know it's um I

440
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,720
don't know uh so I mean to me it's just

441
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,880
a matter of if I want to really en enjoy

442
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,280
it a little

443
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,640
more then I have to believe I'm choosing

444
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,400
something that I'm actually involved in

445
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
it right you know well I think he's

446
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,159
talking a little bit about Randomness in

447
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,159
the UN Universe mixed with you know yeah

448
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:08,480
uh things that are predetermined right

449
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,480
so you get a 50/50 there it's like it's

450
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,799
half fun and it's and it's half out of

451
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,679
your hands yeah it's half out of your

452
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,520
hands well because there's some you know

453
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,799
who knows do you ever look at an

454
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,679
audience before you go on stage and you

455
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,799
you already know this is going to be a

456
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,720
good audience this is going to be a

457
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,679
shitty audience um no because I learned

458
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,880
a long time ago you can't you can't fig

459
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,600
I mean if you looked at my audiences now

460
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,000
a lot of places I go to you'd say really

461
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,240
these guys are going to laugh I mean

462
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,720
there's the mix is crazy I mean it goes

463
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,520
from people wearing suits to people

464
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,480
wearing overalls to people wearing you

465
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,640
know uh you know people who have um you

466
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,080
know uh piercings everywhere to people

467
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,120
who are uh you know to 14y olds so I

468
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,840
don't determine it anymore you know I

469
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,400
mean it's only I the only time I think

470
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,600
it gets when you have a mix you're fine

471
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,799
it's at least is far as I've always been

472
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,559
concerned if you've got one group of

473
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,000
people let's say all Jews all Catholics

474
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,760
all all people who work for Quaker roach

475
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,960
you're you're semi

476
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,400
[ __ ] why is that why do you think well

477
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,919
because because I agree with that but I

478
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,120
don't know why that is well corporate

479
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,919
stuff it's always because they're

480
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,400
looking around and the same thing if you

481
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,760
get a whole bunch of Jews in the room

482
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,919
you know or a whole bunch of Catholics

483
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,799
or whatever that they're it's

484
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,640
homogeneous so there's no bounce to the

485
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,919
room I think you're better off with a

486
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,280
whole bunch of Catholics if you're a

487
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,840
Jewish performer yes you know because if

488
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,559
you're if you're a Jew I think there's

489
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,200
always an attitude of like ah we're all

490
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,960
the same I could be doing this right

491
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,720
yeah exactly but except I did do one

492
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,640
Temple once and uh sorry it worked I did

493
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,400
a temple once and it worked it went

494
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,520
pretty well and I was surprised it did I

495
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
that's why I never want to get like into

496
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,159
the Jewish scene of the the Jewish

497
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
comedy scene like there's gigs there for

498
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,720
me and I could make money and it I'd be

499
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,919
better off but then there's like this

500
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,799
part of me that's like I think that's

501
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,640
part of one of the one of the waiting

502
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,919
rooms to hell is playing synagogues well

503
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,520
you just do a few remember do one or two

504
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,960
to just keep the the cash flow going

505
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,360
yeah yeah I think the other Wai need to

506
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,720
make it a way of life but you can

507
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,320
certainly use it as a you know an option

508
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,039
I've avoided it this long and now I

509
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,280
think it's time to cave in and start

510
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,600
doing

511
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,440
a but uh yeah I think that's uh you know

512
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,280
also I've I've talked about this on one

513
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,280
of the other shows when I'd go up for

514
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,919
auditions like a standup audition is a

515
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,200
weird thing when cuz you're at you're

516
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,880
asking for a Randomness to work in a way

517
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,880
you know I I'm I have a pretty good

518
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,600
record when I go on stage of doing very

519
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,120
well at this point but uh I don't know

520
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
you know nothing you never know yeah so

521
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,480
I used

522
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,960
to really fret about this and then I

523
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,760
realized yeah I'm just going to do the

524
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,120
best I can do and then the rest is up to

525
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,159
the universe that's well it's up to the

526
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,440
drunken guy who owns the club or the the

527
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:59,080
18 people in the audience the 50 or the

528
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,799
hundred and you know there's just too

529
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,440
many factors you can't control well you

530
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,880
can't control it's anytime you audition

531
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,840
for anything yeah it's uh it's you know

532
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,200
and and who's the you know who who might

533
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,799
be who the other Comics are there's all

534
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,880
sorts of stuff that comes into play in

535
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,240
terms of that in in uh in any audition

536
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
whether it be that or if you're going

537
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,240
into a room to audition for a role in

538
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,039
something and it and it has nothing to

539
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,520
do and a lot of the times it has nothing

540
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:31,640
to do with with your talent or or not

541
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,799
um this is off topic and this is a

542
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,039
little bit of add kicking in yeah sure I

543
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,279
don't have a problem with ADD cool I'm

544
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:42,240
I'm curious about when you're on stage

545
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,039
how present are you in your head with

546
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,840
because sometimes we go into autopilot

547
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:48,640
with our material you know are you do

548
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,120
you does your mind wander ever when

549
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,640
you're on stage my mind um will wander a

550
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,360
little on stage but uh mostly

551
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,960
if most of the time I have to say that

552
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,559
uh I it really is trying to figure stuff

553
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,880
either that why something didn't work

554
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:07,720
why it could work better what it is that

555
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,320
I should be doing down the line what the

556
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,159
but part of it is is and especially as

557
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,480
I've grown older what the [ __ ] is coming

558
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,840
next MH yeah you know it's like we got

559
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,480
through this and then we have what do we

560
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,600
[ __ ] have next right and then I'm

561
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,240
like doing two or three lines where I

562
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,559
basically I'm talking to them but my

563
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,559
brain is I do that too you yeah just

564
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,080
just the what's next yeah just want the

565
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,600
Q cards up there yeah really but I never

566
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,360
do the other thing you said which is

567
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,520
editing as it as you go yeah but that's

568
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,760
where I write on stage so that's a lot

569
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,400
of that has got to do with that did you

570
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,279
always do that or did you have to reach

571
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,760
a certain point of comfortability no I

572
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:50,159
just had always done it I always felt um

573
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,240
I always it was the way I I found I mean

574
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,120
I wrote stuff down initially I wrote

575
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,919
some of the stuff down I'd even read it

576
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,600
I didn't care I wasn't working in comedy

577
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,760
club so I didn't give a [ __ ] no there

578
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,320
was no rules I was just doing it for

579
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,200
friends and I was working out of

580
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,880
theaters that I can get my hands on and

581
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,080
invite people to come and not really

582
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,559
make any money and just do it for a kick

583
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,480
and uh so I could keep writing because

584
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,320
the playwriting you didn't get plays up

585
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,600
so this was a way I could write stuff

586
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,520
and and get it out there so uh and it

587
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:28,080
was but mostly uh it was then I just

588
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:31,440
pick topics I wanted to or have like um

589
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,840
like tonight uh it's um what did I read

590
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,159
today that uh uh you know they're doing

591
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,559
this um there's the uh you know Obama

592
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,919
finally apologizes today that you might

593
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,159
not be able to get your your shitty

594
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,799
policy I mean in seriously that's what

595
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,919
he you know it's like you know cu the

596
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,480
whole thing is is you're going to keep

597
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,720
your policy and he made that big you

598
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,600
know idiot makes the stupid statement

599
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,200
and it is and so but to me it was so

600
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
they come back with this stuff and to me

601
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,039
it was like well you know and so I

602
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,840
started thinking well now you you know

603
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,480
uh um who likes their

604
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,559
policy who the [ __ ] unless you've got a

605
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,760
you know a gold card policy who the [ __ ]

606
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,240
likes their policy it's a piece of [ __ ]

607
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,720
yeah I have what supposed to be a good

608
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,880
policy and in the end it's a shitty

609
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,360
policy so I start thinking about that

610
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,320
and then I'll kind of roll it out on

611
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,679
stage and I'll see where that goes and

612
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,159
um and it's a part of a thing I already

613
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,240
have that I've been talking about so

614
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,159
that's how it kind of works for me now

615
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,679
but then I would literally just go okay

616
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,080
here's an article in the paper and I

617
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,000
just start talking about it I was always

618
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,640
amazed like George Carlin said he he

619
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,960
wrote every single word was planned and

620
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,440
like nothing was improvised yeah I was

621
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,559
just I I can I can't imagine doing that

622
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,799
that's so precise it's such yeah and I

623
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:54,960
think Jerry does That Seinfeld there's a

624
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,559
number of people who do that and it's I

625
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,760
get it I mean I wish in a lot of ways I

626
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:06,360
wish I could do it that way um why cuz I

627
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,240
I like to write but but whoever is on

628
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,480
you know I I find it hard outside of

629
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,559
sitting around and thinking about it I

630
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,600
find it hard to write it down I find it

631
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,880
easier to write it on stage and I've

632
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,039
been reinfor part of it is is I've been

633
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,279
reinforced by audiences to to you know I

634
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,360
mean they seem to come to want to see me

635
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,840
yeah be spontaneous so yeah and it may

636
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,760
and it and a lot of it is you know the

637
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,240
other thing is is by the time I would do

638
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,000
a special 90% of what they're going to

639
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,159
see that night night I've worked on for

640
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,320
a year and a half it's written I might I

641
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,039
could write it down right right by the

642
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,120
time I get to the end of the line I

643
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,399
always wonder if I if I transcripted

644
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,919
everything that I already said and

645
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:53,480
looked through it would I would I find

646
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,840
further edits do you ever think about

647
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,799
that like um I mean not really I don't

648
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,080
because the audience edits

649
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,520
for me so I once uh interned at the coar

650
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,080
report and I and one of my jobs was to

651
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,640
write everything Steve said transcribe

652
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,679
all the tapes and I used to get so mad

653
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,000
at him for saying unnecessary things I'd

654
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,840
be sitting you don't need to say all

655
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,960
that to get to the point you know

656
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,360
because I didn't want to type it

657
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,760
all I often wonder how much of what we

658
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,039
say we don't even need to say maybe I

659
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,640
don't even need to say

660
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:27,080
this all right let me get focused again

661
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
back to our guy uh a little more

662
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,760
background on him then we'll jump into

663
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,080
the quotes and uh he was uh he lived

664
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,840

that's a lot it's a lot of peas yeah

669
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,320
yeah uh yeah but back then you to be a

670
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,039
trained physician you'd only had to use

671
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,399
a Band-Aid and

672
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,679
Stu you just let the guy he's he's got

673
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,200
you get the he gets what are those

674
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,600
things called the uh the the the the

675
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,760
things you uh where they they they suck

676
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,880

678
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,279
stuff like

679
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,520
that took two weeks to get a degree yeah

680
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,679
all right I could have been a doctor

681
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,480
then too yeah um he was uh the first

682
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,520
educator to offer a psychology course in

683
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,120
the United

684
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,960
States wow James is one of the leading

685
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,440
thinkers of the late 19th century is

686
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,039
believed by many to be one of the most

687
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,360
influential philosophers the United

688
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,120
States has ever produced probably uh

689
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,600
While others have labeled him the father

690
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,320
of American

691
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,640
psychology along with Charles Sanders

692
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,200
Pierce and John Dewey he's considered to

693
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,240
be one of the greatest figures

694
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,600
associated with the philosophical School

695
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,840
known as pragmatism and is also cited as

696
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,760
one of the founders of the functional of

697
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,279
the functional psychology he is I wonder

698
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,679
if that's a typo of the functional

699
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,279
psychology or just functional probably I

700
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,600
I don't know it's functional psychology

701
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,720
one of those wasted

702
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,640
words he also developed the opposed to a

703
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,960
functional Psychology was different

704
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,159
movement this is like you know he want

705
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,559
he wanted to be known as the

706
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:15,480
the uh he also developed the

707
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,200
philosophical perspective known as

708
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,600
radical empiricism I don't know what

709
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,760
that is do you know what that is I just

710
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,440
know I've heard it before I don't it

711
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,799
would I would fail the test now but then

712
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,200
I got it right I'll I'll Google it later

713
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,640
yeah James is work has influenced

714
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,840
intellectual Giants I don't even know

715
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,919
who radical empir so empirical is

716
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,200
taking

717
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,200
uh empirical evidence I think it's I

718
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,840
don't [ __ ] know it's it would take my

719
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,760
brain too long to compute to a

720
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,039
guess it's

721
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,000
uh I don't know if I mean it sounds like

722
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,799
take a shot at it I'm looking at

723
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,360
something I'm going to take a guess but

724
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,919
I don't that's really what I've just

725
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,240
done what I've done is radical imperal

726
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,600
empiricism all right well well well done

727
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,159
then yeah really I just did it I I gave

728
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,000
you a demonstration of what I thought

729
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,440
might be radical

730
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,760
empirical radical imperialism I know

731
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,760
what that

732
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,320
is um so lastly on him on James James

733
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,399
wrote widely on many topics including

734
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,080
epistemology education emology is what

735
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:28,399
the woman has after she has a baby is it

736
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,720
no I really don't know what it actually

737
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:35,480
otomy but what is epistemology um I

738
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,799
think it's the origin of words I think

739
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,120
[ __ ] this is just showing my

740
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,399
ignorance it's good let's get through

741
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,080
this whole thing and then people stop

742
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,679
saying I'm so [ __ ] smart I believe

743
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,240
that's what it is in part and I probably

744
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:49,480
another part of the definition I believe

745
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,600
the joke you know so I I come off worse

746
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,440
if anything so um metaphysics psychology

747
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,960
religion and mysticism mysticism I guess

748
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,320
is the psychic connection there yeah I

749
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,720
think he felt you know and these guys

750
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,000
who start doing it I mean young was in a

751
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,640
sense partly I mean the difference

752
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,799
between Freud and young was just that

753
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:15,519
Freud was uh you know it's id liido id

754
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,200
ego liido that stuff you know you break

755
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,000
the thing down you know it's your mother

756
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,080
did this your father did that but your

757
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,080
young kind of believed in dreams and the

758
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,559
whole other thing that's that's kind of

759
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,159
where James was in part uh not so much

760
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,880
in the dream thing but that there

761
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,880
something else going on you think

762
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,960
there's anything to dreams more than

763
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,880
it's just uh because I've asked other

764
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,120
guests this I'm curious what your

765
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,440
opinion is is it just a bunch of junk

766
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,679
that you pick up during the day or do

767
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,720
you think there's more to dreams than

768
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,559
that no I think there's more to it I

769
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,399
think uh I think that

770
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,600
uh um your brain is trying to tell you

771
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,519
something you know I mean I've gotten

772
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,320
stuff from my dreams you know I I have a

773
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:00,279
shrink who's really good who's uh and uh

774
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,880
I wouldn't have thought it about dreams

775
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:04,679
but we've talked about some stuff and uh

776
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,799
and I don't dream a lot I of dreaming

777
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,440
more now I I was taking chantex the

778
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,519
anti-m smoking drug because it would

779
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,880
give you wild dreams I thought wow they

780
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,320
were all going oh you know it gives you

781
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,240
really bad dreams well yeah i' like

782
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,279
something at night cuz really I was not

783
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,559
having in and I've had a a number

784
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,760
recently and a lot of it has to do with

785
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,919
whatever you know um the reasoning

786
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,919
behind it but uh but I would talk to her

787
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,360
about it and I found found um and my and

788
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,960
my friends and I my brother

789
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,720
actually uh well what I found with her

790
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,240
was is that um you know there is some

791
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:44,120
sort of uh when oh

792
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,120
that's you know as opposed to uh [ __ ]

793
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,559
why am I doing this and I'm going

794
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,880
through the what I did during the day

795
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,960
and why did I make those choices and

796
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,360
then I go here's what I dreamt oh and

797
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,840
then she goes well because of this this

798
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,480
and this well that's why I [ __ ] did

799
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,039
that so there is this there is a I

800
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,440
believe a connection um my brother used

801
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,799
to uh my brother used to be able to

802
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,960
there people who can do this control

803
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,919
those dreams yeah I've heard about that

804
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,720
yeah I wish I could do that yeah no I

805
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,320
mean so do I but I'm not I have that

806
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,720
sense of I think everybody's got that

807
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,120
sense of um you're in the middle of the

808
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,799
dream you go really this is my piece of

809
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,679

and crazier

814
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,200

people actually experience stuff it's

851
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,960
legitimate and uh and really hard to

852
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,720
dismiss a friend of one of the guys he

853
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,599

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,200
at the time he had done it and they had

862
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,040

00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,480
which is crazy yeah you know what what's

864
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,040
what hit me the hardest about all of

865
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,520
that because it was all fascinating but

866
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,159
just the idea of [ __ ] you money yeah cuz

867
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,639

kind of weird tests uh uh put on me then

895
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,280
uh you know like not you know test

896
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,800
they're like testing my per make sure

897
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,280
that I'm not a psycho or something

898
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,040
before they bring me in uh then uh

899
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,560
getting in sitting with a bunch of Suits

900
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,640
around a table and they're like welcome

901
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,800
to the NBC family with wood panel walls

902
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,920
the whole thing happened and it spanned

903
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,079
months that's unbelievable in one night

904
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,400
it was it was so weird and and I got it

905
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,760
it worked out it worked out well yeah

906
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,359
right up until the first night that I

907
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,599
was about to go on stage and then I woke

908
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,680
up I didn't get on stage but I got as

909
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,599
that's pretty amazing yeah and then you

910
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,000
and then you lay there disappointed I I

911
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,040
had a couple of Dreams recently where I

912
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,599
did where it was uh this is if this

913
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,960
better be a dream you know or this is

914
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,240
really going to be shitty those are the

915
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,720
ones but you know I woke up from that

916
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,560
dream where that that the whole point of

917
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,800
this long story is that I woke up from

918
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,319
it feeling accomplished even though I

919
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,240
that's great though I felt so much

920
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:56,040
better about life that's good I'm like I

921
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,319
experienced all that now and and that

922
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,560
was good enough and you did experience

923
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,040
it yeah you know that's what I would do

924
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,119
I would go uh a lot of the times people

925
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,960
go well aren't you disciplined you

926
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,599
didn't get that and I go well cuz they

927
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,160
would say you know I mean they're really

928
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,160
early on when something would come up

929
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,160
and then I could make a money and it

930
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,000
would be great and da and uh I would

931
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,640
spend the money in my

932
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
head so by the time I didn't get it I'd

933
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,119
already spent the

934
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,119
money I like it find a way to make

935
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,720
ourselves feel better [ __ ] the system

936
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,760
we're going to do already SP money

937
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,640
anyway so [ __ ] it yeah what's what's

938
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:37,119
next I like it yeah what

939
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,400
what is there a point in life you see I

940
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,280
get to a point where I'm like I can't

941
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,720
believe it's Thanksgiving again it was

942
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,880
just Thanksgiving a minute ago yeah

943
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,280
right it's going to get worse you know

944
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,839
yeah I imagine like it's going to get

945
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,040
really worse tell me I want to know well

946
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,480
it was August and now it's Thanksgiving

947
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,680
I mean it that was 35 seconds for me 35

948
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,280
seconds yeah September didn't exist

949
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,440
uh-huh and uh October literally it was

950
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,040
like uh a blank and it'll be

951
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,319
Thanksgiving and literally but you

952
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,040
finish packing up and put the stuff in

953
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:13,000
there and go it'll be Thanksgiving it'll

954
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,599
be Thanksgiving yeah I'm serious what's

955
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,839
the point of it all what's the point of

956
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:18,599
life what do you think is the point yeah

957
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,680
what do you think is the point of us

958
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,119
doing this again and again and again

959
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,240
well I mean just to get it to do it

960
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,520
better I really think that's the deal

961
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,240
the idea is is you know this a you know

962
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,280
the last Christmas was shitty this this

963
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,960
will be the good Christmas oh this is

964
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,200
shitty too but you know next Christmas

965
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,680
is going to be great MH um I think but I

966
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,040
think really the point of going through

967
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,720
it again and again and again is to try

968
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,920
to get it right I mean that's the way I

969
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:48,119
open my act now I mean it's that uh that

970
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,839
I think that that's really I mean that's

971
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,839
not what I say and but that's really

972
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,800
what I think the point of it is that you

973
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,040
um that you wake up every day and you

974
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,480
try to learn a little more about

975
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,720
yourself and try to keep be a little a

976
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,400
little more open and try to become more

977
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,839
part of what the hell everything is and

978
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,720
uh and hope that uh you know and and

979
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,520
that you you know you I mean basically

980
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,319
you know you find ways to try to cope

981
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,319
with life because it

982
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,800
sucks um we got two quotes here I

983
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,560
usually ask the guests to read the

984
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,000
quotes and then we try and make heads or

985
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,720
tailes of them and wrap the show like

986
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,400
that okay the stronghold of the

987
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,200
determinist argument is the antipathy to

988
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,160
the idea of chance

989
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,359
this notion of alternative possibility

990
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,960
this admission that any one of several

991
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:37,800
things may come to pass is after all

992
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,560
only a roundabout name for

993
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,319
chance I can read it

994
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:48,200
backwards and it just as much chance for

995
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:52,000
name roundabout a only all after is Bast

996
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:54,040
to come May things several of one any

997
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,960
that admission this possibility

998
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,680
alternative of notion this chance of

999
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:05,160
ideas to the antiy is the argument

1000
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:07,079
determinist the of stronghold the made

1001
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,000
more sense that it makes it makes more

1002
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,800
sense that way actually uh the um I have

1003
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,599
noide

1004
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:20,079
the list you know that thing you do on

1005
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:22,880
stage uh I don't know why um what you

1006
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,000
you're Blown Away by something that that

1007
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,880
that's that internally is how I feel

1008
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,440
when I hear this stuff yeah I mean all

1009
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,720
it is and I don't quite understand it

1010
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,880
because it's he says look the the the

1011
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,319
fact that people believe in determinism

1012
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,480
which is is that everything is already

1013
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,640
played out for us is against the idea of

1014
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:44,520
that it's the possibility of Randomness

1015
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:46,839
and then I don't know why um uh that uh

1016
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,920
you know and then that the fact that

1017
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:51,800
that several things may come to pass as

1018
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,839
opposed to one is what chance is so [ __ ]

1019
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,520
it doesn't the psychic knowing these

1020
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,839
things sort of prove determinism though

1021
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,800
like no he just knows that uh you know

1022
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:04,440
because it's you're going to you you

1023
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,280
choose to do things that get you to

1024
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,680
there but if he's saying don't worry

1025
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,240
about your friend Lewis he's going to be

1026
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,440
okay it almost implies you don't have a

1027
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,560
choice in the matter you're going to be

1028
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,280
okay whether you like it or not yeah

1029
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,160
that's great that's bonus points but

1030
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,480
where's the free choice that well here's

1031
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,160
the free choice he didn't have to tell

1032
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,359
me a b he tells me now I [ __ ] relax a

1033
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,880
little and don't when I have to deal

1034
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,560
with something don't [ __ ] worry about

1035
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,520
it cuz is uh this guy I don't know is

1036
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,280
that everything's going to be okay

1037
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,040
that's good you're you you're in good

1038
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,599
hands in other words yeah I you know he

1039
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,160
knows you know it I mean in a lot of

1040
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:46,520
ways you know I mean it's uh it

1041
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,599
helps um to have that kind of

1042
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,040
faith I mean you know there's the

1043
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,200
psychotic faith that you know some you

1044
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,400
know uh of the of certain Christians is

1045
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,200
like beyond belief but the basic faith

1046
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,440
that it's going to it's going to work

1047
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,119
out as opposed to you know I'm a piece

1048
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,760
of [ __ ] but you know why I don't I'm not

1049
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,560
going to amount to nothing I'm a piece

1050
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,000
of [ __ ] is you know I think whatever you

1051
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,680
I don't think it's you know oprish but I

1052
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,440
don't think it helps if you know you

1053
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,599
don't really a you don't like sitting

1054
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,280
down with people who think they're

1055
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,440
pieces of [ __ ] right I mean it's just

1056
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,960
exhausting at least pretend you're not a

1057
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,280
piece of [ __ ] for the 20 minutes we

1058
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,280

really no it's true um all right here's

1062
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:38,119
the second one I'll it's this one here I

1063

00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:57,920
ofier the sustaining of a thought

1071
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,440
because I choose to when I might have

1072
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,599
other thoughts need to be the definition

1073
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,599
of

1074
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,240
Illusion this definition need to be at

1075
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,119
any rate I will assume for the president

1076
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,400
till next year that it is no illusion My

1077
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:14,520
First Act of Free Will shall be to

1078
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,319
believe in Free

1079
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,400
Will wow I don't know how he have you

1080
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,480
write something like that and then I'd

1081
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,119
have to take a nap unless he was unless

1082
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,920
it was determined that he'd believe in

1083
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,520
Free Will and he had no choice in the

1084
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,839
matter well that's what they would say

1085
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,880
that's but that's what how you make a

1086
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,520
living you see you could be that's all

1087
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,720
you got to do you take the Counterpoint

1088
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,200
to that right you know and then he says

1089
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,200
well the reason I know that I have free

1090
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,079
will is because and then he'll have

1091
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,280
whatever his argument you go well [ __ ]

1092
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,839
you and he goes back cter that's what it

1093
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,440
is I mean I I I've known a couple of I

1094
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:52,480
knew actually someone who was going for

1095
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,760
a doctor in philosophy and uh they were

1096
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,599
uh it was like crazy bill I mean it is

1097
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,119
it's it's

1098
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,520
a ton of thought I mean if you really

1099
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:05,079
want to read a great uh book in terms of

1100
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,480
just simple philosophy is and it's goofy

1101
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,960
but it's it's it's it's really kind of

1102
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,440
puts philosophy in a

1103
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,880
more it's a philosophical book that is

1104
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,960
not a philosophical book is Zen In The

1105
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,960
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance which is

1106
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,359
just a

1107
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,720
great uh sense of um it's a guy who

1108
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,480
completely I think I as I remember it

1109
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:29,079
who the [ __ ] knows but it's a guy who

1110
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,400
really kind of has to makes it kind of

1111
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,319
loses it a bit and then um comes back

1112
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,960
and how it he puts it all together and

1113
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,400
that in a sense is philosophy I mean

1114
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,280
it's in in part m i mean because the end

1115
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,640
of this amount of thought is the [ __ ]

1116
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,760
nut

1117
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,680
house I mean really I think a lot of

1118
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,920
these guys were crazy you know yeah they

1119
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,240
were I mean it's they think a lot you

1120
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:55,200
know a lot of this would be called

1121
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:58,280
obsessive compulsive Behavior or um the

1122
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,319
I mean that's in part I think why I was

1123
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,440
why playwriting was suited me in a sense

1124
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:08,119
because it's this obsessive compulsive

1125
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:11,359
kind of of a uh um of a craft and I mean

1126
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:14,800
as as as as probably any art is to a

1127
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,839
point um is opposed to stand up which is

1128
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,119
not that it's not obsessive and

1129
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,880
compulsive except for the fact that I've

1130
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,760
got to get back there tomorrow and you

1131
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,319
know and find out what the what will

1132
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,720
make the joke work um uh there's not but

1133
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,480
border by

1134
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,280
bolar you know I'm sure that a lot of

1135
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,000
these guys must have been or some of

1136
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,280
them for sure must have been bipolar I

1137
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,040
wonder if you see it in the book where

1138
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,960
it starts getting really one way and

1139
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,720
then the other it's like oh he seems

1140
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,800
very positive about life the problem

1141
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,119
yeah the problem no but it isn't bipolar

1142
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,520
is mostly that they uh uh just kind of

1143
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,760
laser in on something and then become

1144
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,319
completely obsessed with it to the point

1145
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,760
of and uh um I've I've been around

1146
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:00,119
bipolar and it's

1147
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,040
it comes in all sorts of forms I mean I

1148
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,520
I knew this this novelist uh who was

1149
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,559
writing four different books at one time

1150
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,599
I mean it's like and bipolar I mean it's

1151
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,440
just like you know go there go there go

1152
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:15,680
there go there I mean it's yeah you know

1153
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,559
it's crazy though I wonder if I guess

1154
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,599
they're not aware most bipolar people

1155
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,680
are not self-aware enough to know that

1156
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,319
they're bipolar well it's good when they

1157
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,079
find out because it takes a toll on

1158
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,480
those around them I mean now it's more

1159
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,920
known I mean literally I would say that

1160
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,160
a lot of I'm not so sure of add I mean I

1161
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,680
think that there's part in there's a

1162
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,960
problem there but I also think that can

1163
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,640
be you know it doesn't need to be it's

1164
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,839
focusing okay so [ __ ] you know if the

1165
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,359
if if if Indian philosophy can take us

1166
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:48,520
to the point that you can meditate on

1167
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:49,680
something that's internal then [ __ ] you

1168
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,359
you you should be able to get somebody

1169
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,960
to focus on something that's external

1170
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:58,240
but I mean bipolar and um uh depressive

1171
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,160
personalities and all of that I mean

1172
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,599
there's just been more and more of an

1173
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,559
understanding of that in in the course

1174
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,040
of our lifetime but this guy didn't seem

1175
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:09,280
to be depressed oh Bill not if you come

1176
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,119
up not if you got 19 jobs and uh and

1177
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,599
come up and can think that much it's

1178
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,400
definitely productive and uh if you want

1179
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,480

you're going to read one of his books

1197
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,400
the word experience is the only thing

1198
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,800
