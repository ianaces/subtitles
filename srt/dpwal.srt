17
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,239
when you're away from home and you miss

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,960
home you just go to the southern Embassy

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,000
and then you can be around people who

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,320
remind you of home and everything sorry

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,880
I always mess this joke up sorry I said

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,880
the southern Embassy I meant Walmart uh

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,439
[ __ ] I do that every time I'm

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,880
sorry I don't even call it Walmart or

25
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,000
the southern Embassy anymore to be

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,000
honest with you guys I just call it the

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,240
place White Privilege goes to die uh and

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,079
here's why every time I walk into a

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,560
Walmart I have have the exact same

30
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,320
thought and that thought is how am I

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,320
doing better than every white person in

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,759
here is somebody playing a trick on me

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,040
what is

34
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,479
happening Walmart's in the midwest are

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,079
so crazy like I feel like you couldn't

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,640
put historical context to them like

37
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,920
they're that nut like if I could dig up

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,360
Dr King and bring him back to life and

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,479
just push him through the automatic

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,520
doors of the Walmart on the south side

41
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,000
of the

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,000
he just walk in and be like

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,280
[ __ ] this was my actual dream right

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,840
here look at all these white people

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,000
doing

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,080
terribly I couldn't say it in that

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,080
speech but this is what I

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,280
wanted also Dante is Dale Earnhart Jr

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,400
our

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,879
president I'm only asking because

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,840
everyone has on his pajama bottom

52
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,840
so I thought maybe it was a law

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,440
that's Dante Powell the squirrels get

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,440
