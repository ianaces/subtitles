1
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,795
Hey, thanks for watching my DVD.

2
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:15,595
Uh, this Is a one person sitcom, uh,

3
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:17,315
me moving back to Duluth, Minnesota.

4
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:20,475
And so, uh, thanks for watching.

5
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,635
And, uh, the bridge is going up.

6
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,675
So it's time to start the show.

7
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:10,145
That's super nasty. Yes.

8
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:13,665
Um, listen, so here I'm gonna, if some of you guys seem

9
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:16,465
to came to see standup, uh, it might be a bit disappointing

10
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:18,905
because this is a one person shoe

11
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:21,625
and, uh, uh, then, uh,

12
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:24,465
but that the thing is, the cool thing about that is that it,

13
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:28,785
the theme of the show is disappointment. And that, uh,

14
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:32,465
Sometimes Life doesn't almost turn out as you planned,

15
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,985
but something magnificent and incredible

16
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,145
and magical that you never could have dreamed

17
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:42,225
of happens instead or not.

18
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:46,705
So, uh, like all of us here tonight, uh,

19
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:49,465
I have always believed I deserve to have my own sitcom.

20
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:54,665
And, uh, I've been to Hollywood, I've auditioned, uh, Maria.

21
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:59,065
Uh, so read through the part and just be yourself.

22
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,385
That's really my only note. We just wanna see who you are.

23
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:06,145
So be yourself. Have fun with it. Any questions? No.

24
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:09,185
Okay, go ahead. Uh, and then I read the part

25
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:13,025
and I be myself, and I say, okay, um,

26
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,545
I know I told you to be yourself, um,

27
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:18,305
but we really need the character to be likable

28
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,145
and, uh, oh, we got the wrong person.

29
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,985
Uh, so I went, uh, uh,

30
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:28,585
have an agent and she's real positive. Maria,

31
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,585
This industry has a DD right now.

32
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:32,745
I'm looking at you and you're amazing,

33
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,865
and your brilliant you, you're superb,

34
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:36,025
and you're everything that we are looking for.

35
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,545
And then suddenly it's gone. And I'm bored, I'm irritated.

36
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:40,505
I wanna get a cup of coffee or something to eat.

37
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:42,545
And then I don't know what it is you did or didn't do,

38
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:43,825
but I am back in again.

39
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:46,105
And you are superlative and you are hyperbole,

40
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:48,785
and you are a polar bear in the jungle,

41
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,865
and you are a giant, within a giant being a

42
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:51,905
giant bowl of jello.

43
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,865
And it's gone get outta my office.

44
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,265
And, uh, so I got a lot of, some

45
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,085
of my friends are really successful in show business

46
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,285
and, uh, they go to a lot of groups for support.

47
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:06,525
We go to a lot of sport groups and, uh, groups for support.

48
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,265
And, uh,

49
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:11,205
Hi, my name is Linda. I am

50
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:12,745
Hi Linda.

51
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,205
I am a sex addict, alcoholic, codependent and clutter.

52
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,285
Um, I'm a codependent clutter, actually.

53
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:24,485
And, um, I'm no longer storing other people's watercraft.

54
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:28,965
Um, I'm literally not taking people's s**t anymore.

55
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:33,725
And, um, I was thinking, um, you know,

56
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,085
where my pain comes from.

57
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,045
And I started, I started, uh,

58
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,045
modeling when I was two months old,

59
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:42,125
and I went straight to the top.

60
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,125
And then somebody said, why don't you try acting?

61
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,285
And I said, fine. And,

62
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,645
and I was recently weightlift, uh, waitlisted

63
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,005
for an Academy Award

64
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,685
and let, let a lot of people know

65
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:52,765
about the weightlifting system.

66
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:56,085
But, um, I thought, you know,

67
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,205
I'm gonna do something this year that I have no talent

68
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,525
and no gift, no and no desire to do.

69
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:02,285
And I, so I started working with Clay

70
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,405
and started throwing pots.

71
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:08,085
And guess, guess who has a,

72
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:11,285
A Two year Guggenheim Fellowship and ceramics.

73
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,845
It's like everything, everything I touch

74
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:14,855
Turns to gold.

75
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:20,885
So I'm a I'm gonna make my own sitcom.

76
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,325
I don't need any help. I don't need, I don't need a,

77
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:24,805
you know, a a a network.

78
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,085
Uh, okay, or a, a script

79
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,565
or a, you know, a I got friends, right?

80
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:33,445
Uh, I don't, I everybody loves Maria,

81
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:34,645
or everybody hates Maria.

82
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:36,645
Whatever pop show is more popular right now.

83
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:39,165
Um, here, here's the premise.

84
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:43,925
Let's just say, uh, slightly built, uh, except

85
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,125
for a Sky Dancer.

86
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:48,365
Uh, I'm currently current calling this area

87
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:51,485
of my Body Sky Dancer 'cause she's so beautiful at night.

88
00:04:56,545 --> 00:05:00,205
Oh, Oh, oh, good night, sky Dancer. Oh, oh, good night.

89
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,725
So, uh, uh, yeah, slightly built, 30 5-year-old comedian,

90
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:11,005
uh, suffer as a nervous breakdown on stage at the Detroit

91
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:13,845
Cavity castle, and is forced to move home with her parents.

92
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:15,925
Oh, let's just say that happened.

93
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:20,645
And, uh, I was doing my hilarious comedy jokes,

94
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:23,125
stories on stage at the Detroit Comedy Castle.

95
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:25,485
Uh, when the gentleman stood up in the front row

96
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,125
and said, I'm so f*****g bored.

97
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,685
I'm so sick of you and your voices.

98
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,125
Why don't you bring the other guy on?

99
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:38,485
I thought, I completely agree with your level

100
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,605
of frustration, sir, because this is the problem

101
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:42,725
with comedy clubs, because there is too vague

102
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:43,765
and they're advertising.

103
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,365
I said, we're gonna be having some comedy.

104
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:48,085
What kind of comedy? Well, it's gonna be comedy,

105
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,285
so it's gonna be hilarious.

106
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,205
Well, is it gonna be the kind of comedy that I like,

107
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,365
which is barrel trusted Polynesian men

108
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:55,765
who tell caustic one-liners,

109
00:05:56,665 --> 00:06:01,205
Not necessarily Ladies drink free.

110
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,525
You know, I told the guy, I said, Hey, listen, buddy, uh,

111
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:06,445
I totally know I like a certain kind of comedy.

112
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,885
I only like phone-based prop work and political magic.

113
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:11,685
Uh, that's it.

114
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:14,925
And, uh, I go to some show, I have a couple drinks,

115
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,245
sit in the back, get angry, start, you know, some,

116
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,645
because it would be some guy, you know,

117
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,765
talking about his kids

118
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:21,805
or some lady making balloon and animals mama.

119
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:23,565
And I'd say, this isn't comedy. They'd be

120
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,045
like, get it off stage.

121
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:26,845
You suck. Tell us a joke.

122
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:29,565
And then I learned to read,

123
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,845
and now I sound it out.

124
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,365
I go, I look at the marquee and I'm like, who's up tonight?

125
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:38,765
Okay, Maria, hold it right there.

126
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,725
I don't like women and I don't speak Spanish.

127
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:44,725
I'm not gonna go see that show.

128
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:49,525
And, uh, so I, anyways, so, uh, I did the rest of my set,

129
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:53,805
uh, with tears coming slowly, uh, from my eyes,

130
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:56,845
which is really quite funny in retrospect.

131
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:00,365
And, uh, I, I went back to the hotel

132
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,685
and I did this weird thing.

133
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,685
I was trying to write jokes, but while I did it, I,

134
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:04,885
I heard this screaming,

135
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:06,405
and it turns out it was coming from me

136
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:07,965
and it wouldn't stop for 10 months.

137
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:10,805
And that was kind of weird. And, uh, so I just said,

138
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:14,765
I'm gonna take some time off, go back to Duluth, uh, to, uh,

139
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:16,285
which is, uh, near, uh, Canada,

140
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:17,765
where the kind of gentle people are.

141
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:21,125
And, um, take an undisclosed amount of time off.

142
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,405
Just take a break. And I was on my way home

143
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,725
and I was reading the Northwest Airlines in Flight Magazine,

144
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:27,445
where I get most of my spirituality.

145
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:32,285
And, uh, I read, uh, they did this study about happiness.

146
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,605
And they said, uh, the variables in an economic study, uh,

147
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:39,245
that make people happy are, uh, relationships, uh, ah,

148
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,405
modicum of food and shelter,

149
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,725
and then, uh, some sort of safety, you know,

150
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:47,245
and then, uh, that money property like stuff

151
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,405
and, uh, prestige or success have no effect on people's

152
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,525
level of happiness.

153
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,925
And I thought, oh my God, I have been totally

154
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:57,525
focusing on the wrong things.

155
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:00,445
I have gotten my priorities all screwed up.

156
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:02,365
I don't want to be happy.

157
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,965
Oh, I want to be rich, famous and miserable.

158
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:20,085
And, uh, so that, that's of course not true

159
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:23,565
because I, so what I was, uh, travel with my pug, uh,

160
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:25,605
blossom, uh, blasting as a pug,

161
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,765
come here bossy.

162
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,485
I bought blossom for, uh,

163
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:39,525
$30 from a disreputable breeder in Costa Mesa, California,

164
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:42,005
who told me she was 1-year-old.

165
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:43,325
And then I brought her to the vet.

166
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:46,525
The vet said she is eight years old, and she's a day,

167
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,085
and she spanks.

168
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,125
She has, uh, has three teeth, which is really all I need

169
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,605
to make cook work of a sausage.

170
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,205
And, uh, she, uh, has these,

171
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:03,165
I don't know if you can see in these long cow,

172
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:05,965
like s which is, you know, uh,

173
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,125
because she had lots of babies,

174
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,605
and, uh, we don't know where they are,

175
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,165
but she's open to them contacting her.

176
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,005
Uh, so bla

177
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,605
sometimes when we touch,

178
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,485
The Honesty is too much.

And I have to, okay. Alright.

180
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:36,245

00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:39,485
guest bedroom, which is really a pillow museum storage unit.

182
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:42,885
And, uh, uh, my parents, I usually get home late.

00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:46,565

207
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:23,845
Did you wanna die at Coke for breakfast? Hello, blossom.

208
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:28,285
Sweetie. You need to get the, the, the, the sheet

209
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:31,445
between your skin and the quilt because your skin has oils.

210
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:34,245
Honey. It has oils. Can I just get in there?

211
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:36,885
Can I just get in there? You don't have to get up.

212
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:39,085
You don't have to get up, mother.

213
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,725
I must wash the sludge of humanity from my skin.

214
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:47,765
Well, honey, honey, glass of listen, honey, sweetie,

215
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:49,725
are you gonna go take a shower?

216
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,485
Can I tell you something real quick there?

217
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,165
Can I get, can I get in there real quick?

218
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,165
Can I just, oh, I just,

219
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:56,765
I just, I didn't know you were naked.

220
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:58,085
You got undressed so quickly.

221
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,765
Honey, listen, listen

222
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:06,445
honey, if you want, if you wanna get breast

223
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,045
implants, we will support you.

224
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:12,565
You know, not, not, not financially, but, but emotionally.

225
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:16,885
Do not push your mother. Do not push your mother.

226
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:18,765
Listen, listen, that basket

227
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:21,165
of socks is in there for a reason.

228
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:25,045
Because you, when you're wet, feet come out of the bath,

229
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,045
they're wet, and then they, I know you can't see it,

230
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,765
you don't believe me, but there's a layer

231
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:30,685
of dust on the bathroom floor,

232
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,925
and then it hits the white carpeting

233
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:34,925
and it creates a grime, honey,

234
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:38,325
It creates a crime.

235
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:42,605
I said, hello, blossom. How are you to it?

236
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,485
I know I wouldn't, I would pet you, but I'm allergic.

237
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,525
I I have distended teeths too, honey.

238
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:55,285
Listen sweetie, maybe we should get her a T-shirt

239
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:58,525
or something so she could have some privacy.

240
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,445
Listen, I'm just worried

241
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:01,965
what you're gonna be doing this week

242
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,245
because I, I, I got a lot of things going on.

243
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,485
I've got man a pedicure on Tuesday,

244
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,405
and then Rita's coming to clean.

245
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,805
So I'm trying to keep things clean for when she comes

246
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:14,005
to clean, and I'm just exhausted, sweetie.

247
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:15,565
Listen, sweetie.

248
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,685
So what do you, sweetie?

249
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:21,765
You're gonna, you're gonna put on some makeup, right?

250
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:27,805
Put on a little makeup for your mother. Mom, I'm off work.

251
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:31,445
I don't have to put on the clown mask, sweetie.

252
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,365
Aren't you worried? You know, what if Mike's at the,

253
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,165
at the at target?

254
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,085
What if you see him, mom,

255
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:39,605
he's married and has three children.

256
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,965
I don't think he's gonna ask me to the prom.

257
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:48,245
See, when you don't wear makeup, you look mentally ill

258
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:51,605
Mother, you,

259
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:54,445
You don't want, you call yourself a Christian.

260
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,965
And yet Jesus Christmas would say, I look.

261
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:58,285
He would say, I look hot.

262
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,365
You know, he would say, I look Really, really?

263
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:03,525
Jesus doesn't know anyone at Target, honey.

264
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:07,925
No, listen, so whatcha gonna be doing with yourself

265
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:10,405
because I just wanted, I can't entertain you, mom.

266
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:11,565
I've got tons of stuff.

267
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,445
I just, I saw, uh, I saw a friend from high school,

268
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:15,685

269
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:17,645
So we maybe we're gonna maybe hang out, right?

So anyways, are you coming?

Rob at Jubilee Foods.

287
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:59,445
She's so funny. She says, she says Maria's depressed.

288
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:02,965
She's on Prozac. Which is so funny because I cut myself.

289
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:07,925
So I'm on Effexor and antipsychotics. Brian.

290
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,605
Brian, get over here.

291
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:12,245
I remember Bri, we had IES a couple years ago,

292
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:14,045
and neither of us had any health insurance.

293
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,805
And then, but we were, you know, so we didn't cooperate.

294
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:18,165
It was a soft cough case.

295
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,245
We got hundred thousands of dollars in debt.

296
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,725
And I was just so stressed out. Brian didn't had a job.

297
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:24,085
And then we just, we had ies,

298
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:25,245
premature babies, little girls.

299
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:29,765
And so I would just cut myself just to relax. Just to relax.

300
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,525
And now I just wanna watch.

301
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,445
I watched my tbo episodes

302
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:36,765
of Survivor Pal out, and I just cry.

303
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:41,445
So remember that one time in high school?

304
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:46,565

307
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,725
And Marie goes, we were playing,

308
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,525
and this volleyball hits her in the head

309
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,845
and she act like she's acting like no big deal.

310
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,885
Volleyball just hit me in the head. No big deal.

311
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:02,885
Like you, like it didn't hurt her.

312
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,205
And then another one hit you in the head,

313
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:06,885
and then another one,

314
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:10,285
and it's like your head was attracting volleyball.

315
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:12,565
And I says, oh my God,

316
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,965
I'm in here, her in the head on purpose.

317
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:15,685
This is the look on your face.

318
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,085

just a little concealer on your upper lip

because you have a darkening.

333
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:56,925
It's called a melasma,

334
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:59,605
and it's caused by having too much estrogen

335
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:00,805
pigment in your skin.

336
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:02,685

00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:49,085
Blessy down by the river. Your poppy. Yeah.

348
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,405
Motorcycle ride with a bag

349
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:55,965
and some rocks, Joe.

350
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:59,885
Oh my God. Oh, you scared me. You scared me.

351
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,085
Oh, I didn't know. I

352
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:13,325
listen Honey Maria,

353
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:16,685
I was watching Maria upstairs take a shower,

354
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:20,805
and she was, has this mole on her butt,

355
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:22,325
and it just looks odd.

356
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:24,845
And I just think as a dermatologist in the family,

357
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,565
you should take a look at it.

358
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:28,525
Jesus Christ. Marilyn,

359
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:33,085
I'm not gonna take a look at my daughter's, you know?

360
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:35,885
Yes. She, she has, she has healthcare.

361
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:38,565
She, she can get a, you know, a referral.

362
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:41,365
Um, besides, I don't think a,

363
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,725
a melanoma would be the first thing you would

364
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:44,805
notice about her.

365
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:48,565
My goodness. Looking very, very good. Maria. What?

366
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:53,125
Oh s**t, Maria. What mother?

367
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:55,005
I'm wearing makeup.

368
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,085
I'm wearing thick green eyeshadow

369
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:01,165
and a line of lipstick around my lips.

370
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,925
Maybe look pretty now. Mommy,

371
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,165
Mary.

372
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:15,365
Okay, sweetie. What? It's just too much.

373
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,885
Why don't you stay at your sisters, honey?

374
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:21,885
Is your sisters okay? We love you. We love you. We love you.

375
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:26,605
We love you. But it's hard to be around you.

376
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:31,165
So I'm gonna go downstairs. I'll see you at Target, honey.

377
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:34,365
Very funny.

378
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:39,125
I see my new invention.

379
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,165
Yeah, dad, totally. Okay.

380
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,205
You know, patients come into me,

381
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:48,965
you know, I'm a dermatologist.

382
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:51,405
Patients come into me and say, oh, Dr.

383
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:55,085
Banford, I have a, you know, rash on my arm.

384
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:01,005
Okay? And, uh, you know,

385
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,605
and, uh, you know, I say, well put a topical cream on it,

386
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,205
you know, you know.

387
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:11,885
And, uh, if you, if you need to wash it, don't use soap.

388
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:15,445
Don't use soap. Soap is drying irritating to the skin.

389
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:19,645
You need to wash it. Pat, pat, pat. Wet wash cloth.

390
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,325
Hair dry. Hair dry.

391
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,205
You know, one of people always say to me,

392
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:31,005
they say, oh, but Dr. Bradford isn't there some kind

393
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,245
of special, so I can

394
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:36,045
use little soap.

395
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:40,125
Soap, soap is drying irritating to the skin.

396
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:44,365
You need soap with wet,

397
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:49,885
and then it never stop.

398
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,925
You go, oh, salt, salt.

399
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,485
So I went on in my wood shop

400
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,205
and I came up with this, okay, it's a bar of wood, okay?

401
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:01,685
Shaped like a bar of soup.

402
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:06,965
And, and I, uh, I say, oh, why don't you try this?

403
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:11,325
And then they say, oh, Dr. Bamford, I'd say, bar of wood.

404
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:13,125
Won't I get splinters?

405
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:18,605
I say, oh yeah, better not use it.

406
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,765
Pretty good, huh? Wait, what?

407
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:32,285
That, that is the most long-winded, passive aggressive way

408
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:33,925
of getting someone to do something.

409
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:35,765
And I like it.

410
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,525
Uh, what is your agency?

411
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:44,845
I want you No, you don't much time off what?

412
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,325
Your agency. I didn't, she doesn't care.

413
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:49,965
Last time I saw her, she said,

414
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,285
Maria, when I first met you, I was concerned.

415
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:53,885
I was gonna be annoyed by you

416
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:58,085
because you have a high grading childlike voice.

417
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,845
You, you need to know that about yourself.

418
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:06,005
I don't, I don't think she'll be missing me too much. Mom.

419
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:10,245
You see one down taking your meds.

420
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:17,285
Yes, I'm taking my meds. Are you taking your meds?

421
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:23,045
I got about seven going right now. Yeah. I got a zero tech

422
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:25,885
Acid reflux.

423
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:29,365
Uh, you know, and then I got a, uh,

424
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:31,765
taking Prozac for the darkness.

425
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:34,805
And then I got, uh, I got this, this is new

426
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:36,085
after the prize to eat surgery.

427
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,245
I got, uh, it is just, you know, temporary.

428
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:41,285
But it's a, it's a little pee bag and don't tell blossom.

429
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,445
But I've been marking s**t around the house.

430
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:47,205
It is just the stuff that's mine.

431
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:51,645
And, uh, you know, so, and then I got this new medication.

432
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,245
Get this. It's a heart medication.

433
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,245
If I don't take it for one day,

434
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:58,245
It's Ra.

435
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:01,805
Can you believe it? Oh, I just, you know,

436
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:02,885
got caught up in something.

437
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:08,605
Goodbye. Well, I just don't know.

438
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:11,645
Just got busy and then I forgot o

439
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:17,925
Dad.

440
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:21,485
Uh, did you, did you take that medication today? What?

441
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:29,115
Oh s**t. So I

442
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:30,875
usually end up at my sister's house.

443
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:33,075
Uh, my sister, uh, come on glossy.

444
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,235
Uh, my sister is a pathologist though.

445
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:40,315
I like to introduce her as, this is my sister Sarah.

446
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:44,955
She cuts up the dead into chunks and, uh,

447
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:47,605
'cause she's my older sister.

448
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,685
And, uh, she, uh, she has a pug too. Hey, buttercup.

449
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:56,085
Buttercup blossom. Buttercup blossom.

450
00:23:57,505 --> 00:24:00,605
Uh, so ramp, do you get kicked outta the house? Uhhuh.

Do you want three Diet Cokes? Do you want five?

We can bring 'em. I mean, it's no problem. They're cool.

465
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,365
table playing with their Polly pockets.

466
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,085
One is aimlessly wandering with a spatula,

467
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,365
and the other one is taking up a nap.

468
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:44,005
20 minutes and counting. Okay?

00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:10,845
mom said you had a new joke about me.

478
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:12,965
What's your joke? What's your joke?

479
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:16,405
It's not even a joke about you,

480
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,565
it's just a generic sister joke.

481
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:23,885
Mm-Hmm. Take a left. Hey, what's your joke? Joker.

482
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:29,365
Okay. It's about, it's a, it's okay. It goes like this.

483
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:32,045
Uh, my sister and I had the same voice, so, uh,

484
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:34,365
over the holidays though, so it's hard for me

485
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:36,885
to do impersonation of her, but she can take a left.

486
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:38,725
Take a left. Take a left up here. Okay. You did it.

487
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:40,405
You did it. You're doing it. You're doing it. Okay, great.

488
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,405
Do you wanna hear? Do you wanna hear this or not? No, no.

489
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:45,005
I'm listening. I listening. You're doing what I'm saying.

490
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:49,085
You're doing what I'm saying. It's cool. Okay.

491
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:50,445
My sister, we have the same voice,

492
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:52,485
but she came up with an impersonation

493
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,845
of me over the holidays, and it goes like this.

494
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:58,125
My name is Maria, and I think I'm a big deal,

495
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,925
so I don't have to do the dishes or

496
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,365
We up before noon And blah, blah, blah.

497
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:06,925
Jib, jib, jib, Clang, clang, cl.

498
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,925
And then I say it's a pretty good likeness.

499
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:16,205
Maria, Bri, Aaron noticed every joke you

500
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,565
tell, you're the victim.

501
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:24,225
And yet, and yet every,

502
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:28,465
every joke you tell you do an impersonation of someone else.

503
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,185
Okay? Or someone from our family.

504
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:32,265
Who's the victim now, buddy?

505
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:34,985
Huh? Who's the victim now?

506
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,345
Hey, Maria, you remember how, uh, you know,

507
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:41,225
I was reading this medical journal, I forgot to tell you.

508
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,625
Okay? You have, you have

509
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,565
that one dark curly hair that comes outta your neck.

510
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:48,365
You've seen it, right? That one dark,

511
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,645
curly, creepy, disgusting hair.

512
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:52,165
You've seen it. I'm just

513
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:53,245
Trying to help you.

514
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:56,325
Okay? And then your breasts will look really small, dude.

515
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:58,525
It's called cs. It's a syndrome.

516
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:00,485
You gotta get your hormones checked other way.

517
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:03,405
You're gonna be like, I'm like, wake up next day

518
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:05,245
and be like, covered in fur, like a werewolf.

519
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:12,195
Shut Up, Sarah. Oh, you shut up

520
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:13,865
Fast. Watch

521
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:14,325


522
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:17,595
Yet,

523
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:27,515
Sarah, maybe I tell a joke from being a victim because I,

524
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:30,275
because I am a victim, you know?

525
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,915
Mm-Hmm. Listen, we all have genetic defects.

526
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,315
Look at me, at me.

527
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,195
I got giant horse teeth.

528
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:45,195
You don't see me crying.

529
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:49,995
Why don't you go to one of your groups,

530
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,155
One of your groups for support?

531
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:56,385
Support.

532
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,755
You are just jealous. 'cause there's no support groups

533
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:02,555
for bossy people with horse teeth.

534
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:04,955
I'm going to my groups totally helping.

535
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:07,275
I, I just, I've been, you know, people call me

536
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:09,115
and, you know, we support each other or whatever.

537
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:11,355
And, uh, I just got a call it, eh,

538
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:16,705
It's Linda.

539
00:28:17,255 --> 00:28:19,315
Oh my God. What's going on? Are you okay? Are you okay?

540
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:23,115
Okay. Uh, I'm at the Tate Gallery in London.

541
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:27,555
Um, they're, they're doing a retrospective on my

542
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,635
ashtrays and toothbrush holders.

543
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,195
Um, okay.

544
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:35,355
Um, you know,

545
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:38,635
a apple sauce?

546
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:45,115
Yeah. Like what is in a six,

547
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:47,235
six compartments.

548
00:28:47,615 --> 00:28:51,475
And Then it has aluminum foil over the top,

549
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:53,355
and then it's

550
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:56,275
Like, like a picnic pack, like a, like a snack pack.

551
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:59,435
Oh my God. It is so great to talk to someone

552
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:00,715
who knows what I'm talking about.

553
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:06,755
It's like, you know, sometimes I just think,

554
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:08,115
you know, where am I going?

555
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:09,875
You know, what am I doing? You know?

556
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:13,075
And am I always going be like this? You know? And

557
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:15,115
Me too. I mean, I don't

558
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:16,335
know. I don't know what's going on.

559
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,535
I don't, I mean, I don't have any plan. You know? It's okay.

560
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:20,695
It's okay. It's okay.

561
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:27,255
Yeah. And then, you know, sometimes you have that,

562
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:31,175
you know, when you, like, you, you realize,

563
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:32,375
you know, everything's okay.

564
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:35,655
You know, like, like I was walking past Barney's last week

565
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:39,695
and I said, okay, if it's meant to be, and I went inside

566
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:44,205
and that cashmere tube top was, was 25% off.

567
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:49,325
And it's like, okay, I, I get it. You know, there, there is

568
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:50,805
A God, there is a plan.

569
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,365
I'm on A path. Yeah.

570
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:55,165
I mean, that's, that's, that's, yeah.

571
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:57,805
That's, that's what it's about. I guess. You know,

572
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:01,005
Can I, you know, my, my publicist is on the other line.

573
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,045
Can, can I put you on hold for 45 minutes?

574
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,445
Why don't, why don't you just call me back?

575
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:08,245
I'd really rather put you on hold for 45 minutes.

576
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:11,325
Well, I don't think my, my cell phone will last that long.

577
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:14,285
Okay? If I feel angry and disappointed,

578
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:18,325
but I will call you back after my water karate class.

579
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:24,085
So, Sarah, I'm, you know, spiritually centered, you know,

580
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:26,485
I have some philosophy with which to guide me.

581
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:29,685
And you're in this ruling retail vortex of target

582
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,525
beneath the, you know, fluorescent lights and,

583
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:35,645
and you don't have anything, you know, pushing forward,

584
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:37,925
you know, pushing you forward from it.

585
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:40,605
Uhhuh Maria, where's your cart?

586
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:44,485
I'm not, I'm not getting anything. I don't need a cart.

587
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,885
Dude, if you get a cart, mom won't buy you s**t. Get a cart.

588
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:56,485
Sarah. Maria. So Maria,

589
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:58,765
where's your cart, mom?

590
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:00,205
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna get anything.

591
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:04,365
Maria, don't be a martyr. Get a cart.

592
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:08,925
So listen, kiddo, Sarah, why don't you go fill up,

593
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,045
fill up the whole cart with giant Coke.

594
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:13,645
You know what? Why don't you add two carts

595
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,845
and make a wagon train and just fill it.

596
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:20,525
Just fill it. Listen sweetie,

597
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,645
you see, look at this.

598
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:23,485
This is darling. Look at this.

599
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,965
It's a pair of coots with a matching stationary set.

600
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:31,125
Maria, look at that. You're getting it. You're getting it.

601
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,805
So listen, sweetie, you see him down?

602
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:38,885
You seem, you seem depressed. This is fun. Look at this.

603
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:43,125
It's like a picture frame, but it spins.

604
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:46,245
So you see the picture and you see it over.

605
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:50,925
Did you see that? Honey,

606
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:58,605
sweetie, you're getting it.

607
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:02,085
Listen, can I just please,

608
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,005
so listen, look at this.

609
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,605
Oh, okay,

610
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,565
okay. You know,

611
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:11,925
It's like I Told you.

612
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:16,165
Look at these baby babies, sweetie. They're on sale.

613
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:18,965
They're mom. Those were probably made

614
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:20,925
by like a 5-year-old in Guatemala.

615
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:24,605
Well, they certainly weren't supervised

616
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:28,685
'cause they are not made that well, I mean,

617
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:30,885
these kids are not working that hard, huh?

618
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:36,805
Okay. What you do is you get six penguins

619
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:38,565
and six kangaroos.

620
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:42,285
Next time you go to Australia, you got gifts to bring back.

621
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:45,765
You think ahead, honey, let's get six of each. Think ahead.

622
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:49,445
Think ahead. So Liz, I told you, you know, if you wanted

623
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,485
to be in show business, you're gonna have

624
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:54,925
to prepare yourself for a life of rejection.

625
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:58,965
And if you do finally make it via the casting couch,

626
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:03,565
or lady luck, soon enough, your beauty will fade away.

627
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:07,445
And with it, your false friends leaving only the glow

628
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,205
of stardust memories to keep you warm as you

629
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,125
lay in the gutter or the boulevard of dreams.

630
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:20,245
But you are a star, honey, you're a star.

631
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:24,525
We walk down these aisles and people say, who's that?

632
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:28,005
Who, who's that? Uh, that's because you're yelling at me.

633
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:32,285
Mother, sweetie. Mom, mom, mom. Yes.

634
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:36,725
Sarah, mom. Am I a star too? Am I a star?

635
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,685
Yes, of course you are a star, sir.

636
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,525
You are a different kind of star though.

637
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:44,405
You are a pathology star.

638
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:47,885
People look at you and they think science.

639
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:52,565
So listen, I'm gonna break into a run here

640
00:33:52,745 --> 00:33:53,805
and get a fun island,

641
00:33:53,905 --> 00:33:56,285
but I'll meet you at the checkout register in town.

642
00:33:56,555 --> 00:34:01,205
Okay? Hey, Maria.

643
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:06,245
Maria, what do, do you think I'm,

644
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:07,765
you know, like, do you think I could be on tv?

645
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:10,045
Do you think I I I could be on tv.

646
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:15,125
Yeah, anybody can be on tv. Okay. Okay.

647
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,925
So here's my idea for a show. Okay?

648
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:19,685
It's like, it's like a cooking show where you have like,

649
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:21,405
you know, you can see what they're doing, right?

650
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:22,765
With the mirrors and stuff. And,

651
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,285
but then it's like autopsies

652
00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:26,645
and it's like celebrity auto autopsy.

653
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:29,165
So you have like Charlton Heston movie,

654
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:30,605
and then you take a clip and then you go

655
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:32,085
and here's his liver,

656
00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:34,495
Right?

657
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:38,085
That's, that's an incredible idea, Sarah.

658
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,565
That's really, that's really, okay, so, right.

659
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:42,765
Okay, so here's another one coming at you.

660
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:45,565
So, um, I'm doing like, it's like a diet plan that,

661
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:46,685
you know, people go crazy for.

662
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,165
It's like, you can have whatever you want,

663
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:50,965
whatever you want, but it has to be out

664
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,405
of dollhouse furniture.

665
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:56,525
So like, you can have like,

666
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:59,805
you can have like a hot fudge sundae,

667
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:02,565
but it has to be out of like a dollhouse tub.

668
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,485
So, right. So like, you can have like a,

669
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:11,565
like you can have like a sirloin steak, right?

670
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:16,365
But it's gotta be a dollhouse sized steak. Get it?

671
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,405
That's, that's, that's a great, okay,

672
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:20,925
here's my, this is the awesome idea.

673
00:35:21,105 --> 00:35:23,685
So me and my friend Suzy, we okay, we,

674
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:24,725
it's like a home makeover.

675
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:26,165
Shush. We come to your house, right?

676
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,605
We come to your house and um,

677
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,925
we just tell you everything's wrong with your life, right?

678
00:35:30,015 --> 00:35:32,565
Everything that's wrong, we just go, this sucks.

679
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:35,205
And you need a new haircut. And like, just all that stuff.

680
00:35:35,205 --> 00:35:36,285
We just say everything's wrong.

681
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:39,645
Um, like with your kids and like your looks stuff, it's,

682
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:41,365
and then we just leave them there

683
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:46,405
and we don't tell 'em or help 'em how to fix it.

684
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:55,285
That's a really good idea. That's, that's, that's good.

685
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:57,605
Hey Sue, how dad's doing? Okay, right?

686
00:35:57,665 --> 00:35:59,765
He, uh, he's doing okay, right?

687
00:35:59,965 --> 00:36:01,885
'cause uh, I mean he just, the prostate surgery,

688
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:03,325
so he seems really good.

689
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:09,405
I don't know, maybe he's got two ears or something.

690
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:14,005
What? I dunno.

691
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,765
No, this is why we can't talk about this s**t with you, is

692
00:36:18,765 --> 00:36:20,285
because you can't handle it.

693
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:25,165
You freak out. Well, so his dad, I mean his dad,

694
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:26,805
he's gonna die or something.

695
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:31,605
No, I'm just saying, any of us could die at any moment.

696
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:35,765
Like right now, I could have an aneurysm. Oh. Oh, I'm gone.

697
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,085
See what I'm saying? Like, you, you drink so much diet Coke,

698
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:41,845
you could have like a calcified tumor growing diet coke like

699
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:43,165
in your shoulder or something.

700
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,925
I don't know. We're all gonna die, Maria.

701
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:50,845
We're all gonna die. But dad's, but dad's fine, right?

702
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,525
Yeah, he's stole.

703
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:54,005
He's probably gonna last forever, like,

704
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:55,165
you know, 50 more years.

705
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:57,605
But I'm just saying we will die.

706
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:03,325
I know that. Okay.

707
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,965
Hey, do you remember Christie C***s from high school?

708
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:11,245
You mean my, my arch enemy?

709
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,445
Uhhuh Mom's checking out with her at the register right now,

710
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:17,045
and you are gonna die.

711
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:23,605
Hello? Christie. C***s. Wow. What a surprise.

712
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:27,245
No, you were in Maria's class, right? Okay. Okay.

713
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:29,925
Marilyn Banford. Listen, listen.

714
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:31,805
So I love what you've done with your hair,

715
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,565
with the bla the dark root

716
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:36,525
and then the, the the perm and then the blonde.

717
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:42,125
That's fun. That is fun. Listen, are you singing?

718
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:43,725
Are you singing now? Are you,

719
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:45,405
because you were such, such a lovely voice.

720
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:50,245
No, no, no, you're not. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. That's hard.

721
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:52,405
That's hard. That's hard. Well, listen.

722
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:55,725
Uh, Sarah of course, is my older daughter

723
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:58,085
and she is a doctor and her husband's a doctor

724
00:37:58,105 --> 00:37:59,445
and they have four beautiful children

725
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:01,045
and they live on the east side of town.

726
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,165
And they're just, you know, going gangbusters.

727
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:09,645
And then Maria is who's hiding behind the Shrek two DVDs.

728
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:12,725
Maria, she is a comedian

729
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:17,285
and she has been on Conan O'Brien in 1997,

730
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:19,845
which, you know, she was only on there twice.

731
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,125
And then they said never again.

732
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,245
I mean, they didn't say that, but that's how she felt.

733
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:28,565
You know? And it's like she just keeps putting herself out

734
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:29,845
there and you just keep trying.

735
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:31,765
Listen, I am in a real hurry here

736
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:33,685
'cause we gotta go to the Blackberry Indian Casino.

737
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:35,565
We got reservations out there.

738
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,205
So I'm just gonna slide my card

739
00:38:37,205 --> 00:38:39,245
and the other, the girls can sign for it.

740
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:41,965
But good to see you, Christy. Good to see you.

741
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:46,685
Good to see you. Hey, Christy.

742
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:51,005
Yeah, I got four carts, about 20 a piece. Uh, diet Coke.

743
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:54,845
Hey, uh, listen, I gotta go because I got four kids

744
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:59,005
and you know how it is, but, uh, good to see you. Oh

745
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,685
My God, You're gonna die.

746
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:08,125
Uh, hey Christie. Hey, how, how, how?

747
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:11,845
Congratulations. I was, I mean,

749
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:17,245
but, uh, uh, uh, you got married, uh, to Todd.

750
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:20,325
So, uh, anyways, ations and stuff.

751
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:23,525
And, uh, we got divorced.

752
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,375
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

753
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:29,295
I mean, or you know, I mean, whatever is is appropriate,

754
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:33,535
you know, or what, uh, uh, I'm so, um,

755
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:38,095
uh, so he brought over your video, Todd

756
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:39,935
to watch the kids or something?

757
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:43,295
I don't know what it was, but, oh my God, that's so nice.

758
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:48,695
Oh, oh wow. It is just like in high school.

759
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,415
It's like, you are not funny. You're just weird.

760
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:58,895
Well, you know, comedy is subjective, you know, it's, it's,

761
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:00,735
it's, it's an art form, you know?

762
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:03,645
So, uh, so are you gay?

763
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:06,085
'cause I hear like a lot of women comedians are gay.

764
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:10,365
No, no, no, I'm not.

765
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:14,845
I mean, it'd be okay if I was, uh, not okay.

766
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:18,685
If I, if I was, uh, that's great.

767
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:21,125
'cause I remember, um, remember we, I all went

768
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,365
to Christian Bible camp and you went, um,

769
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:24,805
we all went skinny dipping,

770
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:26,685
and you went take your shirt off.

771
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:29,645
And I'm like, oh my God, you got nothing to show anyway.

772
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:32,245
And then you, you took your shirt off

773
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:33,565
and me all gave you t***y, twisters.

774
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:36,125
I was like, oh my God, if you're a lesbian,

775
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:38,445
you'd have been all turned on by that.

776
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:40,325
And I just got all grossed out.

777
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:49,045
Press D or credit.

778
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:54,205
Well that, that's a, that's a horrible memory. My gosh.

779
00:40:56,595 --> 00:40:58,165
It's like, you think you're such a big deal,

780
00:40:58,265 --> 00:41:00,165
but people, you know, people make fun of you.

781
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:03,085
Like Patterson is that he is a, he is a bar.

782
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,885
Like, um, I don't know if I can do,

783
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:08,005
if he doesn't impersonation me.

784
00:41:08,005 --> 00:41:09,485
It's so funny. He goes, uh,

785
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:10,925
he goes, I don't know how you can do it.

786
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:14,285
He goes, hi Maria or something.

787
00:41:14,865 --> 00:41:18,965
And then, um, Mike should ski.

788
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:20,725
He goes, he's so funny.

789
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,965
He goes, he said, he said, I wouldn't have f****d

790
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,765
that freaking high school and I wouldn't f**k her.

791
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:24,965
Now,

792
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:36,525
uh, Christy, why don't,

793
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:38,125
why don't you go suck it?

794
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,125
Why don't you go suck it?

795
00:41:44,395 --> 00:41:47,605
F**k you, f**k you too.

796
00:41:50,305 --> 00:41:52,365
Do you need any help out the car with your bags?

797
00:42:03,705 --> 00:42:08,085
So, uh, this, this is the point

798
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:10,925
where you start to think to yourself, Hey, maybe, you know,

799
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:13,005
maybe, maybe, you know, when you try to think, oh, well,

800
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:14,685
things that, you know, almost change inside yourself

801
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:15,725
and you feel better about yourself.

802
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:17,605
Or maybe, you know, maybe you should, you know,

803
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:19,485
maybe you don't need anybody you know, you don't need,

804
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:21,005
or you know, you don't even need, you know,

805
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,405
'cause I, you know, you're just kind

806
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:23,485
of freaking out or whatever.

807
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:25,765
You just feel kind of like, you kind of, you know, like,

808
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:28,005
okay, this isn't good.

809
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,525
And uh, and then, and then,

810
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:34,725
and then Dustin Hoffman is Rainman.

811
00:42:34,865 --> 00:42:38,045
Dustin Hoffman. Rainman. Hey, we got a table.

812
00:42:38,465 --> 00:42:40,005
We got a table at the Black Bear.

813
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:41,125
Do you wanna come in and sit down?

814
00:42:41,245 --> 00:42:42,565
I don't know what you're doing. You're talking to yourself.

815
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:46,325
Okay, great. Um, we're ready to order. Yeah.

816
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:48,365
Um, I, hi.

817
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:51,005

818
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,285
Okay. Just over here.

819
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,045
I don't know what these other people want. Okay.

00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:56,645
Um, so we're gonna have the cheese pizza

821
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:58,445
and then, um, orange juice

822
00:42:58,465 --> 00:43:00,845
and um, yeah, that's what you're getting.

823
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:04,485
And then, um, my husband wants the surf and turf.

824
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,245
Well, that's what you said you wanted.

825
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:08,645
Well, I dunno what you want.

00:44:42,065 --> 00:44:46,565
People don't listen. Hi,

854
00:44:46,825 --> 00:44:48,045
I'm Marilyn Bamford.

855
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:51,085
And listen, let's just start out with

856
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,005
two pictures of Diet Coke.

857
00:44:53,545 --> 00:44:56,405
And listen, Tina, oh God.

858
00:44:56,645 --> 00:44:58,125
I hate to shoot the messenger,

859
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:01,765
but Diet Pepsi is not okay.

860
00:45:02,745 --> 00:45:05,805
No, it is not. And I know you aren't making these decisions.

861
00:45:05,805 --> 00:45:08,245
It's the big wigs upstairs. Am I right? Yeah.

862
00:45:08,745 --> 00:45:10,285
And it's like they just, you know,

863
00:45:10,455 --> 00:45:11,925
there is a big difference.

864
00:45:12,305 --> 00:45:15,645
And I'm just trying to protest here at the grassroots level

865
00:45:15,825 --> 00:45:20,365
and kind of shift the paradigm, you know, person by person.

866
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:22,925
But Dye Pepsi's fine. That's fine.

867
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:27,645
And, uh, I am on a combination of the South Beach

868
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,645
and Weight Watchers and

869
00:45:29,665 --> 00:45:32,125
so I have six points left and a fruit.

870
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:35,925
And uh, so what, what can I do? What can I do here?

871
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:40,045
What can I do about a French fry or a curly fry?

872
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:41,965
Listen, I, a curly,

873
00:45:42,845 --> 00:45:45,485
I think a curly has more fiber, don't you Tina?

874
00:45:45,715 --> 00:45:47,765
Yeah. Yeah, let's go with that.

875
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:50,085
And then I need to have the fruit.

876
00:45:50,185 --> 00:45:54,565
And that needs to be a fresh, a Raman. A Raman.

877
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:58,045
Isn't that what you use in the industry? Raman?

878
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:03,045
A fresh raspberries. Okay. And uh, you don't have that.

879
00:46:03,355 --> 00:46:05,365
What would you have That would be the equivalent?

880
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:10,005
Strawberry pie. Strawberry pie. That's fine. That's fine.

881
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:13,005
Listen, this is my daughter Maria,

882
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:15,365
if you didn't recognize her already.

883
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:19,085
'cause she has been on the late, late,

884
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:21,285
late late show, honey.

885
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:24,605
Which, what is it? Is it the Late late show

886
00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:26,525
or is it the late, late late show?

887
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:30,485
Or is it, or is it the late? Just the late?

888
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:34,405
No, no, it's the late, late mother. It, it's okay.

889
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:35,845
I don't, I don't think she needs to know.

890
00:46:35,985 --> 00:46:38,565
She doesn't need to know how poorly my career is going.

891
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:41,845
Um, I I I like to have the Chicken Caesar salad

892
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,605
and a Diet Pepsi and thank you so much.

893
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:46,325
You know, thank you so much for, for helping my family.

894
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,125
Thank, thank you. Thank, thank you.

895
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:57,205
Hey, you guys, um, I have a, a announcement to make.

896
00:46:57,665 --> 00:46:59,485
Oh, you're not just gonna have to wait

897
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:01,525
because I have an awesome story.

898
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:05,485
So, um, I'm doing this autopsy, right?

899
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:06,925
That's not even the story.

900
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:09,165
So Steve comes in from down the hall,

901
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:10,845
he is doing like laser surgery, right?

902
00:47:10,845 --> 00:47:13,085
Like burning flesh. Burning flesh, right?

903
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:14,725
And it's right lunchtime.

904
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:17,805
And it's like, he comes in, he is like, oh my God, I had

905
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:19,365
to get outta there 'cause I'm so hungry.

906
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:24,405
And it smells like a barbecue Because

907
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:25,565
we're just meat.

908
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,005
You guys

909
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:30,645
just meat.

910
00:47:34,045 --> 00:47:38,085
I probably taste pretty good. I have a high fat content.

911
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,405
Maria wouldn't taste pretty good. She tastes like

912
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:41,725
diet Coke jerky.

913
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:47,805
Okay, tell your story, Maria. Try and top that.

914
00:47:50,315 --> 00:47:52,405
Okay? Uh, it's not, it's just an announcement.

915
00:47:52,505 --> 00:47:54,165
Um, I just, I've been thinking about it

916
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:56,405
and, you know, I wanted to, you know, do a sitcom

917
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:58,565
or whatever and do, you know, show business stuff.

918
00:47:58,665 --> 00:48:00,125
And I realized, you know, that I don't,

919
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:01,965
I just wanna live in a sitcom, you know, where you have,

920
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:03,845
you know, experiences with people you love and,

921
00:48:03,865 --> 00:48:05,405
and they're funny or, or not funny.

922
00:48:05,985 --> 00:48:07,845
And then, uh, you don't have to act them out.

923
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:10,245
And, uh, so anyways, I'm moving home.

924
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,845
I'm gonna move home, home to Duluth.

925
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:16,645
So I just wanted to, uh, let you do. So I'm excited.

926
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:20,085
And, uh, and so, okay,

927
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:29,435
Marie, do you think you're gonna be avoiding, uh, pain

928
00:48:29,775 --> 00:48:32,035
and rejection by moving to Duluth?

929
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:36,475
You got another thing coming? All right, mark. Am I right?

930
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,355
Okay. I was crabby for about two years, okay?

931
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:41,995
And, um, because I had Josephine

932
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:44,995
and, um, I had, you know how they say you get after kiss?

933
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:47,755
Okay? And they say they're like this small nudes,

934
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,355
the size of apples,

935
00:48:49,895 --> 00:48:51,235
The size of apples.

936
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:53,715
And the only way to get rid

937
00:48:53,715 --> 00:48:55,275
of those things is you gotta time off

938
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:57,155
with a rubber band until they burst.

939
00:48:57,785 --> 00:49:01,435
Okay? And not like a medical rubber band, just a regular

940
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:02,515
Rubber band.

941
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:07,475
So don't tell me about pain and humiliation. Okay?

942
00:49:10,255 --> 00:49:11,395
Me, you Know, it's right.

943
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,915
You know, it's tough all over. You know, my job, I, uh,

944
00:49:15,135 --> 00:49:16,835
You know, I got written up at my job

945
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:18,475
as patient came in, you know,

946
00:49:18,475 --> 00:49:21,315
and they wrote a letter complaining, you know, they said,

947
00:49:21,695 --> 00:49:23,355
uh, I think Dr. Manford

948
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:26,275
A you know, I think Dr.

949
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:27,535
Ba,

950
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:31,395
I know what she said. You know, she

951
00:49:31,395 --> 00:49:33,075
said, uh, I, I think Dr.

952
00:49:33,105 --> 00:49:34,555
Manford said a little,

953
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:39,595
Okay, Okay.

954
00:49:39,795 --> 00:49:40,795
Crazy

955
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:47,755
Marie, Sweetie.

956
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:52,195
Oh God, you can't move home, honey.

957
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,435
You, you are not welcome at home.

958
00:49:57,455 --> 00:50:02,035
And I say this because you, I wasn't gonna tell you this,

959
00:50:02,095 --> 00:50:03,995
but we were having a prayer vigil.

960
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:07,715
Uh, Benny Silver Dean was, uh, dying of breast cancer.

961
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:11,435
And we had a, a prayer vigil around it,

962
00:50:11,435 --> 00:50:13,515
and we kind of, we were there for a couple hours.

963
00:50:13,535 --> 00:50:15,115
We kind of ran outta things to pray for.

964
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:19,595
And, uh, I says, I says, let's pray that Maria

965
00:50:20,665 --> 00:50:24,555
gets it a sitcom and a husband.

966
00:50:27,105 --> 00:50:29,245
And I just think, I know you don't believe in him,

967
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:33,725
but Jesus wants you to have, you know,

968
00:50:34,805 --> 00:50:39,645
a MySpace page and a, and, and, and, and merch.

969
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:41,565
And he wants you to.

970
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:47,485
He just how you can't move home, mom, don't wor don't worry.

971
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:49,845
It's you guys. It's, it's a, I'm act. I'm act.

972
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:52,365
I mean, it's just, I'm not actually moving home.

973
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:53,605
It's just a, it's just a show.

974
00:50:54,025 --> 00:50:55,365
So there's, there's people here.

975
00:50:55,365 --> 00:50:58,365
It's, it's just a, it is just a show. It's just a show.

976
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:04,725
Oh my God. Oh, that's funny. Okay, I get it.

977
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:08,285
I get it. I get it. I get it. Funny, funny, funny, funny.

978
00:51:08,795 --> 00:51:12,085
Okay. Maria exaggerates so much of this is not true.

979
00:51:12,995 --> 00:51:16,765
It's true on an emotional level,

980
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,605
perhaps, but in no way.

981
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:22,805
It's more of a are we gonna be on tv?

982
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,485
Does is this mean we're gonna be on tv?

983
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:26,845
Well, no, it's just, it's kind of in my head right now,

984
00:51:26,985 --> 00:51:29,245
now just doing it in theater, right?

985
00:51:29,465 --> 00:51:30,805
That's, that's pretty good, right?

986
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:33,365
Maybe if you put my, your hands like this,

987
00:51:33,395 --> 00:51:34,725
it'd be kind of like I'm on tv.

988
00:51:35,435 --> 00:51:37,565
Like, yeah, you should, you should put it, you should put,

989
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,045
it's just, oh s**t about me dying.

990
00:51:42,785 --> 00:51:45,685
No death. See, that's the thing in the show is

991
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,565
that no one ever dies.

992
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:52,805
Oh, okay. Yeah. I wanna be in every episode.

993
00:51:55,815 --> 00:51:59,325
Maria, this amazing show. It's brilliant. You're fantastic.

994
00:51:59,555 --> 00:52:01,445
This is amazing. This is a breakthrough.

995
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:04,365
And we need to recast you.

996
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,685
You can't, you can't recast Maria.

997
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:11,845
I, I don't wanna be in your show, so don't put me in it.

998
00:52:13,445 --> 00:52:15,085
I don't want you to be in my show.

999
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:17,405
So why don't you go to hell in a hand basket?

1000
00:52:18,905 --> 00:52:22,605
Why don't you go suck it? Why don't you f**k off?

1001
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:25,325
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls.

1002
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,725
Listen honey, the reason,

1003
00:52:27,905 --> 00:52:30,725
and Christie is so hostile is

1004
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:33,525
because she wants, she just, she's just jealous, honey.

1005
00:52:33,785 --> 00:52:36,365
And she, why, why don't you give her a part in the show,

1006
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,565
honey, why don't you give Christie a part in

1007
00:52:39,565 --> 00:52:40,605
your sitcom, mom?

1008
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:44,565
It's just basically in my, oh my God, Maria,

1009
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:47,125
am I gonna be on job?

1010
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:50,205
This is so funny. I get that.

1011
00:52:50,995 --> 00:52:53,805
Okay, you're gonna be in, put little parts of the show.

1012
00:52:53,915 --> 00:52:57,085
Just little parts. Not, not the whole, okay. Okay.

1013
00:52:57,365 --> 00:52:59,725
I Little parts, I'll just be a little parts,

1014
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:02,565
little parts of your show.

1015
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:08,485
So Maria, I wanna introduce you to somebody.

1016
00:53:08,805 --> 00:53:13,725
I wanna introduce you. My God, Maria, I'm so sorry.

1017
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:17,525
Um, they, I didn't wanna act anymore

1018
00:53:17,985 --> 00:53:21,125
and um, I didn't even audition for the sitcom in your head,

1019
00:53:22,585 --> 00:53:24,965
but I, I got the part.

1020
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:30,125

I'm not knowing what to do.

1057
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,565
I know what's written wrong since I've been 10.

1058
00:55:47,285 --> 00:55:50,365
I hear a lot of stories

1059
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:55,365
and I reckon are true about

1060
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,445
how girls are put upon by men.

1061
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:04,565
I know I must have fallen into the pet,

1062
00:56:06,385 --> 00:56:09,605
but when I am with, uh, Fowler, I forget.

1063
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:13,645

Are you like, are you gonna keep talking?

1072
00:56:37,015 --> 00:56:38,115
That's it. That's it.

1073
00:56:38,935 --> 00:56:40,195
I'm just a girl.

1074
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:45,435
I can't say no, I'm in a terrible fact.

1075
00:56:47,035 --> 00:56:51,035
I always say, come on, let's go. Just win.

1076
00:56:51,395 --> 00:56:53,515
I gotta seat next. Shut up.

1077
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:58,515
I, uh, the girls, I mean,

1078
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:01,915
girls are so co and sweet,

1079
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,795
but other girls ain't having any fun.

1080
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:09,635
Every time I lose a RA match,

1081
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,675
I have a money feeling that I want.

1082
00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:17,035
I'm gonna suffer. Lights are low.

1083
00:57:17,795 --> 00:57:21,715
I can't be pri and queen. That is

1084
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:36,355
No,

1085
00:58:03,405 --> 00:58:06,065
Uh, this is the Duluth AEL lift bridge used to be able

1086
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,705
to go up with the wi with, with the bridge,

1087
00:58:09,005 --> 00:58:12,585
but now you can't because then one year somebody jumped off

1088
00:58:13,005 --> 00:58:16,145
and they got caught up in all the P pulleys and the weights

1089
00:58:16,365 --> 00:58:21,185
and they got sliced right in half, right in half.

1090
00:58:23,355 --> 00:58:27,145
Which is, I mean, that's, that's a good way

1091
00:58:27,145 --> 00:58:28,385
to go really.

1092
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,785
But it might have inspired copycat.

1093
00:58:33,565 --> 00:58:33,785
Um,

1094
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,585
that's, that's about it.

1095
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:03,695
A cash

1096
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:18,535
I run.
