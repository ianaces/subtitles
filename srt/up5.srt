things right like I started working out

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
and then I quit doing that cuz that

26
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,280
sucked uh but one of the things I did is

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,080
I decided that uh I was going to cut out

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,960
fast food and like you know and soda and

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,640
all that right and so it's funny cuz I I

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,520
was able to cut out the soda or pop or

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,799
whatever and the fast food I was able to

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:30,600

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,799
Wendy spicy chicken sandwich

and I am born and raised in Minnesota so

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,280

364
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,240
the light road tracks and there was a

365
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,839
black lives matter protest going on it

366
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,160
was all white people protesting but

367
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,959
everybody in the stadium was looking at

368
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,120
me like I did it like this is [ __ ]

369
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
annoying like

370
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,199
I and I live in this new gentrified

371
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,959
neighborhood where everybody puts black

372
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,600
lives matter signs in their yards so now

373
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,959
I know where all the white people

374
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,639
live so I started stealing them the

375
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,800
signs not white people like in during

376
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,079
the election season I would take black

377
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,600
lives matter sign and put it in a trump

378
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:50,519
yard and just sit in the bushes and just

379
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,519
watching I feel like black lives matter

380
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,800
is doing it wrong instead of throwing

381
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,360
protest they should throw parades cuz

382
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,680
you can't get mad at a parade if you get

383
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,279
mad at a parade a place of throwing

384
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,199
candy out of a slow moving vehicle

385
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,519
you're the [ __ ] it's you like it's

386
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,399
candy out of a vehicle like you they can

387
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,160
also subtly slip in their message they

388
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:09,320
throw candy out and just throw Jolly

389
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,320
ranch or lollipops but the only Flav is

390
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,560
watermelon I do uh I do like being

391
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,199

395
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,839

bit an older parent you know and I was

398
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,600

399
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,839
he was like well what if she gets lonely

400
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,199
and I started thinking about that I was

401
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,199
like you know what that is her [ __ ]

402
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,920

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,720
if a lot of you guys have kids or not I

409
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,440
you know so I was you know in my late

410
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,560
30s when my wife got pregnant and so was

411
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,440
a whole new world I didn't know anything

412
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,600
about it concept of it my wife was very

413
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,839
gassy during the pregnancy which I

414
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,880
didn't know was a side effect of being

415
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,880
pregnant this lady knows what I'm

416
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,279
talking talking about this guy didn't

417
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,199
Goa at that but yeah it is weird it's

418
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,839
like disturbing how gassy and my wife

419
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:10,720
was like hey it's totally natural for

420
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,759
pregnant women to pass this much gas I

421
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,920
was like really is it natural for them

422
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,199
to be holding their husband's heads

423
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,320
under the covers while they're doing it

424
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,519

everyone you saw so

440
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,399
far it's a tough world to raise children

441
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,319
in everywhere you look kids for the most

442
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,680
part turning out to be spoiled little

443
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,600
punks it's kid on my Street's 8 years

444
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,040
old last Christmas his parents bought

445
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,639
him an iPhone my six-year-old sees this

446
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,600
he's like Daddy why can't we have stuff

447
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,800
like that I don't want you to be that

448
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,880
kid in two years that kid's eight he

449
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,199
sucks already he's got a neck tattoo and

450
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,560
two failed

451
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,680
marriages cuz his parents just green

452
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,399
light whatever trying to put some effort

453
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,360
into this Christmas is a good example of

454
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,600
something we're doing ourselves to

455
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,839
instill the wrong principle in our kids

456
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,680
cuz we have not updated these traditions

457
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,880
we just pass them down lazily from

458
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,920
generation to generation like they still

459
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,160
make sense and they might have made

460
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,040
sense back when rocking horse was a top

461
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,759
five

462
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,720
gift but it's not anymore yeah we still

463
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,399
tell our kids hey write the top four or

464
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,959
five things you want down on a piece of

465
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,279
paper we're going to send that list away

466
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,959
to Santa which means now I got to give

467
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,120
credit for the most expensive most

468
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,959
competitive gifts to buy that particular

469
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,959
season to a guy that does not exist for

470
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,520
a lie I did not

471
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,559
start how's that fair to Dad when you

472
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,280
work your ass off all year long but you

473
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,760
only take credit for gifts like 6

474
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,199
through 11 and now some stranger you

475
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,600
meet at the mall once a year bought you

476
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,880
the good stuff I got you socks to school

477
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,039
supplies that's why I tweak things at an

478
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,000
early age I told my boys hey guys

479
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,839
remember Christmas is coming up which

480
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,640
means Mommy and Daddy are going to buy

481
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,520
you a lot of gifts cuz we think you've

482
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,000
been really nice this

483
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,720
year but don't forget Santa's going to

484
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,600
come visit us on Christmas Eve and

485
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,039
depending on how good or bad you

486
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,080
actually were he's going to take as many

487
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,480
presents as he sees

488
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,240
fit so hope you were good boys when no

489
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,000
one was watching cuz he always is night

490
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
night

491
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Traditions that makes more sense now you

492
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,919
have Santa working for you not against

493
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,280
you now when they throw a tantrum on

494
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,760
Christmas morning I asked for a Star

495
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,480
Wars robot why isn't there a robot you

496
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,960
don't have to be a bad guy or explain

497
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,200
lay

498
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,850
away you just jump on board what I

499
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,840
bought you a robot it should be

500
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,120
[Music]

501
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,600
right that's probably one of the gifts

502
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,600
Santa

503
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,600
took you know how hard that was for me

504
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,600
to buy for you what did you

505
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,640
do now I'm pissed off you owe me a

506
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,880
robot they're going to be appreciative

507
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,880
for every other gift under that

508
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,600
tree seems mean but it works out better

509
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,120
for the kids too cuz now when they're

510
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,919
like seven or eight years old some bully

511
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,840
convinces them saying it isn't real

512
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,760
instead of being devastated they're like

513
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,120
oh thank

514
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,520
god dude that guy's been jacking me for

515
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,320
years that's a happy day all of a sudden

516
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,640
we're lying the right direction away

517
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,640
from therapy

518
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,720
was working so well I started

519
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,440
incorporating the same philosophy some

520
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,760
other aspects of parenting a while back

521
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
one of my kids was being a real

522
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,200
knowitall wouldn't listen to me when I

523
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,400
tried to impart

524
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,480
wisdom incidentally around that same

525
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,720
time he lost his first tooth I recognize

526
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,919
that as a teaching

527
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:28,960
opportunity I was like oh

528
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,960
[ __ ] dude that is not supposed to happen

529
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,000
I told you to brush those every

530
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,200
day you skipped once didn't you it's all

531
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,440
takes one

532
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,159
time going to listen to Daddy when he

533
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,280
tries to teach you stuff from now on

534
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,799

to hear

539
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,000
you all right listen there's something

540
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,600
you can do to try to fix this but you

541
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,360
did not hear this from me

542
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:09,000

543
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,400
you go to sleep you got to leave at

544
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,679
least a dollar under your

545
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,720
pillow for the tooth fairy and maybe

546
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,840
she'll let that [ __ ] grow

547
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,360
back it's probably not going to be nice

548
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,679
and straight like your last one but

549
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,720
that's on

550
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,760
you it's just going to be a constant

551
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,640
crooked reminder of how smart your daddy

552
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,640
is

553
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,799
he's not going to be happy with that

554
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,559
information he's going to brush those

555
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,159
teeth every night till they're all gone

556
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,960
by the time he realizes that's normal

557
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,760
you got 30 something dollars saved up

558
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,280
towards his future dental work that's

559
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,159
not a shitty kid like the kid down the

560
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,360
street that's a great kid shipping in

561
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,159
for his own braces one day we're here

562
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,080
with Dave Williamson yes sir how are you

563
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,480
doing good man how you good pleasure to

564
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,640
see you real good so let's talk about

565
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,480
your album thicker than water

566
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,520
yeah it's uh one of my favorite records

567
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,600
that I own uh from standup I remember uh

568
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,080
cleaning and pitching in just to get a

569
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,720
copy of of it and uh the thing about it

570
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,720
and I'm sure you get this a lot but for

571
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,080
me my favorite part is easily the ice

572
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,080
cream music like that like it was my

573
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,840
absolute favorite and I remember uh I

574
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,320
listened to it and me and my buddies

575
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,000
were on a road trip it was me and two

576
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,720
other comics and we were going to a gig

577
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,279
and we're listening to it I looked at my

578
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,600
buddies and I said if he does not have a

579
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,200
hidden track with ice cream music this

580
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,919
whole album is [ __ ] yeah and then uh

581
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,520
we got so wrapped up in the rest of it

582
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,559
cuz it's a very good album it's very

583
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,480
funny totally forgot about it and then

584
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,919
it's just running and then just all of a

585
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,360
sudden what was so funny is like it

586
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,240
starts in So Soft right so we're just

587
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,679
driving and I just hear this and I I

588
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,840
literally forgot about I'm looking

589
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,960
around and I'm like is there an ice cre

590
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,600
oh my God [ __ ] it just cranked it rolled

591
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,919
down the windows and like there were no

592
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,720
kids we're in the middle of nowhere but

593
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,840
we're like oh and I've tried to do that

594
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,640
at least twice now to try and like do it

595
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,000
in real life with that that makes me so

596
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,720
happy I mean that was like one of my

597
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
first jokes that like I really like you

598
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,400
know was a staple for me you know and

599
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,039
then uh when I was like you know putting

600
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,480
all my old material together to make my

601
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,000
first album uh you know and I was

602
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,200
talking to Dan um at the label I said

603
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,760
like hey man do you think it'd be cool

604
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,760
if we actually put a a song on there and

605
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
whatever and he was like let me look

606
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,880
into it and he had to buy the rights to

607
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,960
whatever the famous ice cream truck

608
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,600
music song was like KY the Dario or

609
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,360
whatever it is we did and we put it on

610
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,760
there man I mean like the the thing too

611
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,799
that I really like is I really like the

612
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,400
cover like the cover is a really cool

613
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,120
picture and I and I how many shots did

614
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,919
that take you to get that like how how

615
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,400
long were you like at any point did they

616
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,960
have to drag you out of a pool and like

617
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,360
resuscitate you to get another better

618
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,120
shot of it no I mean I was playing to my

619
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,799
skill set there because you know I grew

620
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,400
up in Miami and we'd go uh spear fishing

621
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,960
and and free diving stuff so I mean I

622
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
have really good lung support but uh the

623
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,600
harder part was getting my kids to

624
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,120
swimming around on the background uh for

625
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,480
so long cuz it was actually even though

626
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,600
it's Miami it was still winter when we

627
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,240
shot that oh so the water was cold kids

628
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,600
give you perspective too man I know

629
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,640
that's cliche in itself but it's true

630
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,559
like like I love I love doing this

631
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,799
that's my job man it was always my dream

632
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,320
you know it's what I wanted to be and I

633
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,039
worked hard and I you know I've been

634
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,720
doing it full-time for for a long time

635
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,840
now and everything and you know I'm not

636
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,799
complaining for a second but just like

637
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,360
every job there's like good days and bad

638
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,159
days and recently I was in a little bit

639
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,400
of a funk and I just didn't want to

640
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,120
think about work I just want to like

641
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,640
take my family and go do something and

642
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,120
try to concentrate on what's important

643
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,919
in life you know you ever one of those

644
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,919
days where work just finds you like you

645
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
can't get away from it some of you guys

646
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,679
were like teachers and you're like yeah

647
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,159
we [ __ ] try not to think about kids

648
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,720
and it's all you talk

649
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,720
about no well I went I took my family

650
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,080
hiking and I was on this hiking trail

651
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,200
and I found a Heckler right I could spot

652
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,159
these dudes from a mile away too like

653
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,000
this is what happened my youngest son

654
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,360
got hot while we were hiking so he took

655
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,240
his little Chewbacca sweatshirt off and

656
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,480
he asked me to hold it for him and I

657
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,760
don't want to hike with it in my hand

658
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,960
hand so I put it up over my shoulders

659
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,960
you know like stretched it over my

660
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,440
shoulders and then this dude coming the

661
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,880
other way just looking at me and his

662
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,600
eyes were all lit up and I'm like oh

663
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,919
[ __ ] man I know exactly what this dude's

664
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,400
this type you know and he gets right up

665
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,559
next to me and he looks around see how

666
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,480
loud he's got to be to make sure

667
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,720
everyone can hear him and then he goes

668
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,520
hey

669
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,000
buddy looks like you bought that

670
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,000
sweatshirt a few sizes too

671
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,399
small and he thought he was so

672
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,720
funny and I could have zinged him back

673
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:32,200
and made a joke but then he would have

674
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,480
thought I was enjoying this exchange

675
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,559
probably and it would have encouraged

676
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,000
him you know and then he I would have

677
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,200
done it some dude at Starbucks the next

678
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,760
morning it would done to the guy who

679
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,919
sits next to him at work every day and

680
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,399
this dude would have been a menace to

681
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,120
society for the rest of his life so

682
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:47,200
instead I made a split second decision

683
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,559
to shut this guy down it's really out of

684
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,880
character for me but I looked him in the

685
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,240
face and I go

686
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,760
what no oh no man it's not my sweatshirt

687
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,799
this is my

688
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,360
son's he's been missing for two days now

689
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,440
it's the first clue we

690
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,840
found if you could keep your eyes open

691
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,000
as you're hiking today we would really

692
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,320
appreciate that you know and this dude's

693
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,320
face was like oh

694
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,559
[ __ ] like I don't think he he still

695
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,320
might not have talked to another adult

696
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:18,080
to this day like that's how devastated

697
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,559
this guy looked I thought my family was

698
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,799
going to give away my lie you know like

699
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,960
they're what are you talking about that

700
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,440
but I look over at them and they were

701
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,679
totally unbored my kids were like

702
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,039
looking in bushes for Clues and [ __ ]

703
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,320
like Cory

704
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,640
where are

705
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,120
you we miss you come

706
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,880
[Laughter]

707
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,480
home so this guy couldn't wait to he

708
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,880
hiked away from us turned the corner and

709
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
everything you know and then uh we start

710
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,440
laughing we're having a nice little

711
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,279
family bonding moment everything and my

712
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,799
oldest son gets real serious for a

713
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,760
second and I thought that he was a shame

714
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,559
like what he realized we did was

715
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,399
terrible but turns out it wasn't shame

716
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,720
it was Pride cuz he looks up at me and

717
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:02,240
he goes man

718
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,960
that guy had no idea he was dealing with

719
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
a famous

720
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,559
comedian

721
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,440
right I realized something in that

722
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,120
moment man all this dumb stuff I was

723
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,000
letting get me bummed out that week all

724
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,520
this ridiculous [ __ ] we used to equate

725
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,679
with success like money and fame

726
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,880
whatever like that doesn't matter in

727
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,360
life that's what matters right there

728
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
it's tricking your kids into thinking

729
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,440
you already have that

730
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,120
[ __ ] cuz it felt so good

731
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,200
and it's so much easier than working

732
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,360
hard you know how gullible kids

733
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,840
are now every time I'm feeling a little

734
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,960
bummed out I just throw a YouTube clip

735
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,399
of myself up on Roku on the big screen

736
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,960
I'm like look Daddy's on national TV

737
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:49,080
again like Daddy you're so successful I

738
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,080
know that drives me for another month or

739
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,120
so what are some of the worst rooms

740
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,120
you've done oh

741
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,559
jeez how much time you got as much as

742
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
you need I uh I mean I always feel a

743
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,799
little guilty telling this one story but

744
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,360
it was definitely probably the most I

745
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,679
ever hated being on stage but uh I did a

746
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,399
show in gr Cayman in the in uh down in

747
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,120
the Caribbean you know yeah and I was

748
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:13,880
like so I feel bad like complaining

749
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,159
about going to a beautiful place for

750
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,240
work sounds terrible but it but it was

751
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,840
so bad like so we had to lie on our on

752
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,200
our customs forum and say that we were

753
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,559
there for like uh just for a vacation

754
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,080
it's like me and another comic I'd never

755
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,600
met before so then we go to this bar and

756
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,720
they were trying to do this like comedy

757
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,919
night or something thing and uh it was

758
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,320
like four tourists showed up and like

759
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,880
they had us down on a dance floor and

760
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,720
then the people watching the show or up

761
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,880
higher than us looking down on us and

762
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,720
the DJ was set up off to the side and

763
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,840
every time i' do a joke the DJ would go

764
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,919
like pick P or something like that and I

765
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,360
was like what are you doing dude you're

766
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,039
not helping man you know and it we had

767
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,840
to feel all this like a rim shot but

768
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:56,519
techno version oh so bad so you've got

769
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,679
another album coming out so yes we um we

770
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,200
already recorded it okay we did it on a

771
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,760
in a really cool theater in uh Miami

772
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Beach um it's actually so the Filmore is

773
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:11,200
a very famous um giant theater it's been

774
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,440
there a long time and uh Jackie gleon uh

775
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,120
used to basically it was where he

776
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,919
performed that's like the history behind

777
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,799
was like Jackie Gleason's theater and so

778
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,399
there's a sound stage in the back where

779
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,600
Jackie used to practice for the TV show

780
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,320
and and things like that so um they've

781
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,399
turned the back Sound Stage into like a

782
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,159
little Ballroom so we did it back there

783
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,519
we we shot it as a DVD and a CD so um

784
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,600
we're just working on editing now and

785
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,200
hopefully get it out pretty soon you got

786
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,200
the cover art down we don't man we're

787
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,840
still talking about that the problem is

788
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,760
that we set the bar so high with the

789
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,000
first one that that's really the hard

790
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,559
part is coming up with something that's

791
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,159
going to be equally as cool Dave

792
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,519
Williamson everybody

793
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,519
heyo freeze

794
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,519
frame I did um I did a cool thing uh I

795
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,480
took my family on the road with me

796
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,519
actually for a year and a half like cuz

797
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,320
I was traveling so much I was getting on

798
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,640
airplanes every week and my kids were

799
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,880
more developmental ages at the time and

800
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,679
I didn't want my kids to grow up weird

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,279
because I was being like an absentee Dad

802
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,120
so we sold our house we bought an RV we

803
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,519
started homeschooling them and they came

804
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,600
on tour with us for a year and a half

805
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,679
all right yeah it's kind of cool cuz

806
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,120
that'll make them normal you

807
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,640
know so this is one of my favorite

808
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,519
stories from that trip it was the best

809
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,320
time of my life it was like it ended up

810
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,399
being one of the greatest things ever

811
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,640
and uh this is one of my favorite

812
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:37,720
stories from that trip I was doing a

813
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:41,320
show just outside of Chicago the comedy

814
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,960
club was inside of a resort so they gave

815
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,000
us a really nice hotel suite for the

816
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,120
weekend we parked our RV and we parked

817
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,559
our car in the uh parking lot and just

818
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,159
left it and stayed on premises for the

819
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,480
whole weekend it was cool for a few

820
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,559
reasons one there was posters of me

821
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,120
everywhere which my kids don't usually

822
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,919
get to see so they were like Daddy look

823
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,480
it's you Dave Williamson I'm like I know

824
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,679
it's told you I'm very

825
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,440
successful but even cooler than that was

826
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,559
the pool there cuz it was like super

827
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,600
kid-friendly it was just all parents and

828
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,240
kids they didn't have to worry about

829
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,000
accidentally splashing someone there was

830
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,519
an awesome waterfall that they could

831
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,760
climb on there was a DJ playing top 40

832
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,840
hits felt like MTV Spring break but

833
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,120
several years

834
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,320
later everybody had their mistakes from

835
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,519
spring break with them you know it's

836
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,039
like a reunion

837
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,600
episode so the DJ would stop the music

838
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,440
every 30 minutes or so and she'd call

839
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,240
the kids over to do a little contest for

840
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,919
prizes and stuff and my oldest son like

841
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,840
I said super competitive so he was on

842
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,200
board every time at one point they were

843
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,360
doing a race in the pool they just

844
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
swimmed to the other side of the pool

845
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,519
and back and she had prizes for first

846
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,240
second and third place there was only

847
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:45,679
four kids that were going to race the

848
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,919
other three were much older and bigger

849
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,559
than my son so I knew he was going to

850
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,760
lose you know he was going to be the

851
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,880
only kid that didn't get a prize and I'm

852
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,279
like dude you sure you want to do this

853
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,840
he's like I'm going to do it Dad one of

854
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,120
the other kids even had water wings on

855
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,720
which is [ __ ] right off the bat

856
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,080
there's no integrity this race you know

857
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,880
I'm like all right man all right go for

858
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,600
it and he came in last and he was

859
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,360
already crying by the time he got to the

860
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,200
side of the pool you know and I looked

861
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,919
him in the face and I said listen buddy

862
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,120
it's not always about winning or losing

863
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,919
sometimes you got to just try your

864
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,519
hardest and let that be enough because

865
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,000
when you're a good dad you say [ __ ] you

866
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,840
don't believe all the

867
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,880
time so fast forward to about an hour

868
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,320
later the DJ stops the music again and

869
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,559
she goes all right guys we're going to

870
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,120
do another race in the pool and I have a

871
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,480
great prize for first place and first

872
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,200
place only it's a really good prize but

873
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,159
it's more of an adult prize so I'm going

874
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,200
to need some adults to race in the pool

875
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,679
so my son gets up out of the pool and he

876
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,919
comes racing over to me where I'm

877
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,080
sitting in a lawn chair and he goes

878
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,200
daddy you got a race like he knows he

879
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,720
disgraced our honor and I got to regain

880
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,200
the family's dignity right I was like

881
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,320
dude I don't really feel like racing man

882
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,960
I'm chilling like I'm just going to sit

883
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,320
this out he looks me in the face and he

884
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,480
goes daddy if you're scared don't worry

885
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,320
about it it's not always about winning

886
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,240
or

887
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,639
losing sometimes you got to just try

888
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,679
your hardest and let that be enough said

889
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:08,000
I see what you're doing you little

890
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,519
[ __ ] you want to prize so bad you're

891
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,559
throwing my own words back in my face

892
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,440
all right fair enough I will show you

893
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,240
that it is always important to try now I

894
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,679
tell you this for context not to brag

895
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,440
but I played water polo most my life I

896
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,960
still swim from time to time to keep in

897
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,639
shape I'm not the fastest guy on Earth

898
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,600
but I'm pretty sure I can do all right

899
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:30,679
it's some stupid race in the outskirts

900
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,679
of Chicago for some [ __ ] prize if I

901
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,960
want to is all I'm

902
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:38,039
saying but I decided it would be a

903
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,720
better lesson for my son if I lost and I

904
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,039
was a really good sport about it so that

905
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,440
was my plan as I walked over to the

906
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,480
pool but then I got over

907
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,320
there and there were these two dudes

908
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,679
that were like helping each other

909
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,720
stretch making real aggressive eye

910
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,840
contact with

911
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,840
me and there's this guy over here who's

912
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,200
doing this arm motion like he's

913
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,679
competitively swam before and or seen it

914
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,840
on

915
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,279
TV my competitive juices started flowing

916
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,440
I was like oh all right you little

917
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,519
[ __ ] want to race oh we can race and

918
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,240
I had to stop myself just shy going out

919
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,639
to my car to get my emergency

920
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,080
Speedo cuz I always have

921
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:23,960
one this lady's losing her mind she's

922
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,720
like I got such a good prize for first

923
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,480
place swimmers on your mark get set go

924
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,600
and I shot off that wall

925
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,399
rocketed to the other side of the pool

926
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,320
did a flip turn in like one foot of

927
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,760
water pretty sure I kicked at least one

928
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,600
of those dudes in the rib cage on the

929
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,000
way

930
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,840
back I slapped the side of the pool so

931
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
hard as I finished I hurt my thumb I

932
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,279
whipped my head around as if to check an

933
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,519
imaginary time board in the

934
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:52,919
Olympics and in my brain it definitely

935
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:55,480
said Williamson Phelps right I was

936
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,279
feeling pretty good about myself until I

937
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,600
scanned down and realized

938
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,960
none of the other swimmers had even made

939
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,000
it to the other side of the pool

940
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,320
yet like I put way too much effort into

941
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,839
winning this

942
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,480
race now every single person that was

943
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,560
staying at this Resort had gathered to

944
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,520

945
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,919

950
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,720
earlier you guys saw that

951
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,159

953
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,399
but they were right I toed it up pretty

954
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,240
bad and I had to climb out of the pool

955
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,159
and pretend like I wasn't a douche you
