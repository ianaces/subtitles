1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,480
the priorities in this country are all

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,160
wrong you ever feel that way I feel like

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,599
the only two things we care about

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,559
anymore are recycling and celebrities

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,080
and we've even gone as far as to recycle

6
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,480
our celebrities don't believe me take a

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,160
look at Who's Back Billy Ray Cyrus New

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,920
Kids on the Block Brett Michaels I was

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,080
unimpressed with these [ __ ] first

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,760
brush with Fame why the [ __ ] are we

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,160
giving them a redo oh come on Stanley

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240
Nostalgia can be fun really even when it

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,040
comes to something that sucks look I've

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,879
been kicked in the balls before I'm in

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,520
no hurry to have it done again just for

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,559
the sake of nostalgia but they're back

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,480
and they're performing and they're

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,760
selling out crowds you know what this

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,200
tells me the learning curve never kicked

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,559
in you see people would rather resort to

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,920
something they know because it's

22
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,039
familiar rather than go out and

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,399
experience something new no matter how

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,239
God awful it is it's kind of like the

25
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,960
girl who sleeps with her ex-boyfriend

26
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,000
knowing that he's a fan of the donkey

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,559
punch sure she hates it but there's

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,320
comfort and familiar it and by the way

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,560
what a bunch of unimpressive uninspiring

30
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,759
talentless Apes they are and that's what

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,119
they are overpaid overmarking talentless

32
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,799
Apes period if it were a matter of

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,000
talent Brett Michaels would be playing

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,119
an open mic night in a dive bar in

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Hollywood after working a long shift at

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,439
a car wash would you like Turtle Wax and

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,159
some Armor All on your dash touch my

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,720
dick we get it you know the chords D and

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,799
G you're a musical genius is you want to

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,799
impress me see if you can make a noose

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,920
out of fake hair but women love him they

42
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,759
do Rock of Love those chicks are skanky

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,640
too they are I found out they were

44
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,439
coming to Chicago I immediately threw on

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,479
a rubber and took some penicillin

46
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,159
there's nothing Rock about him you think

47
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,840
Jack White's ever gone tanning I don't

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
think so marketing that's not true

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,960
Stanley we give new performers a chance

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,439
all the time what about American Idol

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,799
those are people we don't know and we

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,159
give them a shot at Fame true but you

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,799
notice they only Sing cover songs so

54
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,759
basically we create new stars out of the

55
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,560
shitty soundtrack of our past what is

56
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,680
this obsession with making everyone an

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
overnight success in this country

58
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,599
America loves an underdog but only when

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,480
it comes in the form of a sports team or

60
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,640
an Entertainer never when it comes down

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,879
to things that actually matter like our

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
policies or your right as an individual

63
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,080
and that's another thing somewhere along

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
the lines this country became one big

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,040
mediocre talent show American Idol

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,760
America's Got Talent America's Next Top

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,920
Model Project Runway Toddlers and Tiaras

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,599
Dancing with the Stars what a [ __ ]

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,560
joke every lunatic with CA teeth and a

70
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,519
dream thinks they're somehow entitled to

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,920
fame and fortune in this country but we

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,920
do it we make them famous then we make

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,560
them Infamous which is my favorite part

74
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,480
did you hear what Miss California said

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,239
about gay marriage no you know why

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,959
wasn't listening sorry but I don't take

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,120
my social cues from someone just just

78
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,480
because they look pretty and a

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,000
convertible on Thanksgiving remember

80
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,840
this intellectual

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,680
Juggernaut and I believe that our

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,480
education like such as in South Africa

83
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,239
and Iraq everywhere like such as Iraq

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,879
everywhere like such as yeah she placed

85
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,159
in the top three in a similar contest

86
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,879
top three weren't you the bell of the

87
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,000
ball I don't listen to beauty pageant

88
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,640
contestants just like I don't call the

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,239
prom queen from my senior years and ask

90
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,680
her which way I should lean when it

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,080
comes to abortion Miss California holy

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,799
[ __ ] that controversy cranked out more

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,959
right-wing nut jobs than Elizabeth

94
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,120
hasselbacks vagina and [ __ ] liberals too

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,560
while I'm at it seriously I don't litter

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,040
and I'm not racist that's all you're

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,360
getting out of me whose side is this guy

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,959
on no one's I've read Animal Farm I have

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,079
a pretty good idea of how it all works

100
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,799
out you see the media pumps out these

101
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,680
stories cuz they're bored and they know

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,480
you'll buy into it their whole business

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,079
is predicated on shitty parents all over

104
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,040
the country believe that anyone who gets

105
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,079
a modom of airtime is somehow

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,360
responsible for being a role model for

107
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,840
their children eat [ __ ] Fame and

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,640
morality aren't mutually exclusive if

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,199
you're willing to accept someone at the

110
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,759
drop of a hat to be a role model for you

111
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,880
and your stupid kids don't get your

112
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,880
panties in a l when they do or say

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,479
something you don't agree with you Dopey

114
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,160
[ __ ] my point is aggressive marketing

115
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,360
and media hoopla are just going to keep

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,080
shoving nonsense down your throat until

117
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,160
you have the gag reflex of Sasha Gray

118
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,440
eventually stupid people will swallow

119
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,280
anything controversial as a significant

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,600
issue because in the end all they're

121
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,360
worried about is taking a side people

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,039
love to take sides in this country

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,199
you're the problem that's the problem

124
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,840
let me tell you what the problem is it

125
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
makes them feel important when they

126
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,199
regurgitate unoriginal opinions between

127
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,639
the water cooler and keeping up with the

128
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,039
Joneses they have no real social

129
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,800
aptitude so they put moral stock in

130
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,840
celebrities because they believe that

131
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,039
success is measured by how much money

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,240
you have or how often you make an

133
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,400
appearance on television and they want

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,960
so desperately to be identified in that

135
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,680
very same way so strong opinions about

136
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,960
nonsense issues fills that void for them

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,479
everybody wants a mansion and an iPhone

138
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,800
and a hard dick and a lollipop they want

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,680
a pat on the back they want spinner rims

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,680
and a bedazzled Ed hearty t-shirt they

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,639
want a cool haircut and fake tits and a

142
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,600
dog in their purse they don't give a

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,960
[ __ ] they want courtside seats in Paul

144
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Walker movies and they apparently want

145
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,240
all of that to the sound of the guy that

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,440
broke their Achy Breaky

147
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,880
Heart what do I

148
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,440
want I want to be inspired I want a cup

149
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,440
of coffee and I want to be left the [ __ ]

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,440
alone
