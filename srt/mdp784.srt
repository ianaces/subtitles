house I'm actually in the house you're

92
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,799
in the house I'm in I'm in the apartment

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,599
I can keep showing you the the yeah you

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,479
got a lot of stuff here I had a comedy

95
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,720
magazine in in the early 2000s and that

96
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,080
was that was the magazine I'm looking at

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
the picture of Marin and we spelled his

98
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
name wrong on the cover which I think we

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,240
put it with a K yeah but I think we

100
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,240
might have been like the first ones to

101
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,520
put him on a a cover of a magazine too

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,080
so it was bittersweet yeah he never he

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,440
never brought it up in fact it took

104
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,120
years till till he blew up and then I

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
started realized that his name was

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,560
misspelled yeah I remember the Boston

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
Comedy Festival gave me a really hard

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,479
time about putting him on there and I'm

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,800
like but he's a Boston guy they're like

110
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,400
nobody knows who he is nobody's going to

111
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
pick up this magazine we're sponsoring

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
this thing I'm like but he's really

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,960
funny they're like it's not about that

114
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,759
who do they want on the cover it's

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,720
anyone more famous they didn't care

116
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,280
they're like just want Lenny Clark they

117
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,880
would have gone for probably Lenny Clark

118
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,520
they I remember they said to me like I'm

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,680
trying to think of who was more famous

120
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,800
in Boston then the guy was cool from the

121
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Boston Comedy Festival uh but he was

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,840
like listen I get it I'm into comedy too

123
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,880
but nobody knows who this guy is I get

124
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,000
it just pick somebody else for a com I'm

125
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
like I already told Mark well first time

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,160
I met uh Eugene Merman was he was he

127
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,080
interviewed me for a something a paper

128
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,560
or something or maybe school he went to

129
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,840
am I mean went to uh uh uh Hampshire

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,319
college and so yeah so he was a cub

131
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,080
reporter when I met him he had a Fedor

132
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,800
on and it said press

133
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,240
no now I remember I I did the interview

134
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,960
already I was there was no way I was

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,039
going back to Mark Marin and saying I'm

136
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,680
sorry I'm not putting you on the cover

137
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,120
after I said that I just had to fight

138
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
for it well that's good now does he how

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,479
about where's your relationship now with

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,199
him we'll do this interview as if it is

141
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,240
a

142
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:06,000
WTF I did WTF so we all good we're good

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,840
we're good we're good all right so uh I

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,479
know absolutely nothing about uh

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,720
philosophy outside of um anything that

146
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,599
could be boiled down to a bumper sticker

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,759
so right whoever wrote um ask grass or

148
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,400
gas No One Rides For Free might be my

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,080
biggest

150
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,319
philosophy inspiration I'm I'm trying to

151
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,759
be as shallow as possible in life this

152
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,960
is not uh I think I do actually have

153
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:35,800
philosophies in my life I I I often uh

154
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,479
you know I I truly believe that um it's

155
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,120
important to quit a lot in life you know

156
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,599
I think I think you should quit until

157
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,759
you end up someplace where you don't

158
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:47,479
want to leave you know and and I've done

159
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,919
that in my career I've quit uh a lot

160
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,720
actually and it's funny I didn't realize

161
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,319
until recently that I keep quitting I

162
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,240
didn't realize that it was pointed out

163
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,560
by my roommates you know and I I always

164
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,039
jokingly say you know 53 with roommates

165
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,319
it's really coming together so do you

166
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,280
really want to listen to this guy's

167
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,599
philosophies on life but I will say um

168
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm way happier than I ever have been in

169
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:13,360
life and I don't know if it's because of

170
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,759
any um ways I've decided to live my life

171
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,080
at this age or if it's simply just

172
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,120
testosterone fleeing my body but I do

173
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,560
know that I'm way less angry I do know

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,319
that I'm never been more productive as

175
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,840
as somebody who who tells stories

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,479
so sometimes I'm on stage on the road

177
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,080
and I'm doing my AC and I'm like going

178
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,160
well I'm doing a lot of old bits and and

179
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,560
then I think of like when I ego surf on

180
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,319
the internet and someone will say

181
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,120
something snarky about that maybe I did

182
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,879
some stories before old old material and

183
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,240
then I thought but you know I've also

184
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,919
written a few screenplays and made a few

185
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,000
movies in between the last time I was in

186
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,120
your town so so the true granted I

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,759
probably don't have the freshest

188
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,800
nightclub act but I do I I do I am a

189
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,599
little more productive I think than um

190
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,319
than people would think I am yeah and

191
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,400
the people who write the comments are

192
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,919
probably not doing anything yeah which

193
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,280
is really it's not even like you could

194
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,759
say oh who are these people stuff but

195
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,440
but sometimes when you go down a rabbit

196
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,520
hole and you look at somebody who who

197
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,479
writes really

198
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,199
well character assassinations like a lot

199
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:25,800
of the guys who write comments like on

200
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,000
on the AV Squad they're very funny and

201
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,440
they're sharp and some of them are very

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,760
articulate and they're very well-crafted

203
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,919
and you just want to go well maybe

204
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,240
that's how that is their form maybe that

205
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,320
is their Outlet creatively because part

206
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,640
of me wants to go I don't have that kind

207
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,959
of time to write that kind of thesis on

208
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,399
um on a television program that I watch

209
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,959
why not you know you could you could

210
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,000
write a television program in that same

211
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,880
same amount of time and energy yeah I

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,880
always wonder about that like the they

213
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,320
they like dig through all these old TV

214
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,959
shows and and I can't even get through

215
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,120
the article like I I like to like think

216
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,839
that I'm I'm like oh I can this is excit

217
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,440
this speaks to me in like one paragraph

218
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,839
into it I'm like I just remember I liked

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,720
it

220
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,160
yeah I remember I laughed you know I

221
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,519
don't know uh the Advent of the digital

222
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,720
age has changed the way comedy is

223
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,000
perceived where it used to be there's a

224
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,240
handful of Gatekeepers you know people

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
you get on The Tonight Show and that

226
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,920
would change your career or young

227
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,440
comedians on HBO or maybe Letterman or

228
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,320
evening at The Improv or whatever but

229
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,079
there wasn't very many Gatekeepers and

230
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,399
now with podcasts and and YouTube and

231
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,560
things like that folks can make their

232
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:44,560
own products and get their own audience

233
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,920
but the the weird part is is that one of

234
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,040
the things that came up and I'm all for

235
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,640
that I love the idea that that people

236
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,440
don't have to be mainstream anymore to

237
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,360
have

238
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,519
success um as a comedian but this this

239
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,399
new thing that cropped up

240
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,399
is H there's a lot of people that treat

241
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,440
comedy like it's Sports now so now

242
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,880
there's like people who top 10 funniest

243
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,880
guys ever or or you know and it's like

244
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,800
what are you doing this is it's it's

245
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,360
allegedly an art form don't don't

246
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,240
diminish it and and make it you know D

247
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,160
you know or that guy's a professional

248
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,320
like that's the most insulting thing

249
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,600
anyone I think could ever say to me

250
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,600
about any job I do as a director a

251
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,360
writer as a comedian is that you're a

252
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,640
professional yeah yeah that's insulting

253
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,920
to me cuz that means that there is

254
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:40,000
absolutely no craft art

255
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,240
inspiration or anything to your act

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,519
outside of just trying to please and uh

257
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,040
to you know you're good at your

258
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,000
profession you're good at to be a

259
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,560
professional

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,920
comedian I mean I'm already getting paid

261
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,600
jokes yeah yeah he's a professional he

262
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,240
did so great he didn't you know he

263
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,839
didn't he didn't read from notes on

264
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,040
stage

265
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,720
you know I've saw Carlin a bunch over

266
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
the years and I don't remember ever

267
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,880
seeing George Carlin without notes on

268
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,360
stage M so what you guys say George

269
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,560
Carlin's not professional because he

270
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
read he read notes very unprofessional

271
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,160
George Carlin was very unprofessional I

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
remember he talked about the comics he

273
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,720
didn't like as suit and tie nice guys I

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,560
always thought that was like such a nice

275
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,040
ring to that like yeah suit and tie nice

276
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,240
guys yeah yeah or yeah when I I was a

277
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,639
little past that so when I was a kid it

278
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,480
was sweater comedians you know that was

279
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,959
what we rebelled against sweater

280
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,160
comedians guys who went up in sweaters

281
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,720
and uh talked about datings and and

282
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,399
things that not only did it not interest

283
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,360
me I I I I you know it was by the I was

284
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,639
such a comedy nerd when I was a little

285
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,959
boy it's funny that I find I find adult

286
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,240
comedy nerds frustrating I was such a

287
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,839
comedy nerd when I was a boy that by the

288
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,800
time I became an adult I no longer

289
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,079
wanted to be a standup comedian I kind

290
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,920
of wanted to make fun of The Craft M

291
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,320
yeah which you did I did and then later

292
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,560
on in life I became the very thing I was

293
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,839
making fun of cuz you know now I'm a

294
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,720
Storyteller when I tell do standup well

295
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,519
do you still want to go back to that guy

296
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,680
sometimes no you know I think I get to

297
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,360
to Tom Kenny was saying my friend Tom

298
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,399
Kenny um you know he he said that I used

299
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,959
to people didn't know what they were

300
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,160
going to see when they saw me because I

301
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:31,560
was new or they had no expectations so I

302
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,199
could flip them out by by doing weird

303
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,440
things and whatever I wanted to do on

304
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,040
stage and then once there was an

305
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,519
expectation that that was what was going

306
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,399
to happen I guess for me now the biggest

307
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,279
way to freak people out is going up as

308
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,839
myself but but that's why I make movies

309
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,959
because because then the expectation

310
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,720
every time you make a movie is is is

311
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,240
Limitless you know so so so that's why I

312
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
really enjoy making movies he said it

313
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
made sense that I went on to to go on

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,120
and make movies it's just curveballs you

315
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,399
like throwing these curveballs pretty

316
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,519
much I do but I don't I don't really

317
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,560
think of the audience as much as myself

318
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,000
I I like to see if I can tell these

319
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,240
stories that's and of course part of

320
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,639
telling a story is you have to connect

321
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,880
with an audience but I don't really

322
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,399
connect with a major audience I I

323
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,079
connect with

324
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:19,040
um tiny audience and and in film

325
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,160
festivals that's that's that's where I

326
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,399
see my movies with people my movies make

327
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,199
hundreds of dollars well that's good

328
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,120
it's it's more than a lot of them yeah

329
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:32,560
and it doesn't bother me I you know I

330
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,040
have such disdain for so much things

331
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,560
that are popular in pop culture that

332
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,360
that I would rather not be right but

333
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,360
that's the position you've always taken

334
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,399
that seems like yeah I think I've spent

335
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,040
too much of my time making stuff and

336
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,880
doing what I was interested in and not a

337
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,600
lot of time really being too concerned

338
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,600
with how I was perceived by people is

339
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,199
that a

340
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,959
mistake I think in history I won't be

341
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,800
remembered as anybody that

342
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:04,519
you know I mean and and that's okay but

343
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,839
I mean sadly there's been so

344
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,680
many deaths

345
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,240
lately and show business I I do realize

346
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,600
that I'll be remembered for the guy who

347
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,079
was in Police Academy even no matter how

348
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,639
many more movies I make you know and and

349
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,120
that's okay cuz I know my friends and

350
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,839
family will reme remember me hopefully

351
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,480
in the way I'd like to be remembered

352
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,680
yeah how important is it to you that you

353
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,959
be remembered still I mean it's it's

354
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,440
it's not because I know it's not un un

355
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,240
unachievable that that there's nothing I

356
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,160
can do that's going to

357
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:43,560
erase uh being in three Police Academy

358
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,480
movies from from everybody's mind yeah

359
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,600
do you do you wish you could not be in

360
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,000
them do you no because everything I did

361
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,720
ended up making me who I am so so so I

362
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
don't regret them well let's say you

363
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,519
could still be who you were who you are

364
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,720
now but I could be a guy making small

365
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:05,759
movies and and doing standup to pay my

366
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:09,480
rent uh yeah I would not do

367
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,440
them really yeah yeah but what about

368
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,360
other people but I mean Bill Murray says

369
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,759
it's the same thing actually you know he

370
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,360
says that if you want to be rich and

371
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:22,040
famous try to figure out a way just to

372
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,360
be rich you know so I mean so so you

373
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,319
know um and his body of work is way less

374
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,399
embarrassing than mine I'm I'm surprised

375
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:35,199
that you're embarrassed by it really

376
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:37,399
well I'm not embarrassed as much as um I

377
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,800
spent so much in my life and time

378
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,399
discussing it that it it

379
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,240
becomes

380
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,399
uh a lot like especially on the road

381
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,800
it's a lot like Groundhog Day you know

382
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,720
so so I go out and do press and it's

383
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,279
people asking me and talking to me all

384
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,519
about these movies I made 30 years ago

385
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,880
and and um and I get it I understand

386
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,839
that's how they know me and stuff but

387
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,240
it's probably healthy it's kind of funny

388
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,319
you know the last movie I'm made um well

389
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,720
won nine Awards I just you know at

390
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:16,600
various film festivals I just got one

391
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,160
this morning oh in the mail but so it

392
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,000
it's very nice but um you know my

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,040
ex-wife used to say when I would talk

394
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,959
like this she would say that my diamond

395
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,440
shoes were too tight you know these are

396
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,360
really great problems to have

397
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,199
um I'm I'm fortunate enough that I I've

398
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,120
I've had a second career you know most

399
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,959
people don't get the opportunity to um

400
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,920
to go on and and make movies and direct

401
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,240
television and do all that you know they

402
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,240
just they just um you know think about

403
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,360
show business they don't they

404
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,360
don't it would be nice if you just got

405
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,560
fired it'd be much cleaner if they just

406
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,319
said you're fired no we're done with you

407
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,199
but they don't they say they just go

408
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,720
you're you're not going to make as much

409
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,520
money and you're not going to be as well

410
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,480
known but we're going to put you on um

411
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,160
this year we're going to put you on

412
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,360
Hollywood Squares and you're going to do

413
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,199
the voice of a talking puppet sometimes

414
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,559
I get the feeling I was never hired I

415
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,919
don't know if that's worse yeah that's

416
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,919
what I'm saying so that's why my diamond

417
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,880
shoes a te you were never fired and I

418
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,679
was never hired it probably feels about

419
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,360
the same it's probably the same but you

420
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,319
know often when I'm on the road there'll

421
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,959
be young comedians in the dressing room

422
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,439
and they'll they'll ask me they go you

423
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,400
know do you have any advice I go we're

424
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,799
on the same show

425
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,280
man we're both sitting backstage at

426
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,960
Morty's uh in a Mexican restaurant you

427
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,320
know I you know uh what do I have do I

428
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,679
have any advice don't do any talking

429
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,000
horse movies no

430
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,799
um actually it's funny I do find myself

431
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
doing out advice now and I don't know if

432
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,760
people take it serious because I'm old

433
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,280
or it's funny that they'll actually they

434
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,200
pretend to be listening I don't know if

435
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,960
they listen to it but they they do

436
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,720
pretend they listening do you ever hit

437
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,400
him with advice that you're like oh man

438
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,640
I you tell him something you didn't even

439
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,840
realize you knew no but sometimes you

440
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,919
know what's funny I just got advice from

441
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,640
from Old Friends uh Tim kazarinski oddly

442
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,280
enough who was in Police Academy so I

443
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,760
would do those movies because I'm glad I

444
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,159
met Tim

445
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,520
but I I currently have like a a few

446
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,520
different things that I can possibly do

447
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,720
which is new for me it's usually I make

448
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,039
a movie and I go scramble to go make the

449
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,840
next one and um he was really smart he

450
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,000
said if you could only do one which one

451
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,679
would you do and then it made it really

452
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,720
clear on which one I should spend my

453
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,360
energy trying to get going I feel like

454
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,919
so many times I I talk to comics and

455
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,679
I've done it myself where you just kind

456
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,360
of almost you're living for the memory

457
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,200
that you want to leave

458
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,080
almost well I don't know if that's true

459
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:55,080
in most Comics but I I know that um

460
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,120
there's a you know Barry kremens I made

461
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,280
the documentary about call me lucky you

462
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:05,320
know he always says play for the ages

463
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:08,400
not for the time um but you know I mean

464
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,360
that that it is absurd to want to be

465
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,080
remembered uh because because you are

466
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,559
powerless over the the way you will be

467
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,679
remembered so so to try to control that

468
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,240
would be ridiculous I think I disagree

469
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,480
with them nowadays I think play it for

470
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,760
the time I think now is only thing that

471
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,120
matters yeah basically you know you're

472
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,640
in that room and if you can make make a

473
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,559
dent um or you know it's not like you

474
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:40,120
have to go up

475
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:45,000
there and blow people away with with

476
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:48,000
uh some sort of scathing take on society

477
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,200
or politics or or or personal

478
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,280
relationships it's basically if you can

479
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,480
go up

480
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,960
there and connect with people by by by

481
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,559
giving them a something private

482
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,679
something unique something personal you

483
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,360
know that's pretty exciting yeah and

484
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,960
also just because it doesn't matter if

485
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,880
you're remembered you're dead there is

486
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,559
that too do I care what a bunch of

487
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,960
people who are now dead would think

488
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,559
about me probably not no because those

489
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,000
people are dead and they're they're done

490
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,440
with yeah so why do I care about people

491
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,600
who are around when I'm dead well it's

492
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,440
it's the the part of our brain that when

493
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,080
we're a kid you you when you realize

494
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,280
that you're not going to live forever

495
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,720
you bum out and then when you realize

496
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,080
and the next thing is you realize your

497
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,480
parents are going to die you bum out

498
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,919
about that so there's the god part of

499
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,400
our brain where some folks say that's

500
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:48,080
God has created in this part of our

501
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,679
brain where we are trying to

502
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,799
justify things we can't answer or

503
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:57,880
Justify where we go when we die MH so uh

504
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,120
the god part of a comedian or an artist

505
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,200
brain

506
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,039
is trying to might say well there's no

507
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,799
heaven but I'll live in on Forever by my

508
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,240
work uhhuh which is absurd it's just a

509
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,279
chasing of immortality one way one way

510
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,919
or another you ever really care about

511
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:19,640
what what nine-year-olds think of you

512
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,480
like well I I do because that's who I'm

513
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,159
speaking to every night when I play a

514
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,159
comedy club I'm I'm talking to people

515
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,440
who have their 9-year-old memory of me

516
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,159
right so I talk to the n years old every

517
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,919
night cuz they always show me how tall

518
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,679
they were they always go I was this big

519
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,520
when I watched you I don't know why they

520
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,960
always have to tell me how tall they

521
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,080
were but they do you ever act really

522
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,559
impressed by how they've grown how tall

523
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,360
wow you really shot up that's you must

524
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,559
have eating your vegetables you're

525
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,400
kidding you were that short wait wait

526
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,720
cuz

527
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,039
usually you know when you forget about

528
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,559
me you're going to be about 3 in shorter

529
00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:00,120
cuz when the dementia hits you're going

530
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:02,200
to lose m yeah that's another thing by

531
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,080
the way you create the perfect memory of

532
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,159
yourself in these people's heads and

533
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,600
then they all get to Mena anyway yeah

534
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:13,240
that's true best case best case if they

535
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,799
don't just drop dead it does sound um we

536
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,360
sound very fatalistic but creating in

537
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:21,320
that moment on stage or that new

538
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,360
painting or screenplay or song you're

539
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,039
you're giving the middle finger to death

540
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,640
you know even if you're making neol

541
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:31,320
listic art you're still

542
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,840
showing up you're still trying to

543
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,240
connect so I guess at the end of the day

544
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,640
you know for me I don't I don't know if

545
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,600
I believe in a God or a higher power but

546
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,080
I do believe in the the the the power of

547
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,559
Storytelling which you know there's

548
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,279
these certain formulas and if I get them

549
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:53,279
right someone across the world can look

550
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,200
at the story I made and it can affect

551
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,799
them in their brain in a way where they

552
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,039
feel things so I mean that's that's a

553
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,080
pretty that's huge that's crazy if you

554
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,440
think about it the people in Japan will

555
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,799
watch God Bless America and laugh is is

556
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,320
insane that's I can't even wrap my brain

557
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,000
around that or when I go to Europe with

558
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,240
my my my movies um you know

559
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,840
it's it's funny I mean it's easy it is

560
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,039
funny that like my my movies are are are

561
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,360
better received in in other

562
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,159
countries so I'm I'm the that makes you

563
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,760
a real artist yeah I'm the new Jerry

564
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,240
Lewis or or Sam Fuller I'm going to go

565
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,559
I'm going to go live in Paris or

566
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,200
something but yeah but yeah that's that

567
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,600
that's not me bragging that's that means

568
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,279
you're doing art you know if they don't

569
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,320
like I guess yeah they don't like me

570
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:43,880
here but uh yeah you ever look at an

571
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,240
audience and try and single out people

572
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,600
and say who in this audience might

573
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,799
trying to impress well yeah you know I

574
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,520
try not to because um you know there's I

575
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,720
just did a video with a a man who's very

576
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,320
beautiful and he dresses as a woman I

577
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,000
don't know how he identifies he just

578
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,400
identifies as a gay man he doesn't

579
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,840
identify as a drag queen or trans but I

580
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,000
did I put him in a video with a pop star

581
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,720
uh not pop star but a a valid singer and

582
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,360
the

583
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,880
video was shocking in the fact that I

584
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,480
just played that character as a normal

585
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:23,039
person with a normal relationship so it

586
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:27,440
the result was some people found it

587
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,279
shocking and it's not but I ran into a

588
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,279
guy this weekend who I would have

589
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:36,640
dismissed if I judged him from the stage

590
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:39,480
M he had like a he had like a uh he had

591
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,080
a Cubby's baseball hat on and all this

592
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,600
and then he came up to me and he said

593
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,120
that was really great video like he

594
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,480
liked that so so you can never tell who

595
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,240
who you're going to connect with you

596
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,440
know it's surprising it you can't you

597
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,520
can't you can't you never know you know

598
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,720
you can't you it just it'll always

599
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,919
backfire I I think it's interesting that

600
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,679
for a long time your act kind of like

601
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,600
hid who you were yeah and then you got

602
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,399
ultimately frustrated that people didn't

603
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,760
know who you were and uh you ound up

604
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:15,600
being misrepresented but the weird part

605
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,559
is I don't promote the new

606
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,480
me which is strange like I don't promote

607
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,159
like I don't go on talk shows I don't do

608
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:28,399
a podcast I don't do the things even

609
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:33,120
though I've changed who I am on stage

610
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:36,120
it's still kind of a secret I I I I mean

611
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,240
I really think in a weird way if it was

612
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,159
up to me at this point in my career I

613
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,760
would not be in front of the mic I would

614
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,840
not be only well it is up to you I mean

615
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:50,039
I would well I mean I I'm up I'm I'm up

616
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,039
on stage sometimes for fun so that's not

617
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,320
true I do enjoy that like when I host

618
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,320
crab apples with Caitlyn Gil my friend

619
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,320
but when I when I'm on the road I I do a

620
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:06,279
lot of standup

621
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:10,000
to pay my bills so I can keep making

622
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:11,720
movies you know I I make a I make a

623
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,039
living so I can make movies I don't make

624
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,440
a living making movies I thought it was

625
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,440
really interesting When I Was preparing

626
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,399
for this interview I'm like oh I love

627
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,200
bobcat and then I realized I don't even

628
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:24,159
know who Bobcat

629
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,520
is that's and then I thought well I

630
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,720
guess the most I know about him is from

631
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,080
the crab apple show that talking about

632
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,080
that you do at the Improv uh and you did

633
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,360
my show bookshelf at The

634
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,799
Improv and then I I watched a bunch of

635
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,559
interviews with you and most of them

636
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,840
were about you talking about Robin

637
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,840
Williams passing away right I mean that

638
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,960
was what's defined me in the past few

639
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,480
years um initially when he died I didn't

640
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,480
discuss it at

641
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,120
all and now I find myself talking about

642
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,960
it partially because he died from Louis

643
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,480
body dementia which was misdiagnosed as

644
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,520
Parkinson's uh which was something even

645
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,039
that he kept secret but um and I like to

646
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,600
talk about I don't enjoy talking about

647
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,360
it but I like it to be out there so

648
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,039
people don't think he died from

649
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,080
depression or drugs or you're protecting

650
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,559
his memory yeah I am protecting his

651
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,960
memory because he he was a fighter you

652
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:24,320
know and he he he fought with this

653
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,039
dementia uh you know and and and and I

654
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,279
don't mean to

655
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,000
diminish um you know people die from

656
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,240
depression and it's a very serious thing

657
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,200
but I I just want people to know that

658
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,360
that that that's not he had a disease

659
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,320
that that's very fatal anyways um

660
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,799
despite him taking his own life but he

661
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,039
was getting misinformation from his own

662
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,840
head you know towards the end he got

663
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,760
very

664
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,440
quiet and I was talking to his widow and

665
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,519
I said do you think he

666
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,880
was you know what do you think that was

667
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:00,960
about and we both kind of thought that

668
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:04,000
it it was because he was was getting

669
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,279
facts that weren't right and and he knew

670
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,720
they weren't right so he kind of stopped

671
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:11,840
even talking too much you know that's

672
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,480
that's what she and I believe but you

673
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,720
know now I'm just still processing all

674
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,720
of it to to have someone pass away have

675
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,679
someone pass away who connected with so

676
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,399
many people and and and perpetuated a a

677
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,760
a personality that

678
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,200
was part of him but wasn't you know

679
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,240
wasn't wasn't the the Rob and I my

680
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,960
relationship with you guys were like two

681
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,760
two real people in hiding and and the

682
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
whole world knew these like fake

683
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,799
versions of you guys yeah that's pretty

684
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,480
accurate and if you heard us talking you

685
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,799
would go those are the most boring guys

686
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,720
of what that is really true and maybe

687
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,720
that's why we clicked and we're such

688
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,240
good friends you know we both had these

689
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,480
personas that we perpetuated to protect

690
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,279
ourselves from from from people knowing

691
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,399
who we really were so it one thing that

692
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,760
strikes me talking to you about all this

693
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,279
is is that you seem like a very

694
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,440
vulnerable guy and I'm not surprised by

695
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,640
it but your your act that everybody very

696
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,360
aggressive so aggressive and it's so

697
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,039
like and even now sometimes like last

698
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,880
week when I was at crab apples I was

699
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,159
really nasty I must have been feeling

700
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
scared or something but yeah it's it's

701
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,159
how I kept people away and and I and I

702
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,919
think Robin was even more vulnerable

703
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,200
than myself um so he always seemed like

704
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,600
a very sweet sensitive guy he was really

705
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:43,480
sweet and really sensitive and you know

706
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:47,200
he was very uh uh he's he he was good at

707
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,320
keep keeping a distance with people by

708
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,360
by by giving them what they wanted which

709
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,039
might

710
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:59,320
be to perform or or or whatever but but

711
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,679
but yeah we we both did a really good

712
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,840
job of of of kind of hiding who we are

713
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:08,880
you ever think about

714
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,640
why um I can't speak for him I mean

715
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,919
because I'm insecure you know like all

716
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,960
people you know I think I think the idea

717
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,919
of and I think that's part of why I was

718
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,600
destructive for so long because you know

719
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,679
as a younger man I was given

720
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,000
opportunities to probably really put

721
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,279
myself out there and I didn't have the

722
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,440
tools so it would be it's easier to to

723
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:33,320
tell the president of a network or

724
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,320
Studio to go cram it than it is to

725
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,000
create and and say well this is me this

726
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,960
is how I see the world so you know

727
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,320
that's the phase I'm at now and and the

728
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,559
movies that I make are

729
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,039
are well they're all different kinds but

730
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,320
often they're they're simple in some

731
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:56,399
ways they're very like fables they're

732
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,519
not accurate slices of life

733
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,000
um but

734
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,519
but but that's I mean that's that's

735
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,159
that's kind of how I see the world I'm

736
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,880
always trying to figure out at the end

737
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,039
of the day there's so many

738
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,840
under there's so

739
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,840
many uh preconceived truths that we live

740
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,000
in and I'm I'm always interested in in

741
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,279
exploring there's always an exception to

742
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,440
all these rules yeah and that's why

743
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,840
that's what interests me in making

744
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,120
movies all my movies at the end of the

745
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,480
day are usually about trying to find

746
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,080
some sort of Truth and

747
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,760
um I think that's kind of weird because

748
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,480
uh I'll look at other filmmakers and

749
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,919
that's not what their body work is about

750
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,880
I'm not saying mine's better or worse

751
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,919
but it's interesting you know why is it

752
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,080
weird to

753
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,000
you I I don't know why that's what I'm

754
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,919
obsessed with as a

755
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,240
Storyteller you know I think when you

756
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,159
were a kid and you found out that the

757
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,480
there is no Santa Claus or whatever you

758
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,760
know I was I took that really

759
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,519
hard basically

760
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,880
that's what my whole body of work is

761
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,200
based on I'm still mad that everybody

762
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,760
was lying well it seems like you're more

763
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,960
Fearless now than you were when you

764
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,799
seemed Fearless yeah that's true it's

765
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,480
funny because it's different that before

766
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:18,720
it was like f you I don't care and

767
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,080
destruction and now it's it's it's it's

768
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,320
the

769
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,960
um it's

770
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,600
me

771
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,559
really making these movies and things

772
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,360
that are challenging for

773
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,440
people but I'm not trying to piss them

774
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,480
off I'm just you know looking for the

775
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,240
other Starbelly snitches the other

776
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,159
people that see the world the way I do I

777
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,639
like that star belly

778
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,919
sne man that's cool that's really cool

779
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:49,000
um yeah when when you came in I was

780
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,159
after watching going back to my original

781
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,960
thing I was watching all these things

782
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,720
where you talk about Robin I'm like okay

783
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,679
but he's not talking about himself he's

784
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,039
talking about Robin and then I was

785
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,080
watching a lot of you and I'm like well

786
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,360
he's not really talking about about

787
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,760
himself there uh he's he's just

788
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,519
something else and then I'm like he's

789
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,840
not even really Bobcat he's Robbie like

790
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,440

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,399
know for

795
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,559
um yeah you know I tell I'm fairly

796
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:28,240
decent at telling stories but uh only

797
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,760
sometimes I get to where I'll let people

798
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,240
all the way in yeah scary well it's good

799
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,919
you're taking steps towards it I'm

800
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,960
excited to see like what kind of art is

801
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,559
g to come out what Happ well yeah

802
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,760
or or I'll get hit by a

803
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:45,519
bus and then we'll remember you as a

804
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,760
police academy yeah the police academy

805
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,559
dude it's come full circle all right

806
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,919
should we get into the philosopher yes

807
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,039
we should all right the guy that Alex

808
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,799
picked out for you I wonder if it's

809
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,159
pronounced Jorge or George it's j o RJ e

810
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm going to go Jorge you're going to go

811
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,240
Jorge with by the way I don't know if I

812
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,360
told you I don't look at any of this

813
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,599
until you do cuz otherwise I come in

814
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,320
with an upper hand so it's Jorge

815
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,760
Francisco

816
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,079
isidoro Lis

817
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,040
Borges I've heard of Borges I think I

818
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:20,240
think this is like a way longer way of

819
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,240
just saying

820
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,119
Borges have you heard of Borges no I'm

821
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,159
I've heard the name but I I don't know

822
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,000
the context all right let's hear um so

823
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,919
Alex writes Bobcat lit the tonight's

824
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,240
show on fire so I picked a philosopher

825
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,800
who talks about

826
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,720
hell

827
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,280
good but by the way what where were you

828
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:44,280
in your head at that point which part of

829
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,480
hell I was uh very destructive and uh

830
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,960
running on fear and uh I got really

831
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,839
frustrated with the fact that I could go

832
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,879
on a talk show and I would do very well

833
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,320
but it wasn't changing where I was and I

834
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,520
kind of got to the point where I was

835
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,720
like well I don't want to be on these

836
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,560
shows anymore and I was slightly

837
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,800
influenced by Kaufman and oddly enough

838
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,359
Prince I remember Prince setting a

839
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,160
guitar on fire I mean I know Hendrick

840
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,960
did it but I saw Prince Set uh not a

841
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,040
guitar I think he set his contracts on

842
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,720
fire on a talk show uhuh yeah so so I

843
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,359
thought oh maybe I'll start a fire so

844
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,079
nobody knew you were going to do it when

845
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,200
no no they were really upset they were

846
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,599
they were really upset but I did tell my

847
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,359
buddy I said stand by the fire

848
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:32,240
extinguisher in case this thing gos out

849
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:35,359
of hand so so there was some prep that's

850
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,760
great uh bores says that hell is an

851
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,680
illogical mess of an idea used mostly

852
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,400
for

853
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,160
propaganda its main logical problem is

854
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,880
this because a human life is finite

855
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,320
there are a finite number of sins one

856
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,359
can commit because a human's power is

857
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,480
finite there is a finite power to the

858
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,480
evil that he can perform therefore an

859
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,440
Infinity long and Powerful punishment is

860
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,000
always disproportionate it because man

861
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,640
can never earn it if God is truly all

862
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,960
loving and all knowing he would not

863
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,760
commit such a mathematical error I

864
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,960
like hell only works if you don't think

865
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,200
about it too much well you know when I

866
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,720
was a kid I was raised Catholic so you

867
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,000
know you could go to hell for not

868
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,160
actually doing a sin but just thinking

869
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,160
about it and then dying before you had a

870
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,119
chance to be absolved from that sin wow

871
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,240
so you just a tiny child basically

872
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,560
pretty sure you're going to go to hell

873
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,240
maybe Purgatory because human nature

874
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,440
every thought runs through your head at

875
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,160
one point you know um so it's it's the

876
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,800
it's acting on these things that

877
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,640
separates us

878
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,160
from from being animals but uh yeah so

879
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,400
it's a really great place the Catholic

880
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,960
church is a great place to make

881
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
comedians cuz you're just racked with

882
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,319
guilt

883
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,880
and you're obsessed with exposing truth

884
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:04,560
mhm yeah I like the idea about the the

885
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,119
finite and the infinite being

886
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,040
disproportional yeah also um is he

887
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,880
suggesting that there is an afterlife I

888
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,040
mean that just seems well I I think he's

889
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,520
saying that if there is an afterlife

890
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,359
that there is no hell it's it's always

891
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,640
fascinating to me the differences in

892
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,440
when I talk to to Catholics cuz I was

893
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,200
raised religious Jewish and and like we

894
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,000
didn't have a concept of Hell there

895
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,400
we have something that's that's like a

896
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,480
cleansing process that can only take 12

897
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,720
months so it's not

898
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,000
infinite that's why when when the Jew

899
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,480
dies uh people say cottage for him you

900
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,359
know yes and they only say it for 11

901
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,560
months because 12 months would be for

902
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,640
Hitler like the very worst person in the

903
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,640
world could would take 12 months to

904
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,079
cleanse sure so for a regular person

905
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,640
we're like for sure 11 months covers it

906
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,280
is a good guy he may me knock off at 6

907
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,440
months

908
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,920
for 11 months we're basically saying

909
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,480
spare this guy after that we know he's

910
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,680
okay yeah so there is no infinite hell

911
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,200
uh and even what we have as hell is only

912
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,599
just a discomfort a cleansing process of

913
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,160
the Soul so are you are you burning in a

914
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:20,520
fire or um I like to think of it like an

915
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,520
acid

916
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:29,520
wash all right so so where do you go

917
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:34,240
though after to the acid wash is there

918
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,880
the you go Florida of course is there um

919
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,119
is there like purgatory and heaven or

920
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,440
it's just Heaven no there's just this

921
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,560
this atonement for it's just another

922
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,960
world it's just another world it's just

923
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,400
another world there's an idea that

924
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,839
there's seven

925
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,000
worlds and uh there are different levels

926
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,160
of impurity in the different worlds and

927
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,640
we're on the lowest world then you move

928
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,760
up to the next World which is a little

929
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,640
more pure okay and uh where is this

930
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,200
world uh it's it's a different realm

931
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,920
it's a different Universe it's a

932
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,599
different everything this actually holds

933
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,560
more water to me than than living in the

934
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,960
Earth with Devils right there's no devil

935
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,000
in in the sky I like this idea that

936
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,000
there's this this there are different

937
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,720
planes there's different Realms that

938
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,400
that that could actually exist and you

939
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,040
could get bumped down to this one again

940
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
if you didn't do it right yeah so it's

941
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,640
reincarnation there's a lot of

942
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,599
reincarnation yeah oh I didn't realize

943
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,240
that yeah I remember learning that most

944
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,880
people that are here right now are on

945
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,680
their second or third time around oh

946
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,880
really

947
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:43,119
yeah so so they're just not good at it

948
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,960
yeah this is uh this is all new to me

949
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,880
see um 53 so yeah I mean it's what's the

950
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,359
last one though it sounds like a pyramid

951
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,319
scheme what's the last one Does Elon

952
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:54,319
hover take you out on the yacht or where

953
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:56,680
do you go uh well then there's just

954
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,160
different higher levels of of closeness

955
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,480
to together to God so then towards the

956
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,079
end it's just you're just but then

957
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,440
there's also the understanding that

958
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,560
there is no real separation between us

959
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,319
and God right it's just

960
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,319
one energy but that's another thought

961
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:18,720
that's that's a pretty good thought that

962
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:21,000
that you're connected that's not a bad I

963
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,040
oh no I like it I like that too my

964
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,359
higher power is

965
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,839
reality because when I'm spinning out

966
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:33,079
I'm not in reality like describe what

967
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,760
spinning out is for you well when I'm

968
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,119
living in fear when I'm thinking that

969
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,400
I'm not enough or this is going to

970
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,680
horrible things are going to happen or

971
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,839
that I'm a failure or I I'm

972
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,960
disappointing people or all these things

973
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,079
when I can stop and go oh you know the

974
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,240
equivalent of praying or whatever I said

975
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,280
well let me look at reality that's my

976
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,760
equivalent let me talk to God let me let

977
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,400
me look at reality reality is it's like

978
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,880
people aren't going to hate you yeah you

979
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,920
you actually showed up and and sometimes

980
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:10,119
there's so much uh things that I

981
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,640
perceive as as

982
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,280
Injustice you know when someone dies

983
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,760
early or there's a tragedy or all that

984
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,720
kind of stuff I can go well what's

985
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,079
reality and the reality of it is is yeah

986
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,200
it is it's really uneven and again then

987
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,520
then it shifts back and I have gratitude

988
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,400
in my life I know practice is all the

989
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,880
time but reality is enough of a higher

990
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,160
power for me and I'm not I used to

991
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,960
identify as an atheist but now I

992
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:39,200
identify as an agnostic because you know

993
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,240
Science is based on hypothesis proving

994
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,000
hypothesis correct so I'm not going to

995
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,040
rule out that there might not be a

996
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,720
higher being or meaning or cuz that

997
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,040
flies in the face of s you're sliding

998
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,440
towards the god side I'm going to say

999
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,800
agnostic I I I I guess yeah I guess I am

1000
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,560
which is which is weird

1001
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,040
um but I think it's because there's so

1002
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,520
much zealots in The Atheist movement

1003
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,760
that really remind me of Christian

1004
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,359
zealots that I don't like right so I'd

1005
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,280
rather just go say I'm agnostic it's

1006
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,000
less of a movement but but as more

1007
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,960
people become agnostic I feel like it's

1008
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,800
really catching on then it'll be a big

1009
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,480
agnostic movement a big agnostic

1010
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,760
movement but that's that's at least your

1011
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,880
brain's open you know right right right

1012
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,880
yeah I just did uh one of these with

1013
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,520
Brian rean also said he recently became

1014
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,599
agnostic from from the other side he

1015
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,800
went from being more of a god believer

1016
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,599
to being more agnostic and uh I was

1017
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,640
telling him like we we had a pretty good

1018
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,240
back and forth about agnostic dating

1019
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,920
sites for people just can't

1020
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,720
commit well he uh you know he's a super

1021
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,240
talented guy and you would see our acts

1022
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,599
they're on the opposite side of the

1023
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,800
world but I I have uh I have nothing but

1024
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,119
respect for him I think he's just such a

1025
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,160
a decent good man you know oh I I

1026
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,240
thought there was more to that I no he's

1027
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,680
just he's just done a few things that

1028
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,319
I'll keep uh I'll I'll let them remain

1029
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,920
anonymous that I CU he asked for that

1030
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,720
but I just thought I just think he's a

1031
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,520
real standup guy I didn't even know when

1032
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,160
I brought him up no no I just really

1033
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,240
admire him yeah cool all right well uh

1034
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,960
he just got a weird shout out yeah I

1035
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,680
like the the not knowing part of it all

1036
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,480
I I I tend to be I'm a God believer yeah

1037
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,119
so I don't know if it's like if there's

1038
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,960
agnostic God Believers and there's

1039
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,599
agnostic atheists and if there's just

1040
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,400
agnostic agnostics right but uh I like I

1041
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,400
like the constant questioning I like the

1042
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,119
constantly and your brain can play so

1043
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,680
many tricks on you it's amazing like you

1044
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,559
were talking about like the spiraling

1045
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,160
out and how you think um everybody hates

1046
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,960
you or everybody's mad at you and I just

1047
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,359
know that so many times I'm like

1048
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,359
completely off the mark from reality

1049
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:58,280
yeah and I was thinking about it today I

1050
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,280
was just like

1051
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,079
man I wonder if I if I could go back to

1052
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,119
like all those younger mes and just kind

1053
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,000
of be like no no no this is what's

1054
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,520
really going on like where would I be

1055
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
now you know well last night I witnessed

1056
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:17,480
something that was So Meta it was uh it

1057
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,520
was it was uh you know it was beautiful

1058
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,960
do you know Daniel Johnston the singer

1059
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:26,440
right

1060
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:29,720
songwriter um so Daniel was sitting in a

1061
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,599
theater we were watching clips of him

1062
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:36,800
from 25 years ago and he hadn't seen the

1063
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,200
clips and his mic was on and there's

1064
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,400
Daniel and he's talking about how how

1065
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,319
the devil's winning the war that rages

1066
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,119
with him there's Daniel saying that it's

1067
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:50,520
the end of times and that you have to

1068
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,559
get right with God and saying all this

1069
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,440
stuff and he's certainly meant and he's

1070
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,480
very passionate while he's saying these

1071
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,160
things on this thing that we're watching

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,160
on screen and Daniel's got his mic and

1073
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,640

00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:08,680
Daniel uh it's this is the future

1075
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,680
everything's okay the world didn't

1076
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,440
end it's a great moment yeah cuz I was

1077
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:19,559
watching it and in in this clip he

1078
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,240
clearly was having a manic episode M and

1079
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,480
I was like I was like well this is

1080
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,559
somewhat dangerous to be presenting a

1081
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,760
person

1082
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,599
with footage that he hadn't seen and it

1083
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,599
ended up being really beautiful it was

1084
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,319
really so sweet it was great it was it

1085
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,079
was genius and the the the thing about

1086
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:41,640
Daniel Johnson that I really love is

1087
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:45,880
that um you know there's certainly

1088
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,240
obviously this real naive uh approach to

1089
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:52,119
how he makes his art or his music but at

1090
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,680
the end of the day there's also uh he is

1091
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,319
aware you know to an extent obviously

1092
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,040
what he said then was aware so it's not

1093
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:02,760
and I do believe his art is valid I

1094
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,119
don't think it's it's it's I don't

1095
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,480
consider his music or art the ramblings

1096
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,920
of somebody who's not stable I there's a

1097
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,520
there's a hurt in him that comes out in

1098
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,680
his song writing and in his paintings

1099
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:20,040
that that um I connect with you know

1100
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,760
even if he was rambling on unstable I'd

1101
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,640
still consider it valid I mean yeah but

1102
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,319
I but but the difference I think between

1103
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:31,839
him and someone who's actually lost

1104
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:35,000
disconnect with reality is is is Daniel

1105
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,760
is forming thoughts and saying this is

1106
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
how I see the world you know and

1107
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,480
sometimes he would have flights where he

1108
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,119
clearly was like I said in a manic state

1109
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,520
but then he'd have these flights where H

1110
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,440
they're not flights they're very thought

1111
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,440
out ideas and tunes and Melodies and and

1112
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,960
I don't know I just I see what you mean

1113
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,520
you know it's I question and then I

1114
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,680
stopped I was sitting in the audience

1115
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,520
and I was

1116
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:04,800
questioning like a little part of me was

1117
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,440
going man you don't get it looking at

1118
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,599
the people in the audience and then I

1119
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,920
said you know what you're what that's

1120
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,079
stop that that you're not here with an

1121
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,920
open heart you know you're judging and

1122
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,640
that's ridiculous so so it was a really

1123
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,400
wonderful thing what you know if there's

1124
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:26,079
a hell it would have to be

1125
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,760
finite um that's what uh Jorge is saying

1126
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,559
here that's what Jorge saying or is

1127
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,559
saying if there's if there's a

1128
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:37,520
hell it couldn't be Limitless cuz we're

1129
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:42,319
we're not Limitless yeah so

1130
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:44,440
we well but you know I think when I when

1131
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:48,240
I was a kid I used to think hell would

1132
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,640
be becoming heaven and hell would be

1133
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:55,800
becoming fully aware

1134
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,520
of of how you your actions really did

1135
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,400
affect other people

1136
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,680
if you really were suddenly attuned to

1137
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,520
all that and if you had lived a decent

1138
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,400
life you would you would be comfortable

1139
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,720
but if you hadn't you you would be in a

1140
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:14,359
lot of pain it's like um Adam croll

1141
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:17,800
remember him talking about if if you

1142
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:20,240
could leave a a mini recorder on a table

1143
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,000
that let's say you're at a a restaurant

1144
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,119
having lunch and then you got up and

1145
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,200
walked away and left a mini pen recorder

1146
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,520
and then you could hear what people said

1147
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,119
you would you would want to kill

1148
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,520
yourself it doesn't matter who you are

1149
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,559
when you left the table people would be

1150
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,079
you know and uh so I guess that was my

1151
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,240
perception you know what would be on

1152
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,040
that mini recorder yeah I've thought

1153
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,559
about that a lot and I also when I was

1154
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,880
telling you earlier today I was thinking

1155
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,800
about going back to the younger me and

1156
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,720
pointing out like how off the mark from

1157
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,280
reality I was here and there and there

1158
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,119
then I thought maybe I'm off the mark

1159
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,760
right now yeah of course how do I know

1160
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:58,839
I'm even well I think I think of of of

1161
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:03,200
how Robin's Remembered in the way I

1162
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:06,599
remember him and how that's

1163
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:11,559
just and then I also triy to not make

1164
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:15,680
his memories in my life just be

1165
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:19,400
stories to to kind of

1166
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:23,160
constantly unearth new memories that I

1167
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:26,480
remember of him in my effort to keep him

1168
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,079
alive on a personal level you know uh

1169
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,599
one that I just had was cuz my

1170
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,079
birthday's coming up I remember when I

1171
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,559
turned 50 he lives in San Francisco he

1172
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,359
calls me up he wishes me happy

1173
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,760
birthday and then I walk into my house

1174
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,400
and he's on the phone in my living room

1175
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,319
he let me think that he was up in San

1176
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,319
Francisco and he had flown down and

1177
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:49,559
surprised me wow so those are the

1178
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:53,680
memories that I'll always you know I try

1179
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:57,280
to keep them alive and not stories but

1180
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,799
the feelings yeah

1181
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,760
that's incredible you had that

1182
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:02,319
friendship that's just like a kind of

1183
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,640
people don't have friendships like that

1184
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,960
yeah and that's the other thing you know

1185
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,160
it's like I often felt like I was never

1186
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,000
going to recover from his loss like I

1187
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,839
thought um it was like losing an arm and

1188
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,920
i' just learn how to live without having

1189
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:20,799
an arm but I've I've I've definitely

1190
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:26,400
come through the other side and now I'm

1191
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:28,640
starting to process it all and um um I'm

1192
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,280
trying trying to process it through the

1193
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,400
things I I

1194
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,359
make do you remember the first time you

1195
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,599
met Robin sure sure of course I mean he

1196
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:40,480
was a huge star then I was 19 I was in a

1197
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,559
comedy club I was at where uh the comedy

1198
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,839
connection was uh

1199
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,480
originally and the guy who ran the club

1200
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:48,079
was like Robin Williams is coming he

1201
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,359
goes go in the kitchen I don't want him

1202
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,200
to see you and because I was like I had

1203
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:55,920
all this mascara on

1204
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,480
and and I was in a leisure suit and so I

1205
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,559
just stood in this kitchen and then all

1206
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,079
of a sudden he walks into the kitchen

1207
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:03,520
and I wouldn't even look at him and he's

1208
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,720
like what are you what are you doing in

1209
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,440
the kitchen and I was like well they

1210
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,040
told me you were coming I didn't want to

1211
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,680
why didn't they want you to meet me I go

1212
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,040
I I don't

1213
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:17,000
know it was really

1214
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,960
weird so then maybe nine 10 months after

1215
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,559
that I was out in San Francisco opening

1216
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,480
for Paula Poundstone and he would start

1217
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,359
coming to my shows he's still and the

1218
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,760
character was full bore you know it was

1219
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:33,160
full bore rage and and and I was in that

1220
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:35,599
Persona and uh and he I think he thought

1221
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,960
I was going to be mean or something

1222
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,400
because I'd hear him laughing in the

1223
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,559
back of the club and then he wouldn't

1224
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:45,720
say Hi and then oddly

1225
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,720
enough uh I remember the night we first

1226
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,000
started talking and hanging out all

1227
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:54,559

00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,720
compilations of short stories

1253
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,359
interconnected by common themes

1254
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,359
including dreams labyrinths libraries

1255
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:13,839
mirrors fictional writers philosophy and

1256
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,359
religion borges's Works have contributed

1257
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:20,040
to philosophical literature and the

1258
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:23,480
fantasy genre critique Angel

1259
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:27,119
Flores the first to use the term magical

1260
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:28,799
realism to define a genre that reacted

1261
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,040
against the dominant realism and

1262
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:33,400
naturalism of the 19th century considers

1263
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,000
the beginning of the movement to be the

1264
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,400
release of borges's a universal history

1265
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,640
of infamy however some critics would

1266
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,640
consider Borges to be a predecessor and

1267
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,760
not actually a magical

1268
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:50,760
realist his late poems dialogue with

1269
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,680
such cultural figures as Spinosa cameos

1270
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,040
and I'm probably saying that wrong

1271
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,960
camelos and

1272
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,220
Vergil enough what you got out of that I

1273
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,200
uh well

1274
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:05,160
[Laughter]

1275
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,960
uh all what did I get out of that they

1276
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,520
they said that he was he created the

1277
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,640
term and then they tried to take it away

1278
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:14,079
or he created the the the form I think

1279
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,480
they're saying he created the genre ah

1280
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:19,480
by having well no used the term the term

1281
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,599
magical real well I first to use it I'm

1282
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,040
drawn to magical realism you know I

1283
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:28,319
think that's that's that's what uh

1284
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,599
interests me I think all storytelling

1285
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,240
has it outside of doing a documentary

1286
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:36,799
but because you're always

1287
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:40,240
saying what if these things happened you

1288
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,079
know and and uh you're not saying well

1289
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,799
this is the truth and and even when you

1290
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,559
go back and you make a movie that's

1291
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:49,680
that's supposed to be based on reality

1292
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:53,040
you're still changing the truth but if

1293
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,200
he he he was it the fact that he was M

1294
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,960
mixing genres and having folks that were

1295
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,160
from different time periods talking to

1296
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,720
each other that they thought that um

1297
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,319
well I don't know anything more than

1298
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,359
what I've read so far I could keep going

1299
00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:08,960
if you want sure in 1914 borges's family

1300
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:12,200
moved to Switzerland where he studied at

1301
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:15,520
Le College deiv the family traveled

1302
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:18,559
widly in Europe including stays in Spain

1303
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,640
on his return to Argentina in 1921

1304
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:24,119
Borges began publishing his poems and

1305
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,880
essays in surrealist literary journals

1306
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:30,119
he also worked as a librarian and public

1307
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,799
lecturer in 1955 he was appointed to

1308
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,920
director of the national public library

1309
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:36,760
and professor of English literature at

1310
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:40,280
the University of Buenos Ares he became

1311
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,240
completely blind by the age of 55 as he

1312
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,799
never learned Braille he became unable

1313
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,520
to read wow that's that's harsh for a

1314
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:48,760
writer for a writer yeah yeah well you

1315
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,520
didn't have to read other people's

1316
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,400
things and there was an audible back

1317
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,559
then yeah but he could just keep writing

1318
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,359
yeah Scholars have suggested that his

1319
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,000
Progressive BL helped him create

1320
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,359
Innovative literary symbols through

1321
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
imagination in 1961 he came to

1322
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:08,000
International attention when he received

1323
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,880
his first formentor prize uh which he

1324
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,119
shared with Samuel Becket in 1971 he won

1325
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,960
the Jerusalem prize his work was

1326
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,039
translated and published widely in the

1327
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,799
United States and in Europe bores

1328
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,799
himself was fluent in several languages

1329
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:25,720
he dedicated his final work the

1330
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:27,799
conspirators to the city of Geneva

1331
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,240
Switzerland

1332
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:30,520
uh I started reading that like it was

1333
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,160
going to be a Spanish word but it was

1334
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,160
just the conspir the

1335
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:39,839
conspirators uh his International

1336
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:41,799
reputation was Consolidated in the 1960s

1337
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:44,400
aided by his Works being available in

1338
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:48,200
English by the Latin American boom and

1339
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:53,359
by the success of Garcia marquez's 100

1340
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:56,880
Years of Solitude writer and essayist JM

1341
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,520
goet or Ki said of him

1342
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,200
he more than anyone renovated the

1343
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:04,200
language of fiction and thus opened the

1344
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,640
way to a remarkable generation of

1345
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,280
Spanish American novelists that's all

1346
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,400
I've got well so clearly he was a bit of

1347
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,359
a surrealist if he was up there compared

1348
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:19,039
to Beckett and uh that he dabbled in

1349
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:22,280
magical realism or this is the guy For

1350
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,799
Better or Worse who gave us

1351
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,319
ComicCon that's that's what I've learned

1352
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,359
today

1353
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,039
um I have a paragraph uh from him would

1354
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:33,000
you mind uh reading it sure I now

1355
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,039
consider hell the dictionary tells us

1356
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,839
that hell is dogma and the Christian

1357
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:40,480
Church did not invent these brutalities

1358
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,599
it implies that Christianity attracts

1359
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,680
all the truths it finds in false

1360
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:47,640
religions I'm not referring to the

1361
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,640
simplistic mythology of dung Roasters

1362
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,839
fire and tongs I'm speaking Eternal

1363
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,839
punishment for the wicked Gibbon writes

1364
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:57,200
that the two vulgar ingredients of fire

1365
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:59,520
and darkness are suff ient to create a

1366
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,079
sensation of pain that can be

1367
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,319
exaggerated infinitely by the idea of

1368
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,920
duration Without End this proves that

1369
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:09,480
the creation of infernos is easy the

1370
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,480
attribute of Eternity is horrifying

1371
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,119
continuity the fact that the Divine

1372
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:17,240
persecution lacks intervals that in Hell

1373
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:19,640
there is no rest is even more horrifying

1374
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,799
but imagining it is impossible writers

1375
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,440
who expound on Hell dishonor their

1376
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:26,760
imagination and their

1377
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,319
decency I like the dis dishonoring of

1378
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:33,640
the imagination wow I think so what he's

1379
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:37,680
saying is that there can't be hell if

1380
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:40,000
you're not given coffee

1381
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,839
breaks and the coffee breaks themselves

1382
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,119
might be a hell in themselves but here's

1383
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:50,119
the thing that is true like if you're

1384
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:56,319
in uh this infinite torture and you just

1385
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:58,200
is constant without a break where you go

1386
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:00,200
oh and then they go back yeah it's just

1387
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,160
you're just it's just a different it's

1388
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,440
just reality yeah yeah it's just

1389
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,480
constant pain that would just uh I guess

1390
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,440
I don't know if you get even if you

1391
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,440
don't get used to it it' just be where

1392
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,559
what what what life is you know it

1393
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,520
wouldn't be anything other than just

1394
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:19,280
this thing I mean maybe maybe that's

1395
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,799
what modern life is yeah I was I was

1396
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,400
thinking about how like it seems like

1397
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,920
you're having a breather now from from

1398
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,559
like the tortured Bobcat of of the ' 80s

1399
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,119
and 90s that's true I mean that's and

1400
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:36,359
that's storytelling you know if if you

1401
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:38,440
if you pack the 90 minutes only with uh

1402
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:41,119
it has to ebb and flow there's there

1403
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:43,720
it's the the rhythm of telling a story

1404
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,359
the rhythm of of a punchline the rhythm

1405
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,640
of of making people laugh or cry or or

1406
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:52,079
any feel anything you know you there has

1407
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,319
to be the absence of in the story so

1408
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,760
people can fill it in with their head

1409
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,720
and once they fill it in then they're

1410
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,760
engag engaged and if you don't if you're

1411
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,440
not asking them to engage and and try to

1412
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,440
second guess what's going on and try to

1413
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,359
figure it out they're not that's why I

1414
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,119
think like I go to movies now and and it

1415
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:12,760
sounds like an old guy saying get off my

1416
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:15,000
lawn but there's this assault of imagery

1417
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:17,839
that doesn't give my brain I think if

1418
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,559
you were raised in video games and

1419
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,920
things that doesn't doesn't give me a

1420
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:25,039
chance

1421
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:28,880
to comprehend what I'm watching it comes

1422
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:30,880
at such an Assa all that I don't know if

1423
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,599
I I think other people are assimilating

1424
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,079
it and it's working for them it just

1425
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:38,319
doesn't for me I'm just questioning if

1426
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:39,960
there's storytelling going on well are

1427
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:42,480
do you go see them often are you going

1428
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,000
there I no I don't go there to be mad

1429
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,799
like what will happen is someone say you

1430
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,559
should see it it's not that bad and then

1431
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:51,039
I'll see it and I go oh I didn't get

1432
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,839
this right you know yeah I think there

1433
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:55,359
it's just a lot of flashy flashing

1434
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:57,880
lights and and and explosions more or

1435
01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:01,160
less yeah there's it makes sense that

1436
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:03,400
why it does well uh all around the

1437
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,000
world it makes perfect nobody has the

1438
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,240
attention fan anymore it's like you know

1439
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,680
it's like a Snapchat world now so it's

1440
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:12,440
like you see things and they're gone and

1441
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,640
and that's kind of like you know

1442
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,480
going going back to the memory I don't

1443
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,000
think anybody's going to be remembered

1444
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,520
no no not

1445
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,200
unless not unless I get blown up even

1446
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,880
then like people will forget everything

1447
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,440
I don't think this like the next gener

1448
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,559
generation's memory is just going to be

1449
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,000
like you

1450
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:35,039
know TR ourselves to not have a memory

1451
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,240
yeah we don't I don't need to Ian I can

1452
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,599
look it up on my iPhone right yeah but

1453
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,599
it's it's really just like creating

1454
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,960
things and they evaporate and like I was

1455
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,400
thinking about that with Snapchat like

1456
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,880
Snapchat and and a movie are kind of the

1457
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:53,480
same thing look at how much money and

1458
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:55,039
time and work and people go into a movie

1459
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,119
and then there's like a billion movies

1460
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,680
on Netflix that don't even like I don't

1461
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,319
even get to scroll past them right I

1462
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,680
like that's like that's years and hopes

1463
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,599
and dreams of people's lives right it

1464
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,680
may as well just be a Snapchat photo

1465
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:10,760
that that dissolved a few seconds later

1466
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,680
well it's interesting because there was

1467
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:16,880
an anxiety that we used to have we go

1468
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:19,000
into u a video store and couldn't and I

1469
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,200
wouldn't walk out with a title because

1470
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,400
it was so

1471
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:27,079
overwhelming I don't think on the way I

1472
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,599
watch stuff now when I go to Netflix

1473
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:31,559
I I guess I do eventually pick out

1474
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,720
something that's the difference I guess

1475
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:38,319
before I I would actually

1476
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:41,520
get I would flip out and not

1477
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:44,319
go I don't watch a lot of stuff um and

1478
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,640
it's not because I'm a snob it's um

1479
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:49,160
partially I I

1480
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,119
just you know I get it like I'll watch a

1481
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,559
couple episodes or something and I go oh

1482
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,799
this is really well done but I just

1483
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,880
won't get hooked in MH I don't think I'm

1484
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:59,039
going to lead this it's just uh once I

1485
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,720
see how it's done I go oh this is cool

1486
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,359
and and you already know the trick yeah

1487
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,319
or just like it's like oh I get it and

1488
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:07,200
then there's shows that aren't made for

1489
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:09,760
me you know right it' would be weird if

1490
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,880
I couldn't wait for the next Broad City

1491
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,079
as a 53y old

1492
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,240
dude I'm laughing and at the same time

1493
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,680
thinking man I like Broad City but oh

1494
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,200
really like I watch it and I and I

1495
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,480
laughed and everything but I also felt

1496
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,680
like it's a little creepy that I'm

1497
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,119
watching this like like I felt like this

1498
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:29,119
old dude

1499
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:32,200
it was too it wasn't offensive it was

1500
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:35,200
more like oh this is really personal and

1501
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:38,240
uh and um and I don't I don't think

1502
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,240
Grandpa should be watching

1503
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:44,200
it w see theot it's so funny that you

1504
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,279
see yourself as this old man and well I

1505
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,839
do and then I I I joke about it and then

1506
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:50,960
I see myself and I go wow you're old but

1507
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:53,039
but the people I work with and my

1508
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,640
friends are a lot of them are much

1509
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,799
younger than me and the ideas that

1510
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,359
interest me yeah it's weird but I didn't

1511
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,559
think of you as an old person until you

1512
01:03:58,359 --> 01:04:02,000
kept insisting that you were one yeah I

1513
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,520
was like oh yeah I guess he is old well

1514
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,160
I'm just kind of pissed about that you

1515
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:08,559
know I've kind of dialed in what I want

1516
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,520
to do and now I'm going ah there's a

1517
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,200
finite amount of time left but you know

1518
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,680
what else though I think you were so

1519
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:18,720
huge at one point yeah that it almost

1520
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:20,319
feels like you lived a whole life that I

1521
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,440
think there are guys your age who have

1522
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:25,279
kind of had an even kill existence up

1523
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,920
until now they feel a lot younger yeah

1524
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:28,880
but you true and then there are guys who

1525
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,880
blew up huge and they're still like

1526
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,880
riding high on top but you've lived like

1527
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,240
three realities well you know it's it's

1528
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,400
interesting I I was directing you know I

1529
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,720
work on Mark Maron show I direct a lot

1530
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:46,039
of the episodes and and I did one with

1531
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:48,440
um uh Ray Romano and

1532
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:51,359
uh you know there was a time in my life

1533
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:54,039
I'd look at ry's life and what he had

1534
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:56,640
and thought well why you know I should

1535
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:59,000
have done a sick or I should have

1536
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,680
figured it out or I or I wonder if I

1537
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,200
could have ever done that and you know

1538
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,559
all those kind of things but we were

1539
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,119
sitting there in between setups in this

1540
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:11,000
garage just him and I and I was talking

1541
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:14,640
to him and and we were talking about the

1542
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,599
same kind of things that

1543
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:21,039
and and it was just like in in a good

1544
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:22,799
way and not that his life is not a good

1545
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,079
life but it was like oh I didn't miss

1546
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:27,240
anything it was kind of cool cuz he was

1547
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,359
just going you know what are you up to

1548
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,599
now I go well I make these movies oh you

1549
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:34,880
know and he was talking to me about my

1550
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:37,640
movies and it was just funny it was like

1551
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,480
um matter it didn't matter at all NE

1552
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,720
neither of us were any happier and both

1553
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,160
of us were interesting making stuff you

1554
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,720
know I I you know I was really hoping he

1555
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,480
would be a jerk you

1556
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,119
know because everybody just says nice

1557
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,200
things about the guy and then and then

1558
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,319
he I was like oh come on and then and

1559
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,680
then he was he was a really good guy

1560
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:00,680
so let's take a look at quotes okay

1561
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,880
let's do it to make punishment Eternal

1562
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:06,039
is to make evil Eternal God cannot will

1563
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,920
that Eternity for his

1564
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:10,599
Universe I think it's kind of what we

1565
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:14,520
were saying before like without good

1566
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:17,960
there is no bad so if there's no end to

1567
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,000
evil God canot will that Eternity for

1568
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:23,440
his universe so God will not say there

1569
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,599
will be evil for the rest of

1570
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,319
time you know the and I'm not trying to

1571
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:31,599
be cynical I'm just having a hard time

1572
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:34,799
wrapping my brain around his he it seems

1573
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,279
like he's wrestling with God he wants

1574
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:38,400
there to be a God he just doesn't want

1575
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:40,160
there to be a hell that I think he wants

1576
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,200
there to be more

1577
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:46,920
consistency he wants hell to be but I

1578
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:50,880
think the argument against him from a

1579
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:53,960
god believer's point of view is that God

1580
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,160
controls time so whatever is infinite

1581
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:59,839
and whatever is finite would be up to

1582
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,720
God so just because you can't understand

1583
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:04,559
it doesn't mean God can't do it cuz if

1584
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:07,279
God is God then why can't God do that

1585
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,520
you just have a limited understanding of

1586
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:13,640
of time right and if God created time

1587
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:16,119
then he can bend it like Silly Putty

1588
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,440
however he wants and it wouldn't make a

1589
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:20,640
difference Eternal punishment proves

1590
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,599
that there is no venial sin all Faults

1591
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:26,039
Are

1592
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:27,799
unpardonable so a venial and mortal sin

1593
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:31,079
do you know those terms I only know

1594
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:34,119
mortal what's a venial venial uh is one

1595
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:37,240
that you can um you can

1596
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:39,720
erase you can say oh I'm sorry but IM

1597
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,480
mortal that that's that's that's in yeah

1598
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,440
yeah you can't you're locked in yeah you

1599
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,920
can't you're going to hell so there's

1600
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:49,119
nothing like that in Judaism either you

1601
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,599
can't they're different there's no JV

1602
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,720
Varsity sin no I mean as long as you

1603
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,920
exist you can repent that's not bad

1604
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:59,599
otherwise you wouldn't be here the only

1605
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:02,200
point to be to be here is is because you

1606
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,520
can you can improve is because you can

1607
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:07,480
grow and you wouldn't be here if it was

1608
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:12,279
too getting a whole new idea on on on

1609
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:15,040
the on the faith of you know I I

1610
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:18,080
always

1611
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:21,440
assumed that it was there it was more

1612
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:24,120
Dooms Day it seems like Christianity is

1613
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,960
a little more doomsday than uh than

1614
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,520
Judaism Judaism yeah you know I always

1615
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,920
wind up talking about Judaism I guess

1616
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,279
it's cuz it's a big part that's who you

1617
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,679
are I me yeah yeah but I I remember you

1618
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,040
know every time I go into one of these

1619
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,920
I'm like I don't need to bring up

1620
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:42,080
Judi yeah but you know it's it's how you

1621
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:46,719
perceive the world you know no matter

1622
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:51,040
how what you take away from it now or or

1623
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:53,120
you know but that's that's uh uh yeah I

1624
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,480
guess Christianity is just is more

1625
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,600
Droopy Dog you know it's like it'll

1626
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,600
never work you

1627
01:09:01,159 --> 01:09:06,239
know that's why it get it's a little

1628
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:08,799
nerve-wracking when when when people

1629
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:11,279
believe in the ends of times get close

1630
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:14,239
to the button you know when elected

1631
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:17,279
official believes that the we're in the

1632
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:19,040
end days that's terrifying it's also

1633
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,080
pretty cool that with all the crazy

1634
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,480
different beliefs out there that the

1635
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:26,199
world is still yeah like there's some

1636
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,719
weird balance be you know everybody has

1637
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:30,679
all these such extreme different ways of

1638
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,880
seeing the world and every now and then

1639
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:34,400
somebody gets to navigate the ship with

1640
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,000
a different belief and somehow we're

1641
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,400
still we're still we haven't yeah I

1642
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,719
think it is kind of uh it's it's

1643
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:46,799
dangerous when people believe they're

1644
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:49,520
God is mad at an entire you know uh

1645
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:52,000
Faith ideology government group of

1646
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,279
people that's not only dangerous that's

1647
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,120
really well it's beyond danger you know

1648
01:09:54,279 --> 01:10:00,719
that that's that's a um projection I

1649
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,080
think yeah it's just people projecting

1650
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,000
God into well we don't like you so God

1651
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:08,840
doesn't like it yeah and also it's just

1652
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,719
you know it's most human interactions

1653
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:13,199
are you know based on some sort of fear

1654
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:14,760
you know am I going to be liked am I

1655
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,679
going to get hurt am I going to get

1656
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:19,640
killed yeah you know and when you're on

1657
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,400
stage and you get to that point where

1658
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,679
you're genuinely ad living and you there

1659
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:27,320
is no you're not even sure where the end

1660
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:30,560
of the thoughts going and it and it and

1661
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:33,480
it and it lands that's there's nothing

1662
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,800
that can that's the that's and I don't

1663
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,719
you know that doesn't happen every time

1664
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,199
I go on stage but when that does happen

1665
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,960
there there's nothing like that you know

1666
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:44,800
to be talking out of your ass and all of

1667
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:46,080
a sudden it not only does it not only

1668
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,280
does it get a laugh but it actually

1669
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:51,080
makes sense you know that's that's so so

1670
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:54,120
for someone who says he's

1671
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,880
an agnostic agnostic I I I think that

1672
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,679
sometimes when those ideas happen I I

1673
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,320
feel like they almost already exist and

1674
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,520
I'm just grabbing them and and pulling

1675
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:04,400
them down you're tapping into the cosmos

1676
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,520
or maybe it was already even in my head

1677
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,719
yeah on how religion is used for

1678
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,960
political manipulation there is the

1679
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:14,239
concept that there is the destroyer of

1680
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:17,280
all others I speak not of evil whose

1681
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:19,040
limit is that of Ethics I speak of the

1682
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,960
infinite and we were just talking about

1683
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,960
that yeah we beat him to the punch

1684
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:28,280
yeah yeah

1685
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,920
I'd be interested to see what his what

1686
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:33,840
his

1687
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:35,920
um what his essays are because it seems

1688
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,719
like as a philosopher he's mostly

1689
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,120
remembered because he questioned the

1690
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:41,239
existence of

1691
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,800
hell I think I don't know if this is the

1692
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:45,199
only thing he's remembered for if this

1693
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,600
is just the piece that this this is what

1694
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:49,000
his okay yeah that's that's the other

1695
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,639
thing when I when I did goes through the

1696
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,199
Alex filter it goes through the Alex

1697
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:54,560
filter this could just be like one of

1698
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:56,560
many different things he could just he

1699
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,080
could had a couple beers in him yeah he

1700
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,560
just might have picked this piece cuz it

1701
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,960
worked with the

1702
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,639
fire did you ever go back on a Tonight

1703
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,719
Show after that yeah actually I was back

1704
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:08,719
on then the following week I did a skit

1705
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,920
for them but it's interesting like in

1706
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,320
the zygus you know when I'm ego suring

1707
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,719
on the internet it'll say that I was

1708
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:19,480
banned from The Tonight Show I like no I

1709
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:21,400
I wasn't I think you want me to be maybe

1710
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,040
it's just a better story like that yeah

1711
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,480
it is it's just kind of interesting

1712
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,520
though it's just you know if the

1713
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:30,760
internet's had me married to people I

1714
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:34,120
haven't been married to and I mean it's

1715
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:36,800
nice to be gossiped about I guess versus

1716
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,159
not being but again it it we went full

1717
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,440
circle on how you're going to be

1718
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:43,920
remembered and you're powerless over

1719
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:46,520
that so you should have a good time yeah

1720
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,880
it's amazing I I mean just I I don't

1721
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,600
know what it's like to be at that level

1722
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,880
of Fame where people are like you know

1723
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,760
what he's married to this woman they

1724
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:58,159
just put it together for you it's

1725
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:02,320
you know Tom Kenny say you have all the

1726
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:03,639
um all the pits of success and not a lot

1727
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,480
of the

1728
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:09,159
benefits which is not true but it was

1729
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,560
just it's just sometimes you know it's

1730
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:14,800
it's it's a funny line anyway but it's

1731
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,920
true to an extent but but it but I'm but

1732
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:19,800
I'm very

1733
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:24,719
happy um creating stuff working stuff

1734
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:28,280
paying my bills and um connecting with a

1735
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:30,719
new audience you know not just the the

1736
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:32,400
I'm connecting you know when I play Rock

1737
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,520
clubs it's much younger folks that come

1738
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:38,080
out and they you know a lot of them

1739
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:40,440
weren't even born when I was a big deal

1740
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:43,080
so so I do see things turning and it's

1741
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,000
not as uh it's not as depressing as I

1742
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,120
make it sound I think what'll happen is

1743
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,560
you'll get more and more vulnerable and

1744
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,440
open with people and and the and they'll

1745
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,920
get to know the real you and as soon as

1746
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,480
they expect that you'll come back out

1747
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:57,560
screaming yeah I think so they the other

1748
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:59,679
night I did that at crab apples I was
