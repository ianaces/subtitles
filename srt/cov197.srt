it's a it's a pleasure um I've I've been

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,920
uh nerding out uh listening to previous

13
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,320
episodes so it's it's a lot of fun to

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,079
finally be able to talk uh in part of

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,680
the

16
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,600
conversation well I hope you haven't

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,039
been listening to super early episodes

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,520
if you have I apologize uh you know

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,920
thoroughly oh it's podcasting that's the

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
world you know oh my God I mean I've

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,000
been doing it for almost six years now

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,399
but it's a world of difference I mean

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
you know but it's uh you you I sound

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,280
like a child at the beginning I'm like I

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,439
just we have no idea what we're doing um

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,880
and we've luckily uh this this episode

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,200
can go up a lot quicker because I don't

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,880
have to edit it because we have done

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,479
this album before but it's been a while

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,400
since we've talked about it and I it'd

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,040
be fun to get your fresh perspective on

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,280
it but before we do that you do have

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
something to promote so let's get that

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,200
out of the way I like to get that out of

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,040
the way uh if if people have a time

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,000
sensitive stuff so oh sure uh I am

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,079
starting a Kickstarter because I would

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,360
like to put

39
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,040
a moon

40
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,680
base on Jupiter oh wow I haven't figured

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,000
everything out yet sure um yeah but that

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,320
that's my plan is to build a base on the

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,880
moon may I suggest then take that to

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,399
Jupiter oh okay see that was going to be

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,799
my next question I was like well you

46
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,680
would normally you might refer to that

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,280
as a Jupiter base but you have decided

48
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,840
specifically you want it to the specs of

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
the moon but then you want to transfer

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,880
it to Jupiter and see what happens

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,759
exactly okay well that's fine I'm I'm

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,360
excited to see what's your goal right

53
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,360
now uh$ 13 billion 13 billion okay and

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,119
when does this start with and that's

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
with three question marks at the

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,200
end I didn't know Kickstarter allowed

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,840
you to do that that's great it's

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,480
difficult it's difficult uh I just

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,280
coughed into the microphone uh but you

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,080
do have a movie oh yeah um that's one I

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,879
meant specifically oh all right there's

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,560
also a a a documentary film called be a

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,920
man um and that is uh coming out on uh

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,160
October 7th mhm um on iTunes Amazon and

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,879
all of the digital webscape and uh I'm

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,560
very excited it feels like it's finally

67
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,319
going to exist that's awesome and tell

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,840
the audience a little bit about it I and

69
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,000
I apologize I did not get to watch it

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,680
yet I really want to but I you know I'm

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,440
not going to lie no it's totally fine I

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,599
think I spoiled the ending with the with

73
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,879
the Moonbase

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,840
tease because that's what it it's

75
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,840
originally it was going to be called

76
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,400
build a moon

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,519
base and we had some uh we had some

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,040
issues with that I guess uh JJ Abrams um

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,840
already copyrighted that oh wow yeah

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,200
he's got his hands in so many different

81
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,040
pies yeah he he sent me an email and he

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,560
said I already mailed that to myself so

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,239
you are s o and um and I was like s so

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,799
sounds like a stepdad phrase it really

85
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,799
does and I am now I'm sorry I'm riffing

86
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:27,680
way too much uh so be a man uh long

87
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:31,439
story short my uh my childhood was uh

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,680
sans's men uh I I grew up with my mother

89
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,519
my grandmother and my great-grandmother

90
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,439
I never had any men in my life and then

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,319
um cut to uh being an adult uh and and

92
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,200
being married and having a house and

93
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,720
then my wife told me she was pregnant

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,720
and I had a an existential crisis um I

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,439
panicked because I didn't know how to be

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,280
a dad or what that even looks like

97
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,040
because I never had had one growing up

98
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,959
so I decided to do all of these manly

99
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,280
things that I thought made you a man

100
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,599
when I was a little kid

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,400
and um so I set out to kind of take that

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,280
journey and uh and the documentary uh

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,159
follows that Journey well see now I'm

104
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,799
even more excited to see it um that's

105
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,319
fantastic and I like that you picked an

106
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,479
album with man in the title I didn't

107
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,320
realize it until I was maybe like

108
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,600
halfway through Rel listening and I was

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,520
like oh this is actually there's a good

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,440
portion of this album that is um

111
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,400
mirroring a lot of my own internal

112
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,440
struggle uhhuh of masculinity and

113
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,800
because I I don't know I'm you know it's

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,240
2016 I am

115
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,520
33 um so I grew up in that era where I

116
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,080
was raised with um like Roseanne and and

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,000
you know Wonder Years and things like

118
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,840
that that's those were the men that I

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,080
saw and as I grew up it turned into like

120
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,080
MacGyver and Magnum

121
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,199
PI and so then I was stuck as a stunted

122
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,360
manboy trying to figure things out

123
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,120
before my son was born and I was like

124
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,080
okay so I'm going to do the fighting and

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:08,280
the drinking and the cars and um and

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,240
it's it's insane the the the journey was

127
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,919
fascinating and terrifying at the same

128
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,639
time um you know I thought I would do I

129
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,160
thought I I thought I would do funny

130
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,800
things you know being a comedian and and

131
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,199
being put in situations I was like oh

132
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,759
this will be funny right and then every

133
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,560
time it was being

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,240
confronted with uh with this weird

135
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,919
Middle School thing that was inside me

136
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,520
like this tiny little little person

137
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,400
inside me was like oh no all of these

138
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,319
things are getting dredged back up and

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,240
so I went from being you know a pacifist

140
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,319
to being uh just standing in a boxing

141
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,759
ring with Vinnie Penza five time world

142
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,639
champion boxer oh my God and uh and

143
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,080
apparently I had pissed him off by

144
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,319
asking him to do this and so that did

145
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,560
not go well and just getting to relive

146
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,560
some fun childhood stuff uh riding

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,280
around in a in a laan uh from the back

148
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,199
to the future movies that was fantastic

149
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,039
and and you know talk to a lot of great

150
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,520
comics and it's it's fun it's a love

151
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,919
letter to my son and and it's very funny

152
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,120
and um I'm excited for it to exist

153
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:18,479
that's awesome um but moon bases uhhuh

154
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,680
yeah yeah yeah moon bases are what's

155
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,000
important that is why we're here kids um

156
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,840
so my God so I'm looking through the

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,240
track listing again of of this album so

158
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,319
it's 1995 so you're you're a few years

159
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,800
younger than me my guess is you didn't

160
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,960
hear this when it was released but or am

161
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,759
I totally

162
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,560
wrong um I don't remember when it hit me

163
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,240
and I think that's that's probably

164
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:47,000
something that uh most people uh say I I

165
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,680
I want to say I think I came across this

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,039
I was in high school and um I came

167
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,160
across it in a in a bookstore which is I

168
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,000
think where you should come across like

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,440
Fringe comedy oh yeah is in a bookstore

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,720
and uh and saw the CD and it blew my

171
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,960
mind I was like wait this Bruce Mulla

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,280
from Kids in the Hall has an album right

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,240
and I thought it was going to be standup

174
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,639
right sure and so I I paid for it and I

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
and I went home and I was so excited to

176
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,560
listen to it and the first time like

177
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
from the first track I went oh this is

178
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,840
very

179
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,000
different and um and but I was hooked

180
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,000
like immediately I I think normally

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,479
something like that would turn me

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,440
off in what way well I think it comes

183
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,479
across uh oh boy like if you aren't

184
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,400
immediately sold on Kids in the Hall

185
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:41,080
sure okay yeah I think it can come

186
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,280
across incredibly precious oh definitely

187
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,879
definitely I I remember when somebody

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,319
first uh I think it was benac or

189
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
thrilling adventure hour he's the one

190
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,479
who uh first picked this for the show

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,120
and we listened to it and I'm like I

192
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,240
love Kids in the Hall and I especially

193
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,360
love Bruce McCulla but I'm like holy

194
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,199
[ __ ] this is just like this is a 20s

195
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,000
something making an album about a 20

196
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,840
something brain a particularly brilliant

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,240
20-some but like he's he's he's just

198
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,919
this is what it's like to make an art

199
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,039
project is what it feels like so I

200
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,800
completely understand what you're saying

201
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,280
yeah but I think I like I wasn't even in

202
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,599
college at the time and and so I was I

203
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,240
was primed to have the The Angst and the

204
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,080
sense of having already judged the world

205
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,039
and found it

206
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,560
wanting so I was prepared to be like yes

207
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,399
this is what it is this is give me more

208
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,880
of your reality yeah and I I do partic

209
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm sorry I I do particularly like his

210
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,800
his point of view and and the fact that

211
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,959
that is mixed it's so dripping in irony

212
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,200
while at the same time being having this

213
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,920
sincere cynicism to it if that makes any

214
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,920
sense I think there's a

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,600
beautiful um tragedy in throughout the

216
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,200
whole thing I think the subtext of

217
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
everything

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,200
is I I was thinking about it earlier and

219
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,399
it's like it's this idea of everyone

220
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,720
being a victim of

221
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,720
circumstance from the the very very rich

222
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,680
to the very very poor um you're just

223
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,279
stuck wherever you are yeah either in a

224
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,839
relationship there's a lot of like

225
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:25,959
angsty break upy feeling in in the film

226
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,839
film in the album in the sound film and

227
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:32,079
um there's the but there's also this

228
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,640
this hope to it that comes across like a

229
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,360
like a minimum wage hero yeah like he's

230
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
going to don't worry we're all stuck in

231
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,839
this crappy job but you're going to

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,680
you're going to love these tiny Quiet

233
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:47,839
Moments yeah I I I I the more I think

234
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,240
about it and the more I W you know and

235
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm always going to be comparing this to

236
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,120
what I see on Kids in the Hall uh just

237
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,959
because that was my first exposure to

238
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,120
him I feel like I don't know I'm I'm I'm

239
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,160
trying to Peg where he's going to fall

240
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,800
at the end of his career and what he's

241
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,880
going to mean to the world of Comedy

242
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,279
because he's somehow in one of the most

243
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
popular sketch groups of all time but

244
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,360
like you say Fringe is a very good word

245
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,640
for what this album is it's its own

246
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,040
thing completely yeah and from what I

247
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,800
understand of of like articles I've read

248
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,560
and and interviews and things like that

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,959
he's definitely I read his Memoir as

250
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,160
well um he's especially at that time he

251
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:32,160
was just running away from any semblance

252
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,120
of uh normal and and

253
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,279
expectation and so I think part of this

254
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,839
is is that sense of just well I'll put

255
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,360
something out that I only I want to hear

256
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,920
y yeah and then people embraced it and

257
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,639
he was like oh no and and then he did um

258
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,600
the the drunk baby project and uh and I

259
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,720
still love that as well yeah so I think

260
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,279
there's a that's a very Bruce Mulla

261
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,079
thing like let me oh you want to like me

262
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,440
then prove that you want to like me

263
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:03,480
right yeah and there and there's that

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,800
tone throughout the whole thing there's

265
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,160
that tone in his acting even there are

266
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,360
times when I feel like he is pushing me

267
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,120
to either not enjoy him or really

268
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,279
appreciate what he's doing to push me

269
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,040
and and that is such a struggle to be a

270
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,360
fan of him like I I am a tried and true

271
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,959
like deep in my bones fan of Bruce

272
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,880
McCulla I mean Kids in the Hall is my

273
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,320
biggest influence of uh just having a

274
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,680
sense of humor and what I find funny and

275
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,079
I always loved the um like the absurdity

276
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,959
of reality that Kids in the Hall showed

277
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:41,920
and and you know Finding very very tiny

278
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:44,639
mundane things and and just expanding

279
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:49,120
and expanding and expanding until the

280
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,000
most normal thing becomes just crazy and

281
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,959
uh you know I would watch Kids in the

282
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Hall thinking oh I love this tone I love

283
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,120
uh what they are doing and what they are

284
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,800
saying and I think listening to the

285
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,959
album was the first time I realized oh

286
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,880
that that's not a tone that the show has

287
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,839
the show is a collection of five

288
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,680
different people's very specific uh

289
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,560
sense of humor and Bruce is is I think

290
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,199
it's just it's that base tone that that

291
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,920
everything carries through it's true

292
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:23,000
yeah that that is one reason why while

293
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,440
the show is still rewatchable it is I it

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,320
is one of those things that I can't

295
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,399
really passively watch I can passively

296
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,000
absorb like a Monty Python cuz I love M

297
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,160
python but this this if if we're going

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
to Kids in the Hall I it's I have to

299
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,440
actively watch and be ready to watch and

300
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,399
that could just be my brain but it is so

301
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,720
it's it's jarring from one sketch to the

302
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,360
next even if they're sort of connected

303
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
because there's all those voices there

304
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,399
and the fact that the guy who made this

305
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,800
album is also the guy with a cabbage for

306
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,959
a head is at this same time like it it

307
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,399
makes sense but it also feels like there

308
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,800
there's almost this thing of

309
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,399
specifically with a sketch like that

310
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,519
that is obviously making fun of a lot of

311
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,399
different tropes in sketch while it's

312
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,279
making fun of those tropes it's also I

313
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,560
feel like I feel like there's a part of

314
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,320
him as the pretentious 20-some that he

315
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,600
was that was like well are you laughing

316
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,519
at me or are you laughing at the wrong

317
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,040
thing like it just does feel like a test

318
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,199
no matter what and while I I I kind of

319
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,920
like that challenge personally it's I

320
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,600
can see why it might turn some people

321
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,959
off oh yeah I think I think something

322
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:37,360
like this is such a oh it's a it's a

323
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:39,680
very academic Pursuit and um I don't I

324
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,639
don't know why it hit me the way it did

325
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,199
when I first heard maybe because it was

326
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:49,000
so different um I think it I think it

327
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,959
fits in a different time um you know

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,279
that kind of the the spoken word um

329
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:58,160
sensibility to it I think fits in an

330
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:01,759
earlier kind of exploratory comedy World

331
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,920
um I'm thinking like uh like fire sign

332
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,320
theater like the the more theatrical

333
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,360
kind of Radio based comedy and then Here

334
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,240
Comes This Album from uh basically like

335
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,360
the grunge comedy

336
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,839
troop um that is is very unexpected yeah

337
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,240
no absolutely I if if uh if we're you

338
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,839
know i' honestly I'd never heard anybody

339
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,600
refer to them as grunge comedy but I do

340
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,120
feel like at least in terms of period

341
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,120
that's absolutely perfect and in terms

342
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,000
of aesthetic cuz they're not Punk they

343
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,920
they have a punk aesthetic to them in

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,519
that and probably all because of Bruce

345
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,279
cab but uh yeah there is definitely that

346
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,199
yeah I think it's gr because I think

347
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,240
Punk would be I think everybody in the

348
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,800
troop would if if they were surrounded

349
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,839
by like a punk kind of Ideal they'd be

350
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,240
like it's a little loud in here yeah

351
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,040
it's absolutely true it's it's that

352
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,519
would be too that would not be Canadian

353
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,880
enough this is this is absolutely

354
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,639
perfectly Canadian at the same time um

355
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,759
yeah yeah and ironically I mean you have

356
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:06,720
uh vigil on the album and you know the

357
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:10,720
it's a kind of Ode to the Seattle scene

358
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,240
when KK Cobain killed himself and um I

359
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,639
REM oh that's how I got oh my God so I

360
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,320
got the I got the CD and I was super

361
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:21,440
excited that I had the CD and I had my

362
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,120
first computer and uh cuz yeah that's

363
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,279
right around the right time I had my

364
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,199
first computer so I I burned the CD on

365
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,040
my computer I you know just I ripped it

366
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,639
there and I would listen to it on my

367
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,519
computer and it screwed up the track uh

368
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,199
listing so vigil was always the first

369
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,839
thing that came up and that's how I was

370
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,240
introduced to the album was that that

371
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,480
was the first track and I was like this

372
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,839
isn't even really funny this is right

373
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,680
this is just heartfelt and sad and and

374
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,040
it's but beautiful yeah and um and I

375
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,759
still listen to that and and and I'm

376
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,920
impressed with it and I feel like oh

377
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,880
this album just is a perfect sales pitch

378
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,319
for why Bruce McCulla needs to write um

379
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,839
like essay formed no like just give me

380
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,759
books that are just tons and tons of

381
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,519
short stories and n and like little uh

382
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,000
essays and and things like that and I

383
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,399
will just devour all of them yeah he

384
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,040
yeah and the more I'm thinking about it

385
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm trying to figure out what his I I

386
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,319
want to know I something like that would

387
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,519
be perfect because I would like to know

388
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,040
what his evolution has been mentally as

389
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,680
a comedian because I mean he's even

390
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,319
talked about recently how he's you know

391
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,120
I've calmed down a bit since I was in my

392
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:40,279
20s but like has he I want to know

393
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,600
because he's made some real you know and

394
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,120
I don't mean this in an insulting way

395
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
some real pedestrian stuff since then

396
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,199
but it's it's money-making stuff I do

397
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,920
want to know I want to know creatively

398
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,680
where this guy's brain is at right now

399
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,120
like if he were to do a new album today

400
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,560
what is that what does that become is it

401
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,160
now I actually speaking of which I have

402
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,839
not heard drunk baby project so how does

403
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,199
it

404
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,640
compare how similar or different are

405
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:09,400
they um I think it's more musical okay

406
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,520
than uh than shame based man uh and

407
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,079
there's a couple of tracks on there that

408
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,240
I tend to skip okay uh because once I

409
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,039
think they're more once you get the the

410
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,360
initial joke it's like okay this was

411
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,559
great and then let's move on to the next

412
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,480
one okay but there's some stuff on there

413
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,799
that's really really great um uh I'm

414
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,400
struggling to come up with an example

415
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,600
because they're mostly songs sure sure

416
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,640
but uh yeah there's some fantastic stuff

417
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,720
on there and um it's still great it's

418
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,760
still very good um but like I did some

419
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,360
reading and uh I guess sham based man

420
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,559
kind of went on a print and fans were

421
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,200
asking Bruce where they could get uh

422
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,160
shame based man he's like I don't know I

423
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,559
can't even get it myself so he released

424
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,440
uh drunk baby project on his own wow you

425
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,159
know in answer to that well here now you

426
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,640
can get this that's great so yeah

427
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,320
there's that sense of and I think with

428
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,400
something like a shame based man or a

429
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,200
drunk baby project they're

430
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,520
so they're so uh just in a passing

431
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,480
moment they're so tied to a very

432
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,320
specific moment in his life in the

433
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,919
listener's life and and you know you're

434
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,080
creating these these collections of

435
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,000
little sketches or songs or you know

436
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,760
poems whatever um I think that I think

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,880
each one of those albums would be compl

438
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,679
completely different even 6 months

439
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,679
later yeah like oh I really like this

440
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,559
part but I had I had a better thing come

441
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:43,440
into my head you know a week later yeah

442
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:44,960
that's a good point um do you so in

443
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,960
relising to I don't know how recently

444
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,559
you relisten to it but do you have you

445
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,440
probably don't even need to do you have

446
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:55,159
a favorite track off of the whole thing

447
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,240
uh I I did relisten to it last night and

448
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,159
um I I do it occasionally I feel like I

449
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,080
need to there are moments where I'm like

450
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:06,240
I need to get back to certain comedy

451
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,760
things in my life um I will rewatch

452
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,679
Roseanne from time to time uhhuh because

453
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:16,720
it's uh a phenomenal sitcom like it's in

454
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,280
my mind it is the that's the top of the

455
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,840
of that particular Mountain so I like to

456
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,480
revisit that and then I have you know

457
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,520
comedy films I'm like okay those are the

458
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,080
ones that I aspired to um so this album

459
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,960
is is easy for me to revisit as a

460
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,679
comedian as a a standup because I don't

461
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,360
feel um the fear of of something rubbing

462
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,280
off the wrong the wrong way okay the way

463
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,960
I would if I was listening to a standup

464
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,480
album like uh you know Kyle Kain I think

465
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,120
is a fantastic stand-up comedian I'm

466
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,320
that's like the last big fan moment I

467
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,679
had before I was too far into comedy to

468
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,240
be like Oh I'm a

469
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:57,120
fan um as an audience member yeah um but

470
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,799
even now if I go back and listen to like

471
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
death of the party or something it's I

472
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,080
listening to it in a very different way

473
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,760
and kind of pushed back a littleit a

474
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,159
little bit just because I don't want

475
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,280
something to get into my mind and then

476
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm writing a joke that's too similar or

477
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,000
my voice starts to sound that way yeah

478
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,960
um so with this I can just I can just

479
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,240
wallow in it yeah no yeah and not worry

480
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,080
about that I I I have the the luxury of

481
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,720
not being a standup at least for that

482
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,039
that uh that part of it um but I I I I

483
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,720
completely get that do you think we this

484
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,240
is going to go off on a tangent a bit

485
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,880
but do you think that fear is unfounded

486
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,200
do you think it's just our own paranoia

487
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,000
cuz I have it with other things not

488
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,720
stand up particularly but do you think

489
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,919
it's do you think it actually would

490
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,919
affect you if if you if you dug

491
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,559
deeper um I

492
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,960
think I think in any creative form I

493
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,919
think you get nervous that you're just

494
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,520
going to I think it's a sense of being

495
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,840
found out yeah yep and feeling like a

496
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,000
fraud uh like if somebody looks too

497
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
closely it's like oh know you're going

498
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,400
to see my influences right right um

499
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,799
because there's a difference between

500
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,159
influence and and just outright oh

501
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,480
you're doing that person sure you know

502
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,760
um I think with standup it's a little

503
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,760
harder because like you can watch a

504
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,360
sketch and go I can feel their influence

505
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,960
here clearly whoever wrote this loves

506
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,400
you know XYZ whatever sketch troop or or

507
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,559
you know you can I mean you can look at

508
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,760
a sketch and go oh this person liked

509
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:33,200
this era of NL right um but it's not

510
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,559
coming through in a sense of oh that

511
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,440
person just sounds like that that writer

512
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,240
right um with standup because it's just

513
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,840
a singular thing it's just a voice and

514
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,600
and you're talking and you're you're

515
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,200
telling a joke there are rhythms and

516
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,880
cadences that can come I mean they can

517
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,240
just be ripped whole cloth from somebody

518
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,679
else and when a comedian is starting

519
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,400
it's like you can you can look at

520
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,320
somebody on stage and go oh okay here

521
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,520
are the two comedians they like the most

522
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,200
because they sound exactly like them

523
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,000
right yeah I mean and you you kind of

524
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,440
let it become your own um you have less

525
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,600
to mask you if it is just you and your

526
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,039
voice and a microphone yeah and it

527
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,520
worries me because I mean so many times

528
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,240
comedians will come up with a joke and

529
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,480
or a structured thing uh where there's

530
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,679
like a punch right here and then you'll

531
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,679
see uh you know an established National

532
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,039
comic like on television or in a special

533
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,039
or something like that and they they do

534
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,400
that same same exact thing and you go oh

535
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,440
and it's like you're mentally just

536
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,720
crossing it off the list all right don't

537
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,159
do that anymore um because comedy's a

538
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,279
finite thing and and the way you

539
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,159
structure a joke is just going to be

540
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,120
there's only so many ways you can do it

541
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,919
uh when you can't use editing or visuals

542
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,120
or anything else um so yeah I think

543
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,000
there is a a guarded sense there at the

544
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:56,679
same time I think as creatives we all

545
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,120
tend to get a little too worried about

546
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,480
that M and

547
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,120
uh you know I went through a phase as a

548
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,039
standup where I was like

549
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,480
I'm uh I'm throwing away so much

550
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,120
material because I'm afraid that even

551
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,480
the topic has been touched before right

552
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,559
right and it took me a a little while

553
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,640
for me to finally just just go I mean

554
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,919
everything's been talked about yeah

555
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,000
there isn't a single topic in the world

556
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,919
that hasn't been dealt with in standup

557
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,200
in some capacity sure so you know you

558
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,039
just have to make it your own you have

559
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,760
to talk about it from your perspective

560
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:34,240
and and not worry about that um but yeah

561
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
I think there is a little more safety

562
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,279
because I don't want I don't want my

563
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,799
inner monologue to start to carry the

564
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,600
rhythms that another comedian has I get

565
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:48,159
that I get that and that that does make

566
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,200
sense and luckily the bonus here with

567
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,640
with a Bruce McCulla I don't think

568
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,000
anybody ever could even try to mimic

569
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,440
what he does there's no I mean and I've

570
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,200
I've tried to do an impression of the

571
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,799
man it just doesn't you can't it's not

572
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,559
he is otherworldly in that way to the

573
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,559
point where yeah I feel like you can

574
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,400
absorb this I mean he's he's dealing

575
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,039
with again some classic themes like you

576
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,240
say no nothing hasn't been touched on

577
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,039
but he does it in these ways where you

578
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,760
have no you have zero idea what he's

579
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,960
actually talking about um right but

580
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,279
there's some beautiful thing uh I mean

581
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,600
your original question was uh you is

582
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,720
there a track that's like my favorite

583
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,000
track on the album I think it's uh when

584
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,120
you're fat I think it's the name

585
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,480
it um

586
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,200
because on its surface it could be seen

587
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,840
as a you know I think if I saw the the

588
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,360
track title on a lot of different

589
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,760
comedians albums my I my eyes would just

590
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,159
roll right in the back of my head yeah

591
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,919
um but it's this sad modlin song about

592
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,000
this poor woman who is

593
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:58,600
alone and and feeling very alone on her

594
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,600
birthday and just H everything's it's

595
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,559
just a sad depressing Moment In This

596
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:08,159
Woman's life and it is

597
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:11,520
so funny because it's it's it's it takes

598
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,480
away all you know um drama it's just a

599
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,720
person's life and there's a line in it

600
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,720
uh and I'm not going to do it justice I

601
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,880
can't remember it exactly but it's like

602
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,840
you you know your hand slips under the

603
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,679
cover she's laying in bed your hands

604
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,559
your hand slips under the covers and you

605
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,600
you know you climax and then you roll

606
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,840
over and think about your student

607
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,279
loans and I ruined the Cadence of it the

608
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,240
Rhythm everything but that moment I

609
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,520
remember even back in high school

610
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,120
hearing that and being like Oh my God

611
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,480
that's so normal you know it's so

612
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,000
overwhelmingly normal and then as I grew

613
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,840
up I went through college and I really

614
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,200
liked you know this the idea of this you

615
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,039
know hyp

616
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,240
specific uh normal reality being

617
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,880
completely absurd and now I think about

618
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,960
it as a 33 old with a kid and you know

619
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,799
crushing student loan debt I'm like oh

620
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:08,000
yeah I know you I I know you yeah yeah

621
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:11,360
so it's just a beautiful

622
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,399
moment uh yeah I think that's there's

623
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,600
there's so much of that in his in his

624
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,320
albums and Kids in the Hall and I think

625
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,880
anybody that is a fan of Kids in the

626
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,279
Hall can watch the show and a sketch

627
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,640
will pop up and you just kind of

628
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:29,520
inherently know who that's coming from

629
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,480
yeah that's true that is true it's

630
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,200
it's that that is the challenging thing

631
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,120
about his work and about their work

632
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,919
where you know there are a lot of comedi

633
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,360
I I

634
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,039
interview you know every few weeks I

635
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,039
interview somebody new and everybody's

636
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:43,960
got their own perspective most of them

637
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,080
are standups or at least actors but most

638
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,440
of them are stand-ups and you know you

639
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,840
will frequently get and I won't

640
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,080
necessarily try and I won't go out of my

641
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,399
way to disagree with it but there are

642
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,120
people who are of the opinion that well

643
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:57,880
whatever makes people laugh is that

644
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,480
that's comedy then that's that's all it

645
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:06,240
is but this is a thinker to the point of

646
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,360
frustration and and is it who would you

647
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,840
do you is this the kind of thing you

648
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,760
would recommend to just any comic or do

649
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,840
you have to feel it out and just say oh

650
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,840
this is your you know if they've never

651
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,760
heard of it oh this is your taste maybe

652
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,720
you'd like this like is this an album

653
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,799
that you've gone out of your way to

654
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,720
recommend to

655
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,720
people uh when I was younger I I would

656
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,679
you know scream it from the hilltops I I

657
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,960
would I would sing it is it sing it from

658
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,080
the hilltops and then shout it from the

659
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,279
rooftops it's broadcast it from the

660
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,760
Moonbase I would broadcast it from the

661
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,200
moon that thank you and we need to get

662
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,080
that movement happening um I would tell

663
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,399
everybody about it but it was in that

664
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,039
very uh College vein of just look what I

665
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,919
found yeah and and I'm aren't aren't I

666
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,159
the best for having found this before

667
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:57,000
you um but I think now I've gotten I

668
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,840
don't know if it's jaded or cynical of

669
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,679
me to think it I think no I think it's

670
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,840
just more understanding that comedy is

671
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,679
incredibly subjective and there are

672
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,600
whole worlds of Comedy that are for

673
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,519
different people and not at all for

674
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,679
others and I think I think this I think

675
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:18,320
shame based man is one of those secret

676
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,360
slided across the table kind of moments

677
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,519
where you go I think this might be for

678
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,720
you

679
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,519
right um I certainly wouldn't recommend

680
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,919
it to everybody sure have you connected

681
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,720
to other Comics over I mean have you

682
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,559
ever had a discussion about this with

683
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,039
with another standup or other comedians

684
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:39,320
of any stripe yes a couple um I think

685
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,840
it's a It's tricky because you tend to

686
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,880
meet uh it like if somebody's a big fan

687
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,120
of Bruce McCulla and shame based man

688
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,640
they are automatically a fan of Kids in

689
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,120
the Hall I think it's a thing I don't

690
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,840
think the ven diagram of somebody who is

691
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,279
a lover of Shame based man and not at

692
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,840
all a fan of Kids in the Hall May

693
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,840
there's one person and it might be

694
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,200
Bruce but I yeah so I've had the

695
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,919
conversation with people and I love you

696
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:17,360
know waxing philosophical about the

697
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:20,120
entire uh the entire UA right um but uh

698
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,720
like my one of my closest friends uh is

699
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,240
a huge huge Kids in the Hall fan a big

700
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,279
fan of Bruce and this album was actually

701
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,880
one of those things that we originally

702
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,760
connected on we were working at a movie

703
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,880
theater and um we were both

704
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,640
projectionists and and this is how we

705
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,480
came and found each other which sounds

706
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,519
like a perfect uh track that would be on

707
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,799
a Bruce album right these two

708
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,600
projectionists these lonely men in the

709
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,399
in the night finding each other in the

710
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,279
flickering Celluloid right like that's

711
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,440
just something that he would do and we

712
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:56,120
we just loved talking about it and and

713
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,240
you know quoting things back like people

714
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,440
like normal people do with the Simpsons

715
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,080
that's what we were doing with this and

716
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,159
um and uh and then there's an immediate

717
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,559
shame washing over me because we uh uh

718
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,640
so long story short I had the

719
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,640
opportunity to open for uh Kevin

720
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:20,000
McDonald um a couple years ago and I was

721
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,480
so excited and and very happy to do it

722
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,720
and we hit it off like immediately I

723
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,760
love Kevin Kevin's great and um we were

724
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,159
like best buds for the weekend it was

725
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,919
just it was wonderful and so the next

726
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,840
time um uh the the troop was getting

727
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,480
together to do a

728
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,600
tour Uh Kevin hooked me up with some

729
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,960
tickets and I was so excited and we went

730
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,799
and we watched the show and I had this

731
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,000
beautiful you know Middle School moment

732
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:49,919
in the in the crowd that and I could

733
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,440
watch the show and it was great they

734
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,360
were fantastic they were nothing was

735
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,960
lost it it was still just as sharp mhm

736
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,240
and um uh and there the bite was still

737
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,480
there like it it still hurt a little bit

738
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,200
which was great that's awesome and uh

739
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,440
and so afterwards uh we went backstage

740
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,799
and and I tried to compose myself and I

741
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,840
brought Tom My my friend Tom with me the

742
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:17,039
the projectionist and uh he was very

743
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,480
excited and he can be cool in a moment

744
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,600
and I a way I can't um because I'm too

745
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,639
in my own head sure and so we we met

746
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,919
everybody and everybody was fantastic

747
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:31,440
overwhelmingly normal and inviting and I

748
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,840
just kind of stood there uncomfortable

749
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,799
and all of these feelings of like I I

750
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,720
need to tell Bruce McCulla these things

751
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,880
uhhuh right but I don't want to be that

752
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,399
person sure especially around a guy who

753
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,919
is kind of just he he exudes a sense of

754
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,360
not wanting that right right and I made

755
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,519
it through most of the the time we were

756
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,159
all hanging out and right at the end I

757
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,039
just kind of let everything fall out my

758
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,159
mouth and I was just like I just think

759
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,399
you're great and you've been a bit of

760
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:03,600
inspiration for me and I have both of

761
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,799
your albums and you should really write

762
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,519
a book and I was just getting like

763
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,159
ushered out of the room by Tom I wasn't

764
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,440
getting kicked out but my friend Tom was

765
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,919
like pushing me out of the room like

766
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,000
just get out of here um and it it that

767
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,240
will eat away at me for the rest of my

768
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
life I don't know I feel like that's

769
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,559
that's the experience you're going to

770
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,159
get with Bruce Mulla I yeah is there

771
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,279
ever a moment where you can be like oh

772
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,760
yeah it was totally cool and he was no

773
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:34,960
he was super cash no that's and if you

774
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,440
if you want to go based off of the

775
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
character he portrays I was just

776
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,360
thinking about it he's like a more

777
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,600
slightly more approachable Andy calman

778
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,639
character uh and I never say calman I

779
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,440
don't know where that came from he is I

780
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:48,679
feel like he lives for the theater of

781
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,039
life to the extent that he's perfectly

782
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:51,760
happy knowing that other people are

783
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,440
awkward in his presence and that might

784
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,360
be in that way you made it perfect for

785
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,880
him so therefore you did have the

786
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,279
perfect Bruce McCall experience

787
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,639
yeah I think you're right I think you're

788
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:05,000
absolutely right because he does there's

789
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:08,039
a very short list of people that would

790
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,960
terrify me if I knew they were watching

791
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:13,639
my set right just like to the Bone like

792
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,120
oh I don't know if I could go out there

793
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:19,240
and the the list is like two people MH

794
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,200
and it's Bruce McCulla and the other one

795
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,200
is Stuart Lee but I mean that's that's a

796
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,000
whole different story but yeah um yeah

797
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,559
cuz there's a sense of even if you were

798
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,120
getting along with him and everything

799
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,880
was great and and you knew each other

800
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,039
fairly well at that point there I feel

801
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,679
like at any moment he could just turn

802
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,720
and it would it would all crumble in

803
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,519
front of you like you're both he strikes

804
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,440
me as the type that you're both laughing

805
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:46,440
at a thing that just happened and then

806
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,080
he just abruptly stops and goes now why

807
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,000
do you find that funny yeah that is that

808
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,480
is there needs to be a word for that I'm

809
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,080
sure the Germans do have one but that is

810
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,279
absolutely correct that is exactly you

811
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,440
get that from just his presence just

812
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,080
from just from looking at him and you

813
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,279
get that from if you look at a photo of

814
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,360
him from 1992 to a photo of him

815
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:08,040
yesterday there and I and I've heard him

816
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,320
interviewed he's a perfectly nice

817
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,760
congenial fellow however there is

818
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,000
something about him that scares you and

819
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,079
that's okay I mean I think that's kind

820
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,800
of cool but at the same time it's just

821
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,200
like why how did he accomplish that why

822
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,520
do I feel this way what does it say

823
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,919
about me uh but I completely relate to

824
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,119
it I I think you and I are both on the

825
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:29,760
same wavelength about we feel about him

826
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,000
the same way although you I mean you got

827
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,280
to me I don't I wouldn't have even

828
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,079
gotten those words out I don't know how

829
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,960
you manage that that's oh and please

830
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,599
please don't don't take that as me like

831
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,480
name dropping in anyway I'm sure he

832
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,119
would not remember a second of that

833
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,960
interaction but I will never be able to

834
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,960
forget it of course cuz it will always

835
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,560
be a regret like I should like I'm going

836
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,240
to replay that over and over like how

837
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,040
could I have been

838
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,679
cool how could I have done it and I

839
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,079
think that feeds into the grunge

840
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,200
mentality Bruce McCulla is this is going

841
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,040
to sound ridicul I think he is the KK

842
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,480
Cobain of sketch

843
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,200
comedy I'll take it I I think I I think

844
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,000
that's that's not imperfect that is that

845
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,520
that is a very uh that's really great I

846
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,920
guess we're just lucky that uh you know

847
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,720
uh we still got him you know I'll take

848
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,040
that um my God you know if if I ever get

849
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,480
him on the podcast I I won't necessarily

850
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,960
say who told me that unless you want me

851
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,400
to but I feel like I should be like

852
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,560
somebody once told me that they think

853
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,280
you're the H com and then I want to see

854
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,240
his reaction was he a big man in flannel

855
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,359
you know it was him it was him and this

856
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,000
feeds into my uh weird uh you know like

857
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:41,560
we were talking about at the beginning

858
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,119
um you know I didn't have a dad growing

859
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:49,640
up I have I understand and deal with the

860
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,079
fact that I have um daddy issues right

861
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,560
and they're going to come out in in this

862
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,680
sense of you know working with people I

863
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,720
admire sure um especially in comedy and

864
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,000
and and so all of that stuff is just

865
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,760
feeding into me with a guy like Bruce

866
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,400
McCulla where it's like oh you're

867
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,359
detached you're emotionally unavailable

868
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,520
and you hide your feelings like this is

869
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,400
a this is a perfect magnetic connection

870
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,599
where whatever isms he has perfectly

871
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,560
match like another Lego piece to these

872
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,920
isms and I'm like yeah you can go ahead

873
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:28,640
and absolutely emotionally wreck me go

874
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,640
ahead I will clean your car I I like

875
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,720
that in terms of uh what that probably

876
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,680
does to your your brain specifically

877
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,079
your brain in terms of its receptiveness

878
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,640
to different types of Comedy there are

879
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,560
people who I've had to force myself to

880
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,079
be interested in certain comedy uh I've

881
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,400
had to really push myself I I wonder if

882
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,880
it's the same for you is is there do you

883
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,240
find any kind of Comedy completely out

884
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,680
of reach for you or are you pretty open

885
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:57,000
to listening to new [ __ ] um I mean there

886
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,119
was a period of time uh like my my late

887
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,520
College days and my early standup days

888
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,280
kind of overlap a little bit and in that

889
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,960
time I was definitely in that that vein

890
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,240
of uh oh I've already figured out what's

891
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,920
good and what's bad yeah right and let

892
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,040
me tell you who's bad you know um I

893
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,839
think as I've gotten older and more

894
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,200
experienced in comedy I think is more

895
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:24,640
the the more important part of it um I

896
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,880
can appreciate the craft of just about

897
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,400
any standup or sketch or anything like

898
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,400
that I think when it drifts towards

899
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,200
more uh being more absent

900
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,359
of passion or or you know somebody

901
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,280
really loving what they're doing there

902
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,359
um I think it's easy to see that and

903
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,200
that's when I tend to go I I oh it's

904
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,400
homework you know there and there are

905
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,640
things that feel like homework um some

906
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,440
seasons of Saturday Night Live feel like

907
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,440
homework when I'm in it and I'm watching

908
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,240
and and my wife jokes about it and she's

909
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,440
like no I get why you have to watch it I

910
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,680
just really don't want to right now sure

911
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,560
yeah and uh but then there's moments

912
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,640
where it's magical and I'm happy and and

913
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,119
and I love that it's there but I like

914
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,160
that you attribute that idea of it

915
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,760
feeling like homework to being more of a

916
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,480
lack of passion than your uh

917
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,480
unwillingness to give something a shot

918
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,680
because it does seem like you're pretty

919
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,200
open-minded when it comes to this stuff

920
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,079
sure and and I mean on a good day that's

921
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,480
how I want to that's how I want to be at

922
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,079
least uh portrayed I I at least want my

923
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,119
external image to be that um I mean

924
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,119
inter there yeah if it's like if it's

925
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,400
super hacky kind of stuff I'm just like

926
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,839
I don't I have no interest into this

927
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,960
this is not for me yeah um but I think

928
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,280
that comes with just really believing

929
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,920
that there's comedy for everyone

930
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,000
everyone is going to have a certain type

931
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,160
of Comedy that's because everybody's

932
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,640
sense of humor is different sure and it

933
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,480
depends on how you're broken yeah it

934
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,000
absolutely you know what way are you

935
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,760
broken you'll probably laugh at

936
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,240
something in a different way it's

937
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,520
absolutely true um I and and I I really

938
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,240
want I I don't know enough about here's

939
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,200
the here's where I here's where I piss

940
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,560
off those annoying commenters and I say

941
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,800
oh I don't know such and such and then

942
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,520
they get angry uh but I really don't

943
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,480
know enough about his his backstory I

944
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,000
feel like I can infer a ton from his

945
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,920
material but I also feel like I can

946
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,480
maybe infer nothing from it because he

947
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,359
also could be playing the character of

948
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,040
this broken man you know it that's

949
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,319
that's what's so damn challenging about

950
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,720
it I'm sure he's dealt with some of this

951
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:25,920
stuff the addiction thing I know has

952
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,440
been he's talked about before I know

953
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,599
that there there is addiction in his

954
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,640
past in bits and pieces of that kind of

955
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,319
a broken childhood um but I don't know

956
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,800
the specifics I don't know if I want to

957
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:38,920
um but that's that's part of where the

958
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,160
challenge comes from yeah I think I'm

959
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,960
okay with not knowing his his past um I

960
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:49,880
think my my interest is definitely more

961
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,119
in how the troop works and and worked in

962
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,200
the past how they found each other I

963
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,040
know they've all talked about it you

964
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,000
know um over and over and over

965
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,400
especially especially

966
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,599
especially H oh

967
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,400
no you caught yourself I did it you

968
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:12,040
caught yourself I'll see myself C out

969
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:14,400
um but especially since uh the Advent of

970
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,520
of podcasting I think they've probably

971
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,520
had to talk about it so much sure uh

972
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,720
that they they really do need to just

973
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,040
make the book just write the Kids in the

974
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,079
Hall book and and get it done um because

975
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,200
I am fascinated with it I think because

976
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,599
they are so different and and you know

977
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,960
there's definitely been a lot of you

978
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,400
know infighting with them and but the

979
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,720
fact that they're still kind of a family

980
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,359
and come together that's interesting you

981
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,119
know how these very different voices

982
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:44,920
work together is is a fascinating thing

983
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,680
I think the individual

984
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,920
story um yeah not I'm not as interested

985
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,440
because I think that that part is more

986
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,280
personal than maybe I'd care to get with

987
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,640
them oh for sure yeah I mean you you

988
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,800
it's a thin line to watch but you're

989
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,480
absolutely right in terms of in terms of

990
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,960
just the fact that they stay together is

991
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,319
kind of shocking and like you say there

992
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:11,040
that if you can still uh put together

993
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:12,720
brilliantly biting satire that's just I

994
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,520
don't know I don't get that I don't get

995
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,880
how you do it I think that's great that

996
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,839
they still do it but uh that's but maybe

997
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,240
that's part of the because like you and

998
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:26,280
I are both are in sort of in that world

999
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,079
of comedy and maybe that's why we're

1000
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,440
we're uninterested

1001
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,680
or or less interested

1002
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,599
in you know the more like childhood kind

1003
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,400
of experience and growing up and and you

1004
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,680
know becoming fully fleshed human beings

1005
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,480
sure than we are in uh when things

1006
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:46,200
started to happen like any any of the

1007
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,880
SNL um Memoirs and things like that if

1008
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,640
someone could just just like rip the

1009
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,920
book in half yeah where it starts when

1010
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,760
they got a phone call from you know a

1011
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,680
casting agent or something like that

1012
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,599
that's where it gets interesting for me

1013
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,720
because that is such a

1014
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,400
machine that I want to know more about

1015
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,920
that it's like I don't need to know if

1016
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,520
you were molested you know I I

1017
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,200
appreciate it I understand but it's just

1018
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,290
so cliche

1019
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,119
uh that's awful I feel

1020
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:17,440
[Laughter]

1021
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,559
terrible oh my God yeah well you know

1022
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,640
I'm actually hoping no well now I'm just

1023
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,720
gonna I I don't want to I don't want to

1024
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,839
say that this is definitely going to

1025
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,000
happen but I might have a pretty good

1026
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:29,880
like SNL half of the SNL or Story coming

1027
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,160
up on the podcast in a few months is

1028
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,559
what is what I'm hoping so oh that's

1029
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,319
awesome yeah I fingers not as not you

1030
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,520
know it's not going to be Lauren

1031
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,880
Michaels or anything but my my my hopes

1032
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,680
are that we're going to have a at least

1033
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,040
half of the story um and I'll tell a

1034
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,880
little tell you a little bit about some

1035
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,520
of the stuff that we've already

1036
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,640
discussed when we stop recording because

1037
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,520
I can't again either way but yeah you're

1038
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,760
absolutely right that that that is one

1039
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,559
of those stories that hasn't been

1040
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,640
properly told it has been definitely

1041
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,960
told from certain perspectives but you

1042
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,520
don't

1043
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:05,480
picture and you know his written by

1044
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:07,240
winners ET ET Etc so um yeah I uh yeah

1045
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,119
I'm excited to do you should tell me any

1046
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,280
questions you've got regarding the

1047
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,240
history of SNL because you might

1048
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,400
actually have some more intelligent

1049
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,520
questions than I do I wouldn't doubt it

1050
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,000
um oh my gosh that's yeah now I don't

1051
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,280
have to do that right now do I yeah

1052
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,040
absolutely right now 100% okay so uh

1053
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,880
start with the the molesting question I

1054
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,040
think that start there and then just see

1055
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,599
where that goes just ask everybody that

1056
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,920
I regardless of who it is that comes on

1057
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,520
the show I just assume that that's

1058
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,200
happened um right just I think either

1059
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,839
that or start a new

1060
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,760
podcast and you have guests on and the

1061
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:45,599
all you do is ask one question right at

1062
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,280
the beginning MH uh have you been

1063
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,160
molested and what was that like and then

1064
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,800
just leave it I really didn't want to

1065
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,800
talk about this I'm so sorry I we're

1066
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,440
getting wildly off topic for my Moonbase

1067
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,760
discussion I know I where did where the

1068
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,440
hell did the Moonbase go I All I'm gonna

1069
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,240

1071
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,520
moon base it's just going to take The

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,640
Upfront cost uh sports teams are going

1073
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,240
to pay a

1074
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,440
mint if you think basketball is

1075
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:19,119
interesting

1076
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:24,119
now wait until they have less gravity

1077
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,119
and slam dunks become a three minute

1078
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,319
event you guys you guys got to get on

1079
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,559
top of this second this thing goes live

1080
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,559
you guys got to make sure you're giving

1081
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,119
what kind of uh so I'm assuming you got

1082
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,400
some like postcards and stuff people get

1083
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,359
for putting giving you money post oh

1084
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,599
yeah we have a whole tiered system on

1085
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:44,160
Kickstarter for gift packages um uh some

1086
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,640
of the solid stuff is in the middle

1087
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:51,480
brackets show

1088
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:54,800
$150,000 um you can actually name uh the

1089
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,400
the NBA team oh that's great um and it's

1090
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,079
it's fairly simple you get to you don't

1091
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,640
get to name it just whatever you want

1092
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:04,400
you have to pick from a list um it's all

1093
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,520
the existing NBA teams but instead of

1094
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,000
the um town or city in which they're

1095
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,400
based it's just

1096
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,359
Moon so it's like the moon hornets and

1097
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,040
the moon

1098
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:18,160
bulls and I like it because it just it

1099
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,440
turns them all into terrifying creatures

1100
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,440
it really does that's absolutely true

1101
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,400
yeah like Chicago Bulls oh yeah that's

1102
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,760
the NBA team uh Chicago or sorry Moon

1103
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,200
blls and you're like okay well we need

1104
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,760
to fix that

1105
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,119
problem much more for formidable at that

1106
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,040
point um yeah oh and to to get back to

1107
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,960
what you asked about like listening to

1108
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:43,160
Comedians and and being afraid of

1109
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,280
letting them creep into your voice I

1110
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:49,319
went on a nor McDonald YouTube binge

1111
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,800
last night and now I'm terrified that

1112
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,160
this is starting to creep into nor

1113
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,119
McDonald territory you should just

1114
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,359
embrace it my my buddy Allan on my other

1115
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,240
podcast was just doing nor McDonald on

1116
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,160
the show the other day like he was just

1117
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,640
doing an impression of him just he's

1118
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,640
like let's let's try this out for 5

1119
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,280
minutes and it was uh it was it was

1120
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,480
relaxing but I understand you you've got

1121
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,880
a rep to protect I get that oh what

1122
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,960
little rep I

1123
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,640
have okay

1124
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,119
so why listen to shame based man if you

1125
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,160
haven't heard it before if you are a fan

1126
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,000
of Kids in the Hall what's a good reason

1127
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,800
well then I mean if you're if you are a

1128
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,359
fan of Kids in the Hall you've kind of

1129
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,480
already answered that question right

1130
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,720
it's another thing that they did um

1131
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,160
because again keeping in that Grunge

1132
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,839
mentality uh it's like when that band

1133
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,359
was doing their thing and then they

1134
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,559
break off and then you're just left with

1135
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,640
Eddie veter you know and you're like oh

1136
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:44,680
man I I I wonder what the the old basist

1137
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,680
is doing you know nothing it's just

1138
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,520
Eddie that's your only choice um uh so I

1139
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,839
think people tend to seek out those

1140
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,920
things I've done it I'm guilty of it um

1141
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,280
I've I've think I've I think I have

1142
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,599
ingested every single media thing that

1143
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:06,440
exists that they've done uh as offshoot

1144
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:09,480
projects yeah um but for for Shan Bas

1145
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:13,559
man the the S the recommendation comes

1146
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,160
from I mean just how singularly Bruce

1147
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:19,720
Mulla it

1148
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:22,240
is and listening to Sham Bas man feels

1149
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,599
like you're getting a a

1150
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,040
concentrated like pitch meeting for uh

1151
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:31,160
an entire season of the show

1152
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:34,599
right like here are all of this is where

1153
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:37,280
his sense of humor lives and you get to

1154
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:39,400
experience that for a while and um and

1155
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,000
some of it is fantastic and other parts

1156
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,760
you're like I don't know if I'm maybe

1157
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,359
I'm not keeping up with this or maybe

1158
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,240
he's not telling me the in the best way

1159
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:52,440
but there is a miscommunication

1160
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,119
happening somewhere but that's a that's

1161
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,400
a beautiful part of it because then like

1162
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:00,079
a line will hit you I think his writing

1163
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,720
is phenomenal yeah his writing makes me

1164
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,000
want to chop off my

1165
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,000
hands and I don't know why I would do

1166
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,839
that I think you could chop one off and

1167
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,079
then you're just kind of stuck holding a

1168
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:11,880
like holding a Cleaver with the other

1169
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,800
one going I didn't think this

1170
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,760
through cuz how am I going to get this

1171
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,280
other one it's so true so but no yeah

1172
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,240
his writing is fantastic and I think

1173
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,440
having such a unique kind of Spoken Word

1174
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,880
album allows that to shine and don't

1175
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,040
listen to it expecting like a a

1176
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,079
beautiful voice to be singing right yeah

1177
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,000
I that was the other thing I forgot to

1178
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,000
bring up is that like that's not yeah

1179
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,880
that's absolutely not what you're

1180
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,400
getting but it's also at the same time

1181
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,599
very satisfying that that is the voice

1182
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,920
that's coming out because you that's

1183
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,079
that's the voice you hope Bruce would

1184
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:46,720
have I think um I it's like I'm I'm

1185
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,559
reminded of a a sketch that was on I I

1186
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,480
don't know if it was on the US uh airing

1187
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:55,000
but um I found it forever ago and it's

1188
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,200
it's just Bruce McCulla walking out onto

1189
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,799
the stage um uh you know in the Kids in

1190
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:05,119
the Hall uh studio and he turns on a

1191
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:09,000
boom box and it's just like a very

1192
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,480
simple like drum beat happening and he

1193
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,040
just starts slowly and very awkwardly

1194
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,000
dancing to it like with like a Todd the

1195
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:19,079
way a toddler would dance almost and

1196
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,960
then the beat would drop and he'll like

1197
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:23,160
freeze for a second and then it'll come

1198
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,400
back in and then there's just a close-up

1199
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,319
of his face the the the Beat Drops and

1200
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,839
he goes check it out and then it goes

1201
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:32,760
right back into it if like that's a

1202
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:36,440
that's a litmus test for somebody's

1203
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,680
sense of humor if you laugh at that

1204
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,720
that's the type of Comedy for you and if

1205
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:43,599
you and but I completely understand why

1206
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,319
meanwhile I'm laughing my ass off at it

1207
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,359
but I completely understand why somebody

1208
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:50,280
would go what is this and why why are

1209
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,160
people laughing right yeah

1210
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,000
100% that's that's that's a perfect uh

1211
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,839
condensing of of why to listen to this

1212
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,880
thing and why it's kind of beautiful um

1213
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:01,680

00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:26,240

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,359
of course we want but we're going to do

1249
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,760
screen of the movie on the Bas it's

1250
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:31,440
going to be a great thing oh well see

1251
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,520
that's that's even more exciting so guys

1252
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,720
this is going to be the first movie

1253
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,839
played on the moon that's I think it's

1254
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,680
going to be the second actually oh

1255
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,200
what's going to be the first one oh I

1256
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,079
think they already they've they've

1257
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,160
played a few movies I feel like they've

1258
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:43,680
done that haven't they have they tried

1259
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,119
to project a is this what you're telling

1260
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,160
me that they projected a movie onto the

1261
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,240
the moon I was I was going to I was

1262
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,000
going to yes and this to death I really

1263
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,040
was and then the the the very real

1264
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,760
question of have any movies been played

1265
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,640
on the moon now I need to know that I

1266
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,480
can't imagine they can get any light

1267
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,839
projecting device to successful I could

1268
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,760
be I I know [ __ ] about [ __ ] when it

1269
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,240
comes to space but that said if they

1270
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,720
haven't this is this is but what about

1271
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,680
the like just what about in the capsule

1272
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,200
oh I see what you're saying so so could

1273
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,839
they have possibly brought some sort of

1274
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,240
media watching device with them and did

1275
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,200
they in fact watch perhaps a feature or

1276
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,839
maybe even a short film did they did

1277
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:28,200
they riff a movie on the moon because

1278
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:30,240
that's uh boy oh boy boy yeah cuz I I

1279
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,520
feel like if it were today it it

1280
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,559
wouldn't it would be a non-starter that

1281
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,920
question it's like yeah iPad Mini you

1282
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,440
got it it's all set right right right uh

1283
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,440
but then I mean watching a movie on the

1284
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,119
moon that's that's a to-do it's

1285
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,960
absolutely true boy oh boy well guys

1286
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,640
they played golf it's true why not watch

1287
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,599
a

1288
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,319
movie and then the question is what

1289
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,480
movie should it be yeah I that's oh boy

1290
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:57,599
that's really oh boy I can't even I

1291
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,520
can't even improvise a really good joke

1292
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,799
about

1293
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,799
that why don't we say brain candy let's

1294
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,200
see oh [ __ ] I love that movie I know I

1295
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:05,920
know people sometimes don't like it I

1296
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,599
love it I really like that who doesn't

1297
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,799
like it I want their names don't like I

1298
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,200
I've heard that some of the kids in the

1299
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:12,799
hall themselves don't really oh they are

1300
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,680
unhappy but they made the whole movie

1301
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:17,000
when everything was breaking apart sure

1302
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,640
and wow this is this is the fear of

1303
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,119
being a Kids in the Hall fan as it

1304
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,559
