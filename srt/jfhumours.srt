00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,000
at a television it's all [ __ ]

27
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,159

to have a dream and a job it's fine you

32
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
know but the people will discourage you

33
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,680
from presenting yourself that way if

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,560
you're trying to make it in music or

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,240
comedy or something like that and uh

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,119
[ __ ] it [ __ ] the whole system uh it's

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,080
fine it's okay for you to get your

38
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,640
entertainment from people like me who's

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,040
like my mode of transportation is 2third

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,720
of a bicycle right

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,400
now because somebody stole one of the

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,360
wheels why that's so much more insulting

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,560
than stealing the whole

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,599
bicycle I have to [ __ ] wheelie

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,920
everywhere just to get to work so I can

46
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,280
do this I got arrested on that bicycle

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,440
which is a thing that can

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,000
happen I was on a bicycle uh I bought a

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,519
wheel for it don't worry I got a full

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,519
bicycle

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,959
going I'm riding it and uh and I I I

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,959
start to hear this cop honking like

53
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,080
quacking his car at me not full Sirens

54
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,720
because that would be like comedic level

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
Overkill

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,360
with a you know with a helicopter and

57
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,440
everything it would be awesome but uh

58
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,319
but he you know he didn't want to go

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,480
crazy with it so he's just like like

60
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,440
quacking his car at me and I didn't know

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,920
what to do I thought he wanted to go

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,840
around me so I turn around and he's

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,360
pointing like you I'm pointing at you

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm going to arrest I was like holy [ __ ]

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,440
I am getting arrested on a on a bicycle

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,440
you know so I stopped I got out of the

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,200
bicycle I put my hands on the

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,480
bicycle there's no cops episode that

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,879
prepares you for this situation

70
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,319
right so I was like what do I do and

71
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,239
this cop he pulled me over and he told

72
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,879
me hey you ran a red light you know

73
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,319
which I did I was going uphill it was

74
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,840
hot there's no around [ __ ] you you know

75
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,159
I ran a red light and uh and the only

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,680
reason he pulled me over was just cuz he

77
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,239
was just a cop you know just having a

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,439
day just oh all right that's just what

79
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,319
you do I guess if you're a cop so uh you

80
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,480
know so I didn't think it would be a big

81
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,840
deal he was going to let me go but then

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,560
he went into his car he did a bunch of

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,200
cop [ __ ] and he came back out and uh and

84
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,439
he told me hey I'm taking you to jail

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,680
because you have outstanding warrants

86
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,680
right you have old traffic tickets uh

87
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,079
speeding tickets expired tags stuff like

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,799
that right uh so I went [ __ ] and then he

89
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,640
took me to jail and

90
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,880
uh I

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,440
spent

92
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,600
probably too long in jail for this

93
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,440
specific

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,759
charge I might have called the cops

95
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,759
Serpico like a

96
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,560
bunch like a lot

97
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,720
I was in a bad mood you know I threw a

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,720
couple Jack Bowers in

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,080
there dude busted the crime of the

100
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,479
century right so uh so so I went to jail

101
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,800
jail is

102
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,080
horrible

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,560
horrible

104
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,080
horrible I had to watch King of Queens

105
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,080
for eight hours it

106
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,080
was unbearable

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,680
the episodes weren't sequential nothing

108
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,680
made

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,160
sense I'm in jail and uh this dude turns

110
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,800
to me and he says the the classic jail

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,840
line to me goes hey man what are you in

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,360
for right and I was in for riding a

113
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,360
bicycle

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,080
overzealously so I turned to him and I

115
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,080
said I raped a bunch of murderers

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
and then I murdered a bunch of

117
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,360
rapists and that's why I'm here right

118
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:49,520
now in Class C misdemeanor overnight

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
holding I started barking at him like

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,319
DMX get in his face you

121
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,440
know and uh and he laughed which was

122
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,639
what I was going for right it was good

123
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,000
cuz for some reason in my mind in jail

124
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,440
I'm thinking like uh oh there's only one

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,199
thing that I'm even slightly good at

126
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,560
I'll use that to survive I'll be the

127
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,479
funny guy right somehow you know they

128
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,599
won't that'll get me by I don't know

129
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,440
what I thought was going to happen like

130
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:14,680
some guy was going to pull a knife on me

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,720
and I was going to be like a priest and

132
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,560
nun and a rabbi walk into a

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,960
bar and

134
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:29,120
then somehow not die right uh luckily it

135
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,319
didn't come to that but uh but Jail jail

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,720
is is is horrible everyone knows that

137
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
the thing they don't tell you about jail

138
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,080
is that it is horrible and

139
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,639
simultaneously really boring and long

140
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,840
right so you don't want to talk to

141
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,039
anybody because you're surrounded by

142
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,039
people with very creatively placed

143
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,319
tattoos and uh just

144
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:53,960
dumb hair I don't know

145
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:56,080
just just people that suck you know uh

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,319
so you don't want to talk to anybody but

147
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,879
you have to entertain yourself you have

148
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,120
to keep yourself going so here's what

149
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,440
happens when you go to jail you look

150
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,599
around at the group of people that you

151
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,039
are chained to and uh naturally start

152
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,000
coming up with uh nicknames and wacky

153
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,240
backstories for all of them right so uh

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,080
so first there was a Lupe the plunger

155
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,199
Torres I don't know

156
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,759
why no one knows why lots of parentheses

157
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,440
middle names going on here you know uh

158
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,440
and there was old sleepy racist face oh

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
yeah

160
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,440
then there was a an old white man I

161
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,919
called hambone

162
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,479
Butterbean hamone was a farmer who got

163
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,960
into trouble with the law I don't know I

164
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:45,199
was just making [ __ ] up

165
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,919
right uh then you when this happens to

166
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,479
you you naturally assume the role of

167
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,479
Morgan Freeman the narrator of

168
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,680
jail so I'm looking around the room and

169
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm just narrating this whole experience

170
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,800
in my head I'm just like old old sleepy

171
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,400
racist

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,120
face he showed it like sticking that

173
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,000
needle into his face you I'm not good at

174
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,720
voices that's as close as going to

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,960
get I was in jail I had to make do with

176
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,199
a bad Morgan Freeman impression you

177
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,280
know so I'm going around the room and

178
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,039
I'm just looking at people and ham bone

179
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,120
man he bothered me cuz all right so we

180
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,000
went into this room eventually with a

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,800
toilet just in it all willy-nilly

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
there's just a toilet sitting in the

183
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,080
middle of this room it was not a bad

184
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,519
bathroom in life there are bathrooms and

185
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,519
there are rooms with toilets in them and

186
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,200
if you don't believe me go to jail

187
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,680
there's a room with a toilet in it

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,680
right it's

189
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,959
just it's just

190
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,000
there so they put us in this room and uh

191
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,120
and old old ham bone hammy hammy walks

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,040
up and he just whips his dick out and

193
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,200
starts pissing in this toilet right and

194
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,279
I'm like whoa like in my head I'm

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,720
thinking like hammy hammy no you're an

196
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,160
old white man you don't understand all

197
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,560
sorts of signals you're sending right

198
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,600
now you know but my brain and a much

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,399
more immature part of my mind I'm

200
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,079
thinking a old

201
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,240
hammy he shorted like whipping his dick

202
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:18,240
out cuz that's how you get through jail

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,399
right was in jail all night I had to

204
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,160
make do a lot of people when they go to

205
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,640
jail they uh they join gangs they take

206
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,720
up tattoo histry or however you say that

207
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:30,200
uh

208
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,200
me I went with the Performing Arts

209
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,800
like a person who should never be in

210
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,279
jail I walked around my cell I used the

211
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,519
ham sandwich as a microphone it was very

212
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,360
it was it was cool it was good and

213
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,600
that's how I wrote this bit

214
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,959
interestingly enough that's

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,190
a it's my kind of mind blowing right

216
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:55,480
it's like a snake eating its

217
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:55,480
[Laughter]

218
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,320
head its own head not its tail its head

219
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm going to leave that one in the CD I

220
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,640
think it's

221
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,040
good just analogies that don't make

222
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,120
sense that is pretty freaky though a

223
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,480
snake eating its own head try to imagine

224
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,839
it it's like an eer painting I don't

225
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,880
know so uh so anyway I got out of uh I

226
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,040
got out of jail 24 hours later I spent

227
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,680
24 hours in the can in the can what am I

228
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,680
talking like I'm hard

229
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,959
uh I just hung out in jail and I got out

230
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,680
of jail and the whole thing to be honest

231
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,680
with you it soured me on Jail

232
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,519
uh I don't recommend

233
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,000
it but I I was really I was really

234
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,480
disillusioned by the whole situation

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,040
because uh you know I mean just seemed

236
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,040
like kind of a kind of a misuse of the

237
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,920
justice system it was just kind of a

238
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,720
bummer I just ran a red light you know

239
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,560
it's not really a big deal there's

240
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,279
murderers walking free in this country

241
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,399
you know it's just sucks just sucks

242
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,720
right so uh so I wrote a letter to the

243
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,120
police officer that arrested me which I

244
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,120
will read for you right now here we

245
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,760
go dear officer

246
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,680
Vegas we accept the fact that we had to

247
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,680
sacrifice a whole Thursday in jail for

248
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,240
whatever it was we did

249
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,680
wrong what we did was wrong but we think

250
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,040
you're crazy to make us write an essay

251
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:44,120
telling you who we think we

252
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,560
are you see us as you want to see us in

253
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,720
the simplest of

254
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,200
terms the most convenient

255
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,000
definitions but what we found out is

256
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,440
that each one of us is a

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,440
brain and an

258
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,880
athlete and a Basket

259
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,839
Case a

260
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,000
princess and a

261
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,480
criminal does that answer your question

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,480
sincerely The Breakfast

263
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,999
[Applause]

Club thanks I mailed that [ __ ] to the

265
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,199
police

266
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,720
I'm got a rested

267
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,079
again oh man I work at a bar I have a

268
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,000
job we've discussed I have a job I have

269
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,120
a job I have tattoos right when you have

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,279
tattoos people always tell you hey you

271
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,120
shouldn't shouldn't get more tattoos

272
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,720
because how are you going to be able to

273
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,399
get a job right uh which is kind of a

274
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
[ __ ] circular argument because the

275
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,240
same people that say that to you are the

276
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,519
same people that won't hire you if you

277
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,720
have tattoos right so in a few decades

278
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,440
all those people are dead we can all

279
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,519
have tattoos everything's fine you know

280
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,760
but the the argument they always give

281
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,240
you is what I have a problem with they

282
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,560
always say hey aren't you going to

283
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,959
regret what you look like when you're

284
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,000
older and the thing is you are going to

285
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,199
regret what you look like when you're

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,920
older but it's not because of the

287
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:13,600
tattoos it's because you're [ __ ]

288
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,720
old that [ __ ] doesn't look good on

289
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,040
anybody right no amount of pork pie hats

290
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,519
and sweater vests can cover up the fact

291
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,959
that you look like a a tongue your balls

292
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560

293
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,839
frozen stop

and uh he met her like later on life and

312
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,639
they had this like really interesting

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,839
touching moment where they were like

314
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,720
looking at each other and he has like

315
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,800

prison camp tattoos right and they were

319
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,279
looking at each other and and she kind

320
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,160
of felt this connection like oh we have

321
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,240
the same thing and uh they were just

322
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,639
like sitting there and he was looking at

323
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,240

work touched up

327
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,399
right because looking good is important

328
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,399
how else are you going to get a

329
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,279
job I

330
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,759
uh all right let's go here I religion

331
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,839
never really stuck with me as a kid

332
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:04,600
never really got in my head and I think

333
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,000
the reason for that is that uh I was I'm

334
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,079
half Mexican I was raised by

335
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,720
old Catholic Mexican grandparent people

336
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,880
you know and uh and Catholicism is a

337
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,279
particularly sort of

338
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,199
graphic

339
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
weird just spin on that whole thing like

340
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:26,240
it's uh it's just a lot of weird imagery

341
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,440
and stuff um in particular there's one

342
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,519
character in Catholicism that they use

343
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,000
to sort of scare you uh just it's this

344
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,720
character that's like sort of this like

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,120
ominous

346
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:45,800
Supernatural monster named Jesus Christ

347
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,000
uh Jesus is the scariest character in

348
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,000
The Bible right Catholicism is all just

349
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,959
like these just weird like snuff

350
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,880
pictures of him just mid

351
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:00,680
murder just all over people's houses you

352
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,120
know multiple pictures of the same guy

353
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,360
being murdered it's it's

354
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,079
weird and he's like he's scary like they

355
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,639
try to kill him and he wouldn't die he

356
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,319
just keeps getting back up like Michael

358
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,560

448
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
reaction I don't know

449
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,799
why uh I'm drinking cuz I don't have any

450
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,400
reason not to it's great I have nothing

452
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,240
responsibilities I don't need kids

453
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,880
probably never going to have kids you

454
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,159
can just not have kids now like we

455
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,559
reached it socially it's

456
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,360
cool my biology is so mad at me right

457
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
cuz like that's your whole deal as a

458
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,159
being is to procreate and further your

459
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,280
biology but I figured out a loophole

460
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
where I'm just like I don't feel like

461
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,960
it I want to go to the movies

462
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,600
instead I don't [ __ ] care I don't

463
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,080
have kids that's too much responsibility

464
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,039
having a kid man I don't even take care

465
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,039
of my [ __ ] toes cuz they're so far

466
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,760
away like a child that's just

467
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,679
it's horrible it's too much I shouldn't

468
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,240
have kids here's here's a story about

469
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,200
why I shouldn't have kids right uh I was

470
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,720
in college and I was was dating this

471
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,640
girl she's drawing a picture of me right

472
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,320
we're hanging out she's drawing a

473
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,720
picture she goes hey man I don't know if

474
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,120
you know this but you have very WID set

475
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,080
eyes you have very exotic features right

476
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,200
and I was reading a textbook and the

477
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,159
textbook was telling me that WID set

478
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,760
eyes are often a byproduct of fetal

479
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
alcohol syndrome

480
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,630
[Laughter]

481
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,799
so here's why I shouldn't have kids

482
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,440
though cuz I turned to her and I said uh

483
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,159
hey you know be really funny is if I got

484
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,200
you drunk or I got you pregnant H

485
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,760
probably both uh and then you got drunk

486
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,440
a lot while you were pregnant and then

487
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,279
you gave birth to a child that we would

488
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,360
name shark face right

489
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:57,000
cuz eyes would be all over the side of

490
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,120
head able to see in both directions

491
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,279
that'd be hilarious but

492
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,159
not in the long term of that story right

493
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,640
you don't need a sharkface kid living on

494
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,000
your couch not going to Community

495
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,600
College playing Xbox and [ __ ] all day

496
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,840
smoking menthols for some reason I don't

497
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,840
know

498
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,039
why you know so I don't have

499
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,080
kids I don't have kids I have vices

500
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,039
which are like kids except I like them

501
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,440
uh uh I like them

502
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,080
uh they're fun and they're like kids you

503
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,320
have to keep feeding them and just

504
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,559
they're they're crazy I I there's a lot

505
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,480
of drugs I can't do anymore though

506
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,320
really mostly just drink these days I

507
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,679
used to there stuff I can't do anymore

508
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,200
right cocaine cocaine is the worst drug

509
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,440
because cocaine is the easiest row to

510
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,799
get caught doing because whenever you're

511
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,270
doing it you've got like three or four

512
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:55,000
forms of ID out in front of

513
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:57,279
[Laughter]

514
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,880
you so the cops kicking the door and

515
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,880
you're like that is Def Al

516
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,559
me have to play it cool you have to be

517
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
like ah it's cool I'm with you guys I'm

518
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,080
working undercover I'm dusting for

519
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
fingerprints

520
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,840
haaha I think there are some

521
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,360
fingerprints all over the inside of my

522
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,360
head and on my gums a little bit

523
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,919
too and if you laughed at that part of

524
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,799
the joke you and I are in a very sad

525
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,120
club together

526
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:36,360

527
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,000

528
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,000
join helps if you know

529
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,600
Spanish it's kind of a racist joke it's

530
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,600
okay I can make racist jokes like that

531
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,679
because I am half white and if you're

532
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,799
white you can just do whatever you want

533
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,799
right the way this country Works

534
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,799
apparently

535
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,559
uh I I'm half

536
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,080
Mexican and I uh I don't you know to

speak Spanish and I don't look a certain

538
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,320
way and sometimes people people give me

539
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:13,600
[ __ ] about it and they say Hey you know

540
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,000
why aren't you more Mexican it's just

541
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,320
cuz I'm just a person you just you're

542
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,679
free to just be whoever you want to be

543
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,159
you don't have to fit into like cultural

544
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,960
stereotypes and stuff you know and I

545
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,120
just grew up a certain way right so uh

546
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
so when people say that to me say Hey

547
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,600
Jake why don't why don't you act more

548
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,960
Mexican Jake Flores your last name is

549
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,279
Flores you're mexic your father's

550
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,120
Mexican didn't you learn anything from

551
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:37,360
your Mexican father I tell them uh I had

552
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,360
the ultimate Mexican father no

553
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,880
father it's not

554
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,760
true but it's

555
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,240
funny my parents are still married for

556
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,159
some reason I they didn't get the memo

557
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,480
that just love is dead and it's just

558
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,320
it's cute it's cute they think they

559
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,320
think they love each other it's awesome

560
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,559
acid's another one that's weird man I

561
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:08,440
was reading that acid is a acid was

562
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,520
concocted by the the CIA because they

563
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,480
were trying to come up with a truth

564
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,080
serum which is weird because they got it

565
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,000
almost right because acid will show you

566
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,960
the truth it's just the wrong kind of

567
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Truth like I just pictur them like

568
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,240
interrogating some guy just be like did

569
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,720
you do it did you kill her he's like uh

570
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,320
they're like tell us the truth and he's

571
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,320
like the truth is that we're all made of

572
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,320
stars

573
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,520
cuz that's what you see when you take

574
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:42,720
acid it's a great drug you know um let's

575
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,760

apartment um the great thing about

578
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,000
living in an efficiency apartment is

579
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,320
that the ceilings are so low you can't

learn important life lessons like

689
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,880
sometimes saying I love you is like

690
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,120
saying Candy Man or Bloody Mary or some

691
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,440

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,440
tries to murder you in a

693
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,919

695
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:12,159
I'm single uh single what's up I'm

696
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,320
single being single is great being

697
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,799
single is uh it's great because you can

698
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,360
do whatever the [ __ ] you want single got

699
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:22,799
no kids I can do whatever I want all the

700
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:25,519
time uh you know it's it's the best uh

701
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,679
being single is a constant party that is

702
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,760
punctuated every once in a while by just

703
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,880
very very brief moments of just bone

704
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,880
chilling existential

705
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,639
loneliness but then it goes back to

706
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,639
being fun and it's fun 90% of the time

707
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:42,120
so you keep doing it cuz there's no

708
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,480
consequences so being single is just

709
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,240
like it's a it's just all partying and

710
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,240
drinking and whatever and then every

711
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,799
once in a while you're just in your

712
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,840
apartment and you're just peeling a

713
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,919
potato for one and you're just like [ __ ]

714
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,200
I'm going to die alone die alone and be

715
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,519
eaten by

716
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,919
cats reanimated as some sort of lonely

717
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,760
superhero I don't know what the [ __ ] is

718
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,440
going to happen I'm going to die and go

719
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,639
to hell I'm afraid I'm I'm afraid I'm

720
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,039
going to die and go to hell I'm afraid

721
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:13,279
of Hell which is weird because I don't

722
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:14,840
believe in hell but I also didn't

723
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,159
believe that bed bugs could survive on

724
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,159
seamen so what do I really

725
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,200
know about

726
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:29,159
life anything I'm open to new

727
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
explanations for the universe you know

728
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,880
I don't

729
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,399
know this guy tried to read my palm a

730
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,880
while back uh you know palmistry you

731
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,840
know you look at someone's hand and then

732
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,960
try to read their future uh if you want

733
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,960
to read someone's future don't look at

734
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,960
their hand look at their

735
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,360
teeth I was on the bus the other day I

736
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,559
looked at this dude I was like you're

737
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,559
going to die yesterday what the

738
00:32:52,919 --> 00:33:01,799
[ __ ] happen to your mouth

739
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:04,039
[Laughter]

740
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:07,480
this is a weird one I

741
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,200
uh I don't know I brain plays tricks on

742
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,480
me sometimes I was hanging out at the

743
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,320
bus stop recently it's going in between

744
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,480
towns and uh I was looking at this puppy

745
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,880
this like person was walking this like

746
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,600
cute puppy or whatever and I uh I caught

747
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,960
my brain playing a really weird trick on

748
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,120
me it was like taking a mental image of

749
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,000
this puppy like to I guess think about

750
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,639
later to

751
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,120
better you know like life is that

752
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:36,039
depressing and everything's a nightmare

753
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,720
I guess and uh and I realized that's the

754
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:40,559
same mechanism you use for the spank

755
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,880
bank which uh if you don't know what

756
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,519
that is it's like a some people walk

757
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,639
around and then like take mental

758
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,039
snapshots of women basically and go home

759
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,559
and jerk off about it I'm not saying

760
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,080
it's a thing that I do I'm just saying

761
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,919
that it's a thing that people do that I

762
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,600
do a lot

763
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,399
and I'm spank banking this puppy and I'm

764
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,080
like Jesus Christ is that my life has

765
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,080
come to is that how bad it is you

766
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,760
know cuz I mean sometimes you're just

767
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,560
like in a bus and you're just watching

768
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,560
States pass by and you're just it sucks

769
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,119
you're just just zoning out and people

770
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,159
are just everyone on the bus is just

771
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,399
thinking like I wonder what time we're

772
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,760
going to get back to Texas and you're

773
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,359
just thinking like I wonder what happens

774
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,560
to your Spotify account when you kill

775
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,040
yourself and

776
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,520
then this puppy right comes back into

777
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,359
your brain so I realize that's what that

778
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,520
is that's what like a that's what that's

779
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:28,760

I don't know how that that thought's

790
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,280
supposed to end

791
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,320
really I was in a bar a while back and

792
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,839
there's this guy a lot a lot of people

793
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,800
that hang out out in uh the punk rock

794
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,240
sort of scene have this tattoo or this

795
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,680
back patch the anti- swastica it's a

796
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,079
it's a dead Kennedy's thing it's a

797
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,800
swastika with a circle and a slash

798
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,800
through it like Ghostbusters or

799
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,480
whatever it's it's like a really bold

800
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,760
statement it's like oh I am against

801
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,079
Nazis all

802
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,320
right everybody's against Nazis it's a

803
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,920
default

804
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,720
position generally we all saw Indiana

805
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,119
Jones nobody really cares

806
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
that you're taking a stand to be against

807
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,560
Nazis like what do you feel like you

808
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,040
feel like you're going to go into a bar

809
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,680
and uh and and there's going to be a

810
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,240
couple of Nazis in the corner drinking a

811
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,320
manny shevitz to be ironic CU it's 2013

812
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,599
you know and they're going to be like oh

813
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,599
we can't to go anywhere I don't

814
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,960
know it's [ __ ]

815
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,760
happen but that's how people think

816
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,960
because we live in the city you know

817
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,760
uh so a lot of of weird social politics

818
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,920
going on in in this city because this is

819
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,920
a specific type of city right Austin is

820
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,160
a type of city it's a Brooklyn it's a

821
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,520
Portland it's like one of those [ __ ]

822
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,720
places like there's a thing here called

823
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,359
the uh called ham the Health Alliance

824
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,560
for Austin musicians right which is cool

825
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,920
I'm kind of for it uh except that it's

826
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,119
kind of exclusive right there's no

827
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,240
Health Alliance for Austin comedians it

828
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,000
would be cool if there was because it

829
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,000
would be called a hack and

830
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,480
[Laughter]

831
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,480
and that's fun right it's fun for

832
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,119
everyone

833
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,440
it's it's a good

834
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,720
joke but it bothers me because you know

835
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,040
it's it's kind of like there's different

836
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,960
types of cities right and this is kind

837
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,640
of a snobby city that is to say like uh

838
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,160
hey we're you know this town we would

839
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,839
like to just give free health insurance

840
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,079
to just the coolest of the poor people

841
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,079
right

842
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,160
just what about regular poor people like

843
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,280
if you're just some hobo dying in a

844
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,760
gutter somewhere of some hobo disease

845
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,599
like soup pants or beard mice or

846
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:08,280
Restless entire body syndrome

847
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,280
or or just a gypsy curse you

848
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,359
know so I'm pretty sure homeless people

849
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,000
get cursed by gypsies a lot for some

850
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,359
reason I've seen enough movies you know

851
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,200
if you're that person then no one gives

852
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,960
a [ __ ] about you grab a kear and start

853
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,040
strumming because no one

854
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,319
cares unless you're in like a cool Billy

855
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,680
Joel cover band or something unless it's

856
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:30,520
a big [ __ ] joke you know um it's

857
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,440
interesting though there's there's

858
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,920
there's different types of cities you

859
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,839
know and I like living here because this

860
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,200
is a certain type of city but when you

861
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,920
travel around you notice different

862
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,280
things you know I was in San Antonio a

863
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,280
while back which is the other kind of

864
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,760
place right San Antonio is a city the

865
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,119
main attraction there is just a mall

866
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,720
basically um you know it's it's just

867
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,599
there there's a mall and then there's

868
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,960
like a Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum

869
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,720
and then there's just reasons to start

870
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,280
drinking that's all exists

871
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,319
in this place and I don't like it you

872
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,359
know I don't want to live there I want

873
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:06,200
to live here in a place where we can uh

874
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:08,240
you know elect a lizard mayor or

875
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,880
something and I

876
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,680
just but I get this weird feeling inside

877
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,119
of me when I go there because I was born

878
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,800
in San antoniio when you're born

879
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,240
somewhere you have this strange Cosmic

880
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,119
connection to it so when you're walking

881
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,200
around like I don't like this place but

882
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,160
there is this weird Spirit thing inside

883
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,200
of me that's like yeah like maybe it

884
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,119
would be kind of actually nice to stay

885
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,800
here and just sit on a bar stool karaoke

886
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,800
bar and do jello shots until I'm just

887
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,560
[ __ ] dead it's like that feeling you

888
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,960
get like how you start to get warm right

889
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,960
before you freeze to death you

890
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,000
know so this inner battle when I go to

891
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,520
San Antonio where it's just like San

892
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,560
Antonio's like Darth Vader it's like

893
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,640
Jake I'm your hometown and I'm like no

894
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,160
it's not

895
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,040
true cuts my arm off with a neon taco or

896
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,040
a Spurs sign or

897
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,240
something the next movie isn't as good

898
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,240
but living in that

899
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,800
City living in San Antonio is like

900
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,270
acting out Texas history in Reverse it's

901
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,839
a heroic struggle to get away from the

902
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:18,520
[Laughter]

903
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:20,040
Alamo just as far as possible you know

904
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,839
uh so I so I you know I don't live there

905
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,520
anymore I live here which is cool I like

906
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,000
I like the city but it's one of those

907
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,960
Portland Brooklyn kind of places where

908
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,440
there's just no [ __ ] rules it's

909
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,880
killing me it's killing me to live here

910
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,680
uh it's it's too much fun

911
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,839
there's f f first first off about the

912
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,079
city there's no repercussions for like

913
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,119
just how you dress or care of

914
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,640
yourself I don't like to throw the word

915
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,400
hipster around I think it's the worst

916
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,839
word of this generation it's just

917
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
meaningless and usually when you call

918
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:52,079
somebody a hipster you're guess what

919
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,440
you're a [ __ ] hipster right but uh

920
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,359
but it is kind of funny like it is kind

921
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,800
of funny that there are people walking

922
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,520
around in this city that just look like

923
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,880
Wizards that are trying to blend into

924
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,760
muggle Society you

925
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,640
know like they just don't know how

926
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,119
clothes work they're just full marching

927
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,720
band suit and ski boots or whatever and

928
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:14,079
still gets laid all the time it

929
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,079
shouldn't

930
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,920
happen it's not okay you know but uh but

931
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,960
you know but but whatever gives a [ __ ]

932
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,200
you know uh but the other problem this

933
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,920
town the main thing is it is is just

934
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,040
it's it's just okay to drink way too

935
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,640
much here like it's not frowned upon at

936
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,440
all it's just

937
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,839
uh you're not supposed to be able to

938
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,240
just have six beers with dinner or

939
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,359
whatever but we all agree on

940
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,040
it if you leave this town guess what

941
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:50,240
you're a disgusting alcoholic you don't

942
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,240
know

943
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,800
it you don't know it yet but you are you

944
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,680
know this isn't even this isn't even a

945
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,680
comedy show this I'm not recording album

946
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,680
here this is a reverse

947
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,200
intervention gathered you all here to

948
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,200
talk about our Collective

949
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,920
problem it's [ __ ] City Austin should

950
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,920
be spelled with two A's you

951
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,480
understand so those are the two things

952
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,880
that make you an austinite right being

953
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,839
uh being a just a disgusting drunk and

954
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,359
also being kind of a hipster snob about

955
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:29,599
it right I feel like the epitome of

956
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,560
being an austinite would be if you were

957
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,560
to breathe a bored sigh into a

958
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,560
breathalyzer

959
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,680
right like you get pulled over by the

960
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,440
cops and the cops are like uh you know

961
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,440
blow into this and you're just

962
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,079
like for real

963
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:00,839
[Applause]

964
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,920
cops like you blew a 1.5 blood alcohol L

965
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,880
right you're like 1.5 I remember back

966
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,210
when it was

967
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,000
1.3 back when it was

968
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,800

around while back and uh I was thinking

about there's this uh old performance

974
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,640
artist actor guy named Spalding Gray you

00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,240
never heard spelling gray he was like

976
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,200
this dude uh he lived in Brooklyn for a

977
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,839
while he was in some movies he would do

978
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,200
this [ __ ] where he would get up in in

979
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:39,240
bars and stuff in theaters and like you

980
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,359

981
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,800
interesting personal [ __ ] from this

982
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,000
journal and like uh you know was like it

983
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,200
was very fascinating and funny it was

984
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,200
like this but funny and [ __ ] and like

985
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,920
cool uh he probably didn't work at a bar

986
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,480
you know like it was it was interesting

987
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,040
and uh and he he jumped off the Brooklyn

988
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,119
Bridge or something like killed himself

989
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,880
like this really famous interesting

990
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,400
archetypal suicide like oh he's this

crazy genius or whatever right I was

992
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,880
thinking about that and I was having

993
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,680
kind of a weird day and I was walking

994
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,920
around uh downtown over that that bridge

995
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,359
that goes over the lake in the middle of

996
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,000
town and I looked over it and I uh I

997
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:19,319
realized that if you try to uh Spalding

998
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,160
Gray yourself off of the bridge downtown

999
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:24,020
you won't die you'll just end up in an

1000
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:30,620
inner tube with a beer in your hand

1001
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,620
[Laughter]

1002
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,880
is this [ __ ] City won't let you stop

1003
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,880
partying not even to

1004
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:46,280
die it's

1005
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,240
great it's a great way to live

1006
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,599
man I was in New York there's a

1007
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,559
stereotype about people from New York

1008
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,440
it's that they're uh they're like rude

1009
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,160
you

1010
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,960
know good there's one here right now

1011
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:06,680
yeah yelling [ __ ] out

1012
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,680
uh maybe the joke's over I don't know

1013
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,720
uh no I'm just messing with you New York

1014
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,280

you know and uh I didn't know this but

1016
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,599
there's a guy who operates the subway

1017
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,520
car like he's he drives it I thought

1018
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,599

out of the side of the train and uh and

whatever and he kept doing it and uh

1054
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:52,880
then he told me this really sad story

1055
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,359
about being in the Vietnam War right he

1056
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,559
was like a like a veteran and uh I felt

1057
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:00,880
really bad for him cuz he just sort of

1058
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,440
been [ __ ] over by the whole system he

1059
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,920
has no family anymore he lives in the

1060
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,119
streets right and uh when I uh when I

1061
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,200
got up to leave he said something very

1062
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,720
sad to me he said hey hey man can I have

1063
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:16,640
a hug and I was like ah like sure you

1064
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,119
know uh so I wrapped his arms around me

1065
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,079
and I wrapped my arms around him and

1066
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,520
that's when I felt his boner digging

1067
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,520
into my

1068
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,359
leg had a boner right so this this

1069
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,040
really weird moment where I was like

1070
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:37,160
[ __ ] like what do I do you know like

1071
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,160
because the man had nothing left right

1072
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,240
he' been screwed over by his just whole

1073
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,200
experience in Life or whatever so uh so

1074
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,240
what I did was I just let him [ __ ] go

1075
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,400
for it right uh

1076
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,800
because life has [ __ ] you over that

1077
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,400
hard I say [ __ ] go for it right uh

1078
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,559
there's not really a point to this story

1079
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,839
uh basically all I'm trying to say is

1080
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:58,839
support the troops

1081
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,000
in whatever weird way you

1082
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,520
can I voted I voted for Obama the one

1083
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,480
time I don't really give a [ __ ] about

1084
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,880
politics like we're all screwed you know

1085
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,440
but I voted for him the one time because

1086
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,640
I believed that every person should have

1087
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,040
access to uh health insurance and uh

1088
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,160
then I started doing comedy I traveled

1089
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,079
around and I

1090
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,640
met everyone and now I believe that

1091
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,440
nobody should have health insurance

1092
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,720
right just [ __ ] the whole system just

1093
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,119
[ __ ] them all uh but I did vote I voted

1094
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,440

1095
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,119
Mexican-American Food Mart um in my

1096
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,520

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,440
a place where you can buy bananas and

1099
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,440

live in Texas nothing happened you know

1103
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,359
I don't really have a lot of faith in

1104
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,599
the whole democratic system anymore

1105
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:13,720
because it's it's so obviously just not

1106
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:16,079
really functioning uh there will never

1107
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,400
be an another ugly president I think

1108
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,920
that's a thing like it'll just never

1109
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,640
happen last one was like Taft and then

1110
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,280
after that they're out Ralph nater had a

1111
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,359
lot of great ideas right Ralph nater

1112
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,800

1113
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,800

00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,240

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,359
bar a while back a lot of these stories

1161
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,000
start like that and uh was at a bar and

1162
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:45,240
I went to uh went to take a piss in the

1163
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,200
urinal and uh in the urinal and somebody

1164
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,079
had written some graffiti like above the

1165
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,160
urinal it said uh it said Love is Real

1166
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,880
which is like whoa like really lofty

1167
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:58,000
graffiti you know I was like oh a poet

1168
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,040
took a piss here that's

1169
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,799
weird but it was interesting it's kind

1170
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,200
of an interesting social statement you

1171
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:06,319
know to bring up because it was like

1172
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,359
well it's interesting concept it's 2013

1173
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:11,599
you know is love a real thing is it uh

1174
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:13,400
you know like this real concept from

1175
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,359
philosophy or is it you know maybe like

1176
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,920
a sort of a like perpetuated uh concept

1177
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:21,000
that came around around the Advent of

1178
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,559
Agriculture that was constructed by the

1179
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,599
church and state to keep families

1180
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,000
together otherwise society would crumble

1181
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,799
and people would go crazy and no one

1182
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,760
would pay money to the the hierarchy or

1183
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:30,160
whatever or maybe it's just this thing

1184
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,880
it's sort of being perpetuated by the

1185
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,640
Disney Corporation to put dollars in

1186
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,359
hands sort of thing and I started you

1187
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,599
know maybe it's the real thing I maybe

1188
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,920
sometimes life actually works out like

1189
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,280
that and I was thinking about all this

1190
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,200
and I realized I was thinking this with

1191
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:47,240
my dick in my hand right it's just going

1192
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,240
all College on this urinal just like oh

1193
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,559
interesting so I

1194
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:55,599
finished I left I thought about it for a

1195
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:57,200
while and it really stuck in my head I

1196
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,119
thought about it

1197
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:03,160
I think love love is like HIV it was

1198
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,160
real in the

1199
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:11,480
80s mostly dead now we mostly killed

1200
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,680
it we killed it with drugs and

1201
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,920
everything's fine we're better off

1202
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,680
without it uh it was real back then when

1203
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,200
all the cool music was made and uh were

1204
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,760
past it you

1205
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:26,799

1206
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,599
this I was laying on the floor floor of

1207
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:30,960
my apartment and I was staring at my

1208
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,319
ceiling I was having a weird day and I

1209
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,720

1214
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,720
my ceiling was yelling back at me

1215
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,280
because uh I was on mushrooms and

1216
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,359

1217
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,040

back to that bar uh went to the same

1226
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,760
urinal and someone had added the word

1227
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,680
gay onto that sentence right now if they

1228
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,559
had put the word gay at the beginning it

1229
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,720
would have said gay love is real right

1230
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,839
it would have been an interesting

1231
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,559
subversive social statement it's 2013

1232
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,640

American History X was a sad

00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,200
used like them a lot more Weir thing

1279
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,119
about horror movies is that uh

1280
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,359
eventually like you they stop scaring

1281
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,000
you like remember when you were a kid

1282
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:18,119
and scary movies were actually freaky

1283
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,280
they got in your head or whatever you

1284
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,480
know the older you get they don't scare

1285
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,520
you they just they just uh I don't know

1286
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,480
they're just kind of weird and like

1287
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,039
you're just numb I've seen everything on

1288
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,079

don't doesn't freak me out I don't care

1293
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,160
you know yeah and I think I figured out

1294
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,039
why that is it's because when you get

1295
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,760
older like you still have fears but all

1296
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,440
your fears evolved into all these weird

1297
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,200
abstract Concepts that wouldn't make a

1298
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,039
good movie you know like you would ever

1299
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,799
watch a movie where the ghost doesn't

1300
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:56,400
you know haunt you it just just calls

1301
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:56,400
you about student loan debt and [ __ ]

1302
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:05,440
just just

1303
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:07,520
boo you got a liberal arts degree now

1304
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,359

1305
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,000
[ __ ] scary [ __ ] that's what keeps me

1306
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,000
up every

1307
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,920
night that's what happened in my

1308
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:23,520
life dropped out of

1309
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,359
college I think that's why I don't

1310
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,880
really give a [ __ ] about uh college

1311
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,160
football like sport like that no cuz

1312
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,480
there's a team for every college and

1313
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,119
there's a college for every town but

1314
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,400
there's no team that represents people

1315
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:36,799
like me like if there was a team of

1316
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,559
people that like played football that

1317
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,280
didn't go to college or dropped out of

1318
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,640
college and they got to play against the

1319
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,319
college that'd be [ __ ] cool right

1320
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,680

police the the social

1333
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,640
institution not the

1334
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,880
band but [ __ ] them

1335
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:29,079
too [ __ ] the police

1336
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,319
[ __ ] sting Dune was a weird movie [ __ ]

1337
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:33,599
him

1338
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:35,720
I I was walking around a couple years

1339
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,680
ago right I with my buddy Joe stats it's

1340
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,319
comic walking around we got we got

1341
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,000
jumped by a bunch of people downtown

1342
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:45,760
just for like no reason you know we just

1343
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,319
got attacked and uh and and we we called

1344
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,559
the cops like we got attacked and we

1345
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:51,720
didn't get like robbed and it wasn't

1346
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,760
like a racially motivated thing it was

1347
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,680
very bizarre uh just [ __ ] beat us up

1348
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,119
and then left and we don't know what to

1349
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,520
do you know so we called the police to

1350
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:03,880
try to try to get like his face fixed

1351
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,079
and stuff and uh and they never showed

1352
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,240
up right it was really disheartening it

1353
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,200
kind of sucked because the thing about

1354
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,960
cops is that when whenever you need a

1355
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,079
police officer they're never around

1356
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,000
right those few times in your life but

1357
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:16,559
if you're peacefully protesting or if

1358
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,079
you have weed in your pocket you're just

1359
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,799
hanging out [ __ ] cops are everywhere

1360
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,280
they show up they kill

1361
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:25,160
everybody they bring the at at Walkers

1362
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,359
and death stars and [ __ ] and they

1363
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,720
[ __ ] kill people right so uh you know

1364
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:31,920
so bum me out and I was thinking about

1365
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,920
it and I figured something out right if

1366
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,400
you uh if you're walking around tonight

1367
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,280
and God forbid anything happens to you

1368
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:41,039
if you get attacked or uh you know

1369
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,160
mugged or whatever uh here's what you do

1370
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,880
you get on a bicycle and you ride it

1371
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,880
through a red

1372
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,960
light the cops will show up and murder

1373
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,880
