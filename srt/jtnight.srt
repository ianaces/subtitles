True Blood

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,000
happened I said you know that's not a

37
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,799
[ __ ] documentary right like what the

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,040
[ __ ] is what is happening here and I had

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,520
never been confronted with a real fake

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,680
vampire before because she had those

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,799
like I work at Hot Topic Fang things

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,560
that you insert to find whatever you own

43
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,320
the night I don't know how that works

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,799
out and so I didn't know what to do to

45
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,720
thwart the she vampirus so I just

46
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,159
reached to my back pocket and pulled out

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,000
a greeting card that says daddy loves

48
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,119
his little girl very very much and she

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,240
went and ran to an 80s night across town

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,240
as half that story is true

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,560
uh I do like True Blood though who likes

52
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,960
that stupid sexy show does anyone else

53
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,320
like that stupid don't shake your head

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,000
that's [ __ ] you know well you don't

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,159
like boobs and vampires those are two

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,079
that those are the chocolate and peanut

57
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,880
butter of [ __ ] cool

58
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,759
things it's a dumb show it's a guilty

59
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,800
pleasure but I have Netflix insomnia and

60
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,440
access to

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,920
marijuana so I binge watched the first

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,599
season of of True Blood and the problem

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,000
is I'm also very practical so I watch

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,440
the entire season in a day smoke my face

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,080
off and then it's 2: in the morning on a

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,239
Sunday and I'm looking at the ceiling

67
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,560
trying to apply science to True Blood

68
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm like all right let's see let's see

69
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,480
all right so when the vampires in True

70
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,080
Blood when they get emotional and they

71
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,120
cry they cry like tears of blood right

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,239
it's like bloody tears going down their

73
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,640
face so by that logic whenever Bill

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,680
bangs

75
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,000
suie vampires just jizz blood all the

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,680
time right there's just like a 24-hour

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,560
gu show happening on the set of True

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,280
Blood at all times and does that mean by

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
like by that extension is giving a girl

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,000
a facial called giving her a carry he's

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,799
like oh oh oh they're all going to laugh

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,799

83
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:11,720

84
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,799

85
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,519

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,360
