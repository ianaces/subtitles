00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,240
I mean I don't know why I'm even so

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,240
[ __ ] wrapped up in this idea of of an

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,080
afterlife I think part of it to do that

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,199
I'm getting older my family's getting

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,000
older and they're starting to get uh

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,480
health issues I mean the last time I was

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,920
here I'm a European tour I received one

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880
of those circular emails from my mom you

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,559
know the kind that includes every member

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,040
of your family you know and that happens

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,079
is either going to be good news or

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,399
horrible and it definitely was the

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,280
latter long story short family member of

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,480
mine going in for emergency surgery 5050

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,360
whether or not they're going to make it

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
email me the next day and tell me how

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,079
when of good news is ladies and

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,520
gentlemen she made it she's going to be

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,520
with us for years and years to come but

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
I got a little

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,439
emotional and I hit

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,439
reply

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:10,439
all and I sent this message to every

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,360
member of my family I said look I know

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,000
since my divorce I've been a bit weird

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,920
there's reasons for that but I'm coming

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,320
out to Canada and I'm going to be around

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,479

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,520
P.S I love you guys and I'm 40 years old

31
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,159
and I don't give a [ __ ] who knows I love

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,880
my family I don't think that's unmanly

33
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,479
or a feminine if you H some in your

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,159
family you feel that way but

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,720
you tell them you tell them and you tell

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,000
them tonight because you may never get

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,920
another chance but if you do

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,399
it with an email take my advice and

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,119
proofread your [ __ ]

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,920
email before you send it cuz sometimes

41
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,520
it's not about the words you do say it's

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,840
about the words you leave out cuz maybe

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,159
you're a little hung over in a different

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,159
time

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,840
