1
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:20,485
(laughter) Limo's here. You

2
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:21,485
Ready? Yeah.

3
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:22,285
Almost.

4
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:37,765
Yeah. I'm ready.

5
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:57,565
Let's do it.

6
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:18,965
Mr. Porter.

7
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:21,445
What's up buddy? Any thoughts, brother? We're rolling.

8
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:26,405
Um, I'd like to thank Jesus and small puppies,

9
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:30,445
and kids who have cancer, because they are what

10
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:33,245
give me inf… (mumbmbles) in… and, and beer.

11
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:36,805
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

12
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,375
Chris Porter!

13
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,665
What's up, Kansas City? How you doing?

14
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:05,505
Sit down. Have a seat.

15
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:09,985
Uh, it's good to be back. I just got back

16
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:11,025
from southern Florida.

17
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:13,385
Hell yeah. Holy shit,

18
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:18,225
the old people… are fucking everywhere!

19
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,185
Old people in southern Florida are like,

20
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:24,785
Mexicans are everywhere else.

21
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:29,385
You know what I'm saying? There's a lot of them.

22
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,825
But you know how Mexicans are cool and funny

23
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:36,425
and sometimes they can get you weed.

24
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:40,465
Yeah. Old people are the exact opposite.

25
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,345
They are mean and rude.

26
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:47,065
They don't give a shit about you or your crosswalk.

27
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:54,305
And I'm thinking, "Hey, old people!

28
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,465
If you're that close to death,

29
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:58,745
maybe you should be on your best behavior.

30
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,845
You know What I'm saying? Like a little kid right

31
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:04,045
before Christmas, your big days are coming.

32
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,085
Maybe You should finish strong."

33
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:14,125
You know? Maybe let me outta the elevator

34
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,605
before you clip me in the ankles with your fucking scooter.

35
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:27,285
Spent most of the day watching my new favorite show on MTV.

36
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:29,765
It's called "Engaged and Underage." Have you seen it?

37
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,285
It's hysterical. It's kids under the age of 21

38
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:34,445
and they're getting married.

39
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,645
They should rename it to, "Hey, Look,

40
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:38,845
We're Fucking Up Our Lives."

41
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:43,805
No one seems to give a shit.

42
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,565
In fact, mom and dad are financing it.

43
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,085
Why do you wanna get married under the age of 21?

44
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,325
What the fuck is wrong with you?

45
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:56,645
The government doesn't even trust you with beer yet.

46
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:01,845
Maybe that's a sign you're not ready for a life decision.

47
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,245
You don't know shit about yourself at the age of 20,

48
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:07,605
'cause you know you're growing up.

49
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:09,485
You hit plateaus in life where you change.

50
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,925
You know? You hit bigger ones when you get older.

51
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,925
Like when you're 50, the day shows up where you're a dude.

52
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,165
You're like, "Hey, fuck it. Shorts and loafers."

53
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:20,845
You do that. That's a good look.

54
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:24,165
Or if you're an 80-year-old woman,

55
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,685
apparently the day shows up

56
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:26,885
where you're like, "Yeah, fuck you.

57
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:27,605
I've got a beard.

58
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,445
It's white and it's wispy. Call me Santa.

59
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,765
I don't give a shit. I'm eating.

60
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:42,085
I'm just happy you're talking to me."

61
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,285
You hit a lot of those plateaus between the ages

62
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:52,485
of 20 and 35.

63
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:54,885
I've recently hit one.

64
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,885
I don't talk to stupid people anymore.

65
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:02,285
I know, I know. Even if I wanted to fuck you.

66
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,405
Remember those days? I mean, there was a day when I was 25.

67
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:11,125
Ladies, you could have said the dumbest shit in the world

68
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:12,685
and I would've agreed with you.

69
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:15,965
I've been like, "Fuck yeah! Coldplay's awesome.

70
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:19,005
They're The best!"

71
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,525
Now I can't do it. Something happened 26 years old.
,
71
00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:27.365
My ears and my dick got connected.

72
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:34,325
Now if you say some stupid shit, it quits working. It does.

73
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,165
If you ask me who Led Zeppelin is,

74
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,685
I can't pee for like an hour.

75
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,565
You drink Red Bull with your liquor.

76
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:50,365
I don't even approach you anymore. I know, I know.

77
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:54,885
Fucking stop it for all of you guys girls, stop it.

78
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,245
Stop mixing the Red Bull with the liquor.

79
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:01,245
There's reason that your body shuts down when you've

80
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,325
had too much to drink.

81
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,365
It's 'cause you need to shut the fuck up, okay?

82
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,245
Your body has taken a vote

83
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:21,045
and decided your face needs to quit it.

84
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,765
That's why when you pass out, your arms are like this.

85
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,485
'cause you fucking tackled yourself.

86
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:31,445
You're like, "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

87
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:39,085
It's three in the morning. Shut up,

88
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,885
okay? I don't want to talk anymore. It's three."

89
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:45,885
There's two things to do at three in the morning: Sleep…

90
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:50,245
and fuck. And that's it, right? Guess what?

91
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,605
Second one's not gonna be very good. You know why?

92
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,485
Because it's three in the morning.

93
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:59,765
That's why! You wanna talk to me at one,

94
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:04,005
I had to rock your world. It's three

95
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:08,725
now. I'm tired and grumpy. I did shit today.

96
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,205
If you live in an apartment complex,

97
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:21,925
you know the people that drink Red Bull,

98
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,085
'cause they don't park their cars,

99
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,525
they just slam 'em into shit.

100
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,525
(crash sounds) Lock it!

101
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,565
You know why these kids are getting married?

102
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:50,485
'cause these girls won't fuck 'em

103
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:54,805
until they get married, which is fine.

104
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:57,925
Ladies, if you wanna hold back the poon, God bless you.

105
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:03,005
But lemme tell you something, shit's gonna happen, okay?

106
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:07,085
If you put an obstacle in front of a 20 year-old virgin

107
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:10,165
and tell him that pussy is on the other side,

108
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,125
shit's gonna get done.

109
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:15,645
Okay? Marriage. What's that? A trip to the mall.

110
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,605
That's easy! He was going there anyway.

111
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,805
You know, why don't you think about the rest of us, ladies.

112
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,165
If you wield that kind of power,

113
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:25,685
why don't you think about society for a change?

114
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,245
How about, hey, I'm not fucking anybody

115
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,285
till they cure cancer.

116
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:38,645
It'll be two weeks. Some 20-year-old will be like, "I got it!

117
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,285
I got it right here! Right here!

118
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:51,765
It was carrots and mustard. Who knew?

119
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:54,845
No one had ever mixed them. 'cause they're gross.

120
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:59,805
But I'll work on AIDS next week,

121
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,285
but right I now I need a blow job,
122
00:09:01.435 --> 00:09:04.725
okay? Then we'll cure your brother."

122
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:18,085
So I flew back from Florida. I was stopped in Atlanta.

123
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:21,165
I didn't want to, it's Delta's fault.

124
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,605
I was at an airport. I was at a McDonald's.

125
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:28,245
and the gentleman in front of me got his order

126
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:29,445
and it was incorrect.

127
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:34,125
And he was pissed. He was fucking pissed.

128
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:39,285
Like someone had dinged his Prius. He was angry.

129
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:42,485
And I just looked at him like, What's your level

130
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,845
of expectation at McDonald's?

131
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:49,245
Like, how angry can you get? Because yeah, yeah,

132
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,005
He fucked up your order. He did that. Yeah.

133
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,845
He fucked up his life three years ago.

134
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,725
Okay, he's got enough problems.

135
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,685
He workS at the airport McDonald's.

136
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,645
He can't even lie and say it's close to his house,

137
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:03,525
'cause it's not it's at the airport!

138
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,925
Just saying, give the guy a break,

139
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,245
you know? He's having a bad enough day.

140
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:12,885
He was gonna shoot himself in the face,

141
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,645
but they took his gun away at the checkpoint."

142
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,365
I just don't know why people get angry over stupid shit.

143
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:24,685
People get mad in traffic. I understand

144
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:26,845
if it's, like, a Saturday and you're on the Plaza

145
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:28,285
and some retard won't turn

146
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:32,565
left. I get that.

147
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:34,685
But Tuesday at 8:30 in the

148
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:35,725
morning, you can't get pissed.

149
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:38,485
People act like it's the first time the shit ever happened,

150
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,805
you know? "It's Tuesday at 8:30 in the morning.

151
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:42,085
What are all these cars doing here?"

152
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:48,165
So they honked her horns. Has that ever worked?

153
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:50,605
Have you ever been in gridlock?

154
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,245
And they're like, honk, honk. And everyone started

155
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:53,285
doing 70 again?!?

156
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,845
Like there are 15 stoners up at the front going, "Oh, shit!

157
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,565
Sorry! Sorry! My bad!

158
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:07,885
My bad. I was fucking with my iPod."

159
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:16,405
But I realized something.

160
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:18,245
It's always the same people

161
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,405
that honk their horns in traffic.

162
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,885
It's always people in shitty cars.

163
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,525
I'm not trying to be mean, but think about it.

164
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,165
Everyone in this room knows

165
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,765
what a shitty car horn sounds like.

166
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:33,805
You'll be sitting at home, you'll hear, "Meep! Meep!" "Fucking Festiva!

167
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:36,605
Where is it? Where is it?

168
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,365
It's got a spoiler. It's a '96."

169
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,885
What kind of sound does Rolls-Royce horn make?

170
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:52,925
I don't know either. No one knows.

171
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,725
Not even people who own a Rolls-Royce.

172
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:55,765
They're not even driving the thing.

173
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,325
They're sitting in back smoking weed, listening to Zeppelin.

174
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:03,565
That's what I would do if I had a Rolls-Royce.

175
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,365
The people who honk their horns in traffic are the people

176
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,525
who run out of object and it hits 'em.

177
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:13,325
They're just like, "I got a shitty car,

178
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:17,045
shitty job, shitty life.

179
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:23,285
Meep, Meep, motherfuckers! Meep, Meep!

180
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:27,885
Look At me! Look at me! Meep! Look at me!

181
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,845
I'm covered in Axe Body Spray.

182
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:38,365
I am listening to Nickelback. Shit

183
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,165
has taken a turn for the worse."

184
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:50,805
Nickelback.

185
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,725
Whoever thought there were a band come out

186
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,125
that made Creed look awesome?!?

187
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,245
See sir, there was this band called Creed and they came out

188
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:05,565
and they were like really whiny rock.

189
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:09,045
And um, everyone's like, "Get them outta here!"

190
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,365
Then they left and Nickelback showed up

191
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,405
and everyone was like, "Call Creed.""

192
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:18,325
Uh, someone needs to take me higher than Nickelback.

193
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:30,525
And Axe Body Spray. I've said it before, "Fucking stop it!

194
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:36,165
Stop it. All of you," because, girls, you're part to blame

195
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:37,645
'cause you're fucking these dudes.

196
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,365
You are! You are! 'cause if you weren't,

197
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:41,605
the shit wouldn't sell would it?

198
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:44,045
But it's selling like hotcakes.

199
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,005
And ladies, you deserve better.

200
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:48,045
You deserve better than some douche bag

201
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,645
that spent four bucks at Walgreens.

202
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,245
Axe Body Spray is proof positive that we

203
00:13:57,345 --> 00:14:00,445
as Americans will buy whatever the fuck comes on television.

204
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,125
Okay? They've got us now. They know it.

205
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,325
You know what's coming out next? Poop in a Box!

206
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:08,565
That's what's next. You're gonna be watching tv.

207
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:11,005
There's gonna be a closeup of Poop in a Box.

208
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:12,685
Then they're gonna pull back

209
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,685
and there's gonna be a hot girl dancing

210
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,125
next to Poop in a Box.

211
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:19,885
And every single pop collared douche bag in the country

212
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,725
is gonna go, "Holy shit!

213
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,605
Maybe if I have Poop in a Box,

214
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,365
a pretty girl dance next to me."

215
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:30,605
But they're gonna run out and they're gonna jump in their

216
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:35,405
Scion and halfway

217
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,245
to Walgreens common sense is gonna kick in.

218
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:41,925
They're gonna go, "Wait a minute… I have a box."

219
00:14:57,115 --> 00:15:01,525
Axe Body Spray is a regression as a society. Okay?

220
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,565
Every time someone uses it, we all take a step backwards.

221
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,645
Because I want you to think about it.

222
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,165
Up until this moment in human history,

223
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:12,685
even the shittiest colognes in the world did not come

224
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,045
in an aerosol can.

225
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:17,485
They didn't. They didn't. They didn't.

226
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:25,085
Old Spice, Aqua Velva, Hai Karate.

227
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:31,845
They all still had enough balls to have a spritzer.

228
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:35,525
And now, we've got the Aquanet of colognes…

229
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:42,485
And everyone knows somebody that uses it. You do.

230
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:45,005
Right before you walked in here tonight, they're like,

231
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:54,845
"I'm ready."

232
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,765
But no one had left the car yet.

233
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:03,005
So now all your friends smell like date rape.

234
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,405
I asked my friend why he did it. I go, "Why do you do that?

235
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,885
Why do you cover yourself in that shit?"

236
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:21,445
He said, "I don't wanna smell like pot and beer." "Why not?

237
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,005
You know, we've got pot and beer.

238
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:29,605
Let's advertise. because I'm gonna tell you something.

239
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,325
A girl does not like pot and beer…

240
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,445
She's not gonna like us at all."

241
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:46,525
So I'm single.

242
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,805
Shocker. What's with that? Mr.

243
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:58,325
Picky. Sucks being single and a guy.

244
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,965
It's fun for girls. It's nothing but free

245
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:05,805
drinks and attention. Yeah. For dudes, it's having a penis

246
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:06,925
and nowhere to put it,

247
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:11,845
Girls don't know what that's like.

248
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,325
They have a vagina. Yeah.

249
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:15,845
Walk the earth long enough, someone's gonna fuck you.

250
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,325
It's just a matter time

251
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,925
of you lowering your standards a little

252
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:22,925
bit.

253
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:30,005
If you got a penis, there's no guarantees anymore.

254
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:33,605
You gotta have something else to accentuate your penis.

255
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:37,765
Like a car or a

256
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,965
job. $40.

257
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:42,475
Something. You

258
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:43,385
know?

259
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,645
Penis needs an ad campaign like, Penis:
262
00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:48.765
It's what's for dinner.

260
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:58,005
Have it your way. Is it in you?"

261
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:06,845
Because we're going up against a superior product.

262
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:09,165
You gotta look at it from a marketing standpoint.

263
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:12,285
The vagina's perfect. It's symmetrical.

264
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:16,445
It's like a little pocket. I'm gonna lick it.

265
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:21,365
I'm gonna put things in there. Like

266
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:26,245
my penis, or my tongue, or the title to my truck.

267
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:30,005
Only shit I care about. Only shit I

268
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:31,005
care.

269
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:34,845
I'd ask her first. You know,

270
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:37,485
can just can't go shoving shit up there.

271
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:38,605
They hate that. They

272
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:39,605
hate that.

273
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,725
That's rape in a lot of counties.

274
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:45,645
Who needs that on your record? You know what I'm saying?

275
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:48,445
Gotta start telling people when you move and shit.

276
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,205
I'm just gonna say, you gotta feel

277
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:55,245
like a douche on that day.

278
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,685
You know? "Hey, I touch a little girl. Sorry!"

279
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,365
Kind of like the day you buy a yellow Hummer, you know?

280
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,325
Yeah. I said it fucking, are you serious?

281
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,285
Are you, do you need a yellow hummer? Really? Really?

282
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,045
How small is your dick? Really?

283
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,645
That small? You're that small.

284
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:21,765
Really? I understand. Buy a Hummer.

285
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:26,165
I love rap music. I love it. Why a yellow one?

286
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,165
It's not even attractive.

287
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,805
It's like, "Hey, look! I'm driving the sun

288
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:32,725
and I got a small penis."

289
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,765
So this is all new to me, being single.

290
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:43,125
I dated a girl for three years and I learned some shit.

291
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:47,485
Like if you're gonna do that, she should like you.

292
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:53,245
Like as a person. This girl would yell at me

293
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:56,405
'cause she ran outta shit to do not like it was my fault.

294
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,285
We'd be going to bed. She'd be like, "Oh,

295
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,405
there's nothing on TV.

296
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:04,485
Let's fuck with you for a while." Like, "Oh, damn you Nick
300
00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:09.445
at Nite!" I

297
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:11,005
woke up in the middle of an argument.

298
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:16,085
How does that happen ladies?!? Ever?

299
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:18,485
I've been asleep six hours.

300
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:21,085
"You listen to me, you cocksucker!"

301
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,125
I didn't know what the hell was going on.

302
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:29,405
I thought she was on her cell phone. I started laughing.

303
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,245
I was like, "Listen to this poor son of a bitch!"

304
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:42,005
It was me. So I

305
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:44,245
broke up with her, a lot.

306
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:50,405
'cause I'm an idiot. I did. I am. I'm like, "I'll call her."

307
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:52,125
I'll be like, "You're fucking crazy. Don't call me.

308
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,725
We're over. Bye!" She called me the next day, "I'm not crazy."

309
00:20:56,025 --> 00:21:00,685
"Oh, my bad! See you in 20."

310
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:04,845
So I finally got away from it, right? Then

311
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:08,445
it took me like a year just to talk to women. I was scared.

312
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,485
I was scarred. That was more like it.

313
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:12,525
Women would come up to me after shows

314
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:13,965
and they'd be like, "Hey, how you doing?"

315
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:15,965
I'd be like, "I don't want to argue. Peace."

316
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:26,605
But I moved on and I started dating again

317
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,205
and I was terrible at it.

318
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:31,165
'cause everything had changed. The scene had changed.

319
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:34,045
You gotta go to a club now, which is retarded.

320
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,765
'cause clubs are dark and loud.

321
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:38,965
You end up walking out like, "Oh, shit! All right.

322
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:43,885
Sorry! Sorry. No, we're cool. We're cool.

323
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,805
We're gonna have to stop by a liquor store. But I'm cool."

324
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:56,005
Can't talk to 'em. Music's so loud.

325
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:58,565
It's like, "Hey, how are you?" "What?!?" "I said, 'What's your name?'"

326
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:03,645
"What?!" "You wanna fuck?" "What?!?" "Like here. I wanna do this… later."

327
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,165
This is what I want to do… later."

328
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:06,485
That's what you do in a club.

329
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:08,765
You just rub your dick on chicks until one sticks around.

330
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:14,805
"This is what I want to do. Rubby, rubby, rub, rub!"

331
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:19,645
Girls go! They fucking love it.

332
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:21,365
They're like, "I had eight dicks rubbed on me tonight!

333
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:22,805
This is my lucky outfit." (whip noise)

334
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:23,725
You know?

335
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,325
And apparently, if you want to date a girl now,

336
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:33,885
before you even talk to one,

337
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,885
you gotta call your cell phone company

338
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,165
and get a text messaging plan.

339
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:43,925
Holy shit ladies. What the fuck?

340
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:50,445
It's a phone. It's a phone. It's a fucking phone.

341
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,645
Press talk. How about it, huh?

342
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:55,525
If you want to talk, press the button

343
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:57,165
that says the shit that you wanna do.

344
00:22:58,385 --> 00:22:59,805
I'm not anti-text message.

345
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,325
Me and my buddies text message each other all the time.

346
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:06,565
But it's a message. It's one line that needs no answer.

347
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:10,245
Shit like, "Meet me here," or "I'm running late,"

348
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:13,925
or, "That girl you're talking to is fucking nasty!" Shit like

349
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:14,925
that.

350
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:22,325
Don't look at me like that. 'cause girls do it too.

351
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:25,005
Doesn't matter what sex you are.

352
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,765
Doesn't even matter what your sexual orientation is.

353
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:29,765
If you've ever been hitting on somebody

354
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:31,365
and shit was going well

355
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,965
and then they looked at their phone, looked at you

356
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:41,525
and walked away, somebody has just reached out

357
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:42,645
and cockblocked you.

358
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:52,485
You know what cockblocking is, sir?

359
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:54,575
Don't Pick on me! No,

360
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:57,885
I'm just asking. I I, I'm not picking on you.

361
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,885
I'm just asking. You're not really in my

362
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:01,045
demo, you know what I'm saying?

363
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:03,525
I'm just making sure I'm crossing over.

364
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,565
If you don't know what cock-

365
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:08,885
blocking is, I'll explain it to you,

366
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:10,725
'cause it's a funny joke. You should not get it,

367
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,765
just 'cause you're unfamiliar with the verbiage.

368
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:16,085
Say, me and this guy right here, we're friends.

369
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:17,485
We're gonna go out for a night on the town,

370
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:18,605
try to score some tail.

371
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:22,365
'cause it's 1942 and people still talk like that.

372
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:27,285
So Jimmy and I hop out of the DeLorean

373
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:28,325
And uh,

374
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:33,125
mosey into the speakeasy.

375
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:36,085
Jimmy sees this girl here.

376
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:37,645
He goes, "I'm gonna go hit on that girl." I go, "Sweet!

377
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:40,085
I'm gonna go to the bar, check out the rest of the talent."

378
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:44,045
Awesome. I go to the bar, get my beer, turn around, realize

379
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:46,085
that Jimmy's hitting on the hottest chick in the place.

380
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,085
And I can't let that happen.

381
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:48,565
'cause I'm number one, he's number two.

382
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:51,525
That's just how it works. I gotta get Jimmy out of the way.

383
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:54,045
How do I do it? I go, "Hey, Jimmy! How's the herpes?

384
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:58,765
You flaring?" That's

385
00:24:58,765 --> 00:24:59,765
how dudes do it.

386
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,405
Girls are a lot better at it.

387
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,165
You never see these bitches coming.

388
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,725
You'll have a friend post it up, right?

389
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:07,885
And she's totally into you.

390
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:08,925
She's like, "I'm gonna take you home.

391
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,445
I'm gonna suck on every inch of your body

392
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,885
and bring you to a level of ecstasy you've never achieved."

393
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:17,165
Awesome outta nowhere. Friend's like, "Hey, we're leaving!"

394
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:18,925
She's like, "See ya!" And they're gone.

395
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:26,765
What the fuck was that?

396
00:25:28,505 --> 00:25:31,125
Did you see that? Some sort of cockblocking ninja.

397
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:33,205
She came out of nowhere.

398
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,405
The girls wanna conversate via the text message.

399
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,405
You ever gotten a text message from a girl?

400
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:48,045
Holy shit, nothing but questions. "Hey, how are you?

401
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,245
What are you doing? What are you doing later?

402
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:51,525
What are you thinking? Beepbopboopbopbeepbopbeep!"

403
00:25:51,525 --> 00:25:51,685
"Uhh…

404
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,965
I'm fine. Kind of wishing you didn't have thumbs right now,

405
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,365
because then, maybe we could talk."

406
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:06,685
Because girls are so efficient with the phones.

407
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:08,725
You ever seen a girl with a 10 button phone?

408
00:26:09,215 --> 00:26:11,205
She's like a goddamnn court stenographer.

409
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:15,125
Beepbopbopbop… How about Wednesday? You wanna go to the beach?" (typing sounds)

410
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:19,245
Every text message I send takes seven minutes.

411
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:24,965
F… seven…

412
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:28,125
I don't need a seven.

413
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:32,885
Meanwhile, she's freaking out.

414
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,725
"Why aren't you texting me back? You seen somebody else?

415
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:37,005
What's going on?" "No, I'm fucking retarded! Shut up!

416
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:39,245
Shut up!"

417
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:47,365
You end up calling her. "Gimme five minutes.

418
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:49,565
Just gimme five fucking minutes. Okay?

419
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:51,165
Hey, hey, I'm on the phone…

420
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,765
Just tell me what you were gonna type. Was it 'JK?'

421
00:26:54,065 --> 00:26:57,285
Was it 'LOL?' Was it 'semi colon closed parenthesis?'

422
00:26:57,285 --> 00:27:01,765
What the fuck was it? I'm not

423
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,085
as good at this as you are."

424
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:10,045
Because you don't know how unfair it is, ladies.

425
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:12,765
You don't know what it's like to talk to you.

426
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,245
You talk to each other. That's different 'cause you're women.

427
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:20,165
You got the pheromones and the estrogen

428
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,445
and the vaginas and whatever.

429
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:24,965
I don't even think you need to talk to each other.

430
00:27:25,085 --> 00:27:26,525
I think you're doing it just to fuck with us,

431
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,005
to be honest with you. See?!? Look!

432
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:30,845
They're all looking at each other, aren't they?

433
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,965
Yeah. Yeah. I'm onto something!

434
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,645
You're gonna find me gagged out in a dumpster with tampons.

435
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:39,445
I, yeah, a woman mafia got me. That's what happened there.

436
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,125
I'm gonna be Hoffa in this bitch.

437
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:57,325
It's hard. It's hard to talk

438
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,045
to you ,'cause you're all unique.

439
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,165
You're all individual. You all have your own little shit

440
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:03,605
that makes you fucking crazy.

441
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,485
You do. You do. That's why your date's not laughing.

442
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:11,045
Yeah, because if it wasn't true, he'd laugh. He'd laugh.

443
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:13,125
He'd be, "This stuff's crazy. I don't know what he's talking about…"

444
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:16,285
But no, he is like, "Hey Fuckhead, it's Saturday.

445
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:20,645
Let's not cockblock. Okay, let's not bring up the crazy.

446
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:25,645
She's doing good." Because you do.

447
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,885
It's always something weird. It's always something crazy

448
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:32,005
like, "Don't say toast. I hate that word." Like, "What?!?"

449
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:34,765
"When I was younger I had a bad experience with toast

450
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,845
and I am just not comfortable enough with you

451
00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:39,685
and I to tell you the toast story yet.

452
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:42,645
But if you could just do me a favor and,

453
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:45,005
and just say 'baked bread,' that'd be super."

454
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:53,645
We gotta figure this shit out. It's not just one thing.

455
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:55,725
It's not just a dozen things. It's a million things.

456
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:58,845
And they're always changing. We never figure 'em all out.

457
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:02,565
I know this 'cause my dad has been married to my mom

458
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:07,445
for 30 years, and that man can still talk to that woman face

459
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:09,805
to face, piss her off

460
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:13,365
and have no idea how the fuck it happened, at all.

461
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,285
Dad's still trying to learn.

462
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,605
You'll see him in another room like 20 minutes later

463
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,605
reworking the whole scenario, trying

464
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:21,845
to figure out where he fucked up.

465
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:38,965
"Dad, what happened?" "I don't know! I don't know.

466
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,685
I got home from the store, fuckin' all hell broke loose!"

467
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:45,045
"Didja get everything on the list?"

468
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,685
"I got everything on the list, man.

469
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:48,885
Apparently there was a list I was unaware of.

470
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,125
And it was in her face."

471
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:58,725
Dad was smart. Dad realized Mom was pissed

472
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,645
and got the fuck out.

473
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:03,365
'cause that's what you're supposed to do.

474
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:05,645
He walked home, he was like, "Honey, I'm home."

475
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:08,285
And she's like, "Hey." He's like, "Fucking see ya! Bye!"

476
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:14,645
Because my father knows what most older men know

477
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:17,085
that: when a woman's mad for the first 20 minutes,

478
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:20,405
doesn't matter why. It doesn't.

479
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,125
It doesn't! You just get away from it.

480
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:26,445
It's like right before a tsunami. You don't ask questions.

481
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:28,565
You just walk out to the beach. You're like, "Oh, shit!

482
00:30:28,665 --> 00:30:30,285
All the water's gone. Fucking run.

483
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:35,925
Fucking run." Because you

484
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:38,365
don't wanna be the dude standing on the beach going, "Hey,

485
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:39,485
where'd all the water go?

486
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:44,365
Something's wrong. We need to figure this out.

487
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,565
We need to stick around here.

488
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:47,805
Figure out where all the water went.

489
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:52,965
Hey, is that a starfish? Oh, shit!"

490
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,285
You know, now you want us to text you

491
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,445
Kind of fucked, aren't we?

492
00:31:05,745 --> 00:31:08,645
You know? 'cause there's no sarcasm, fa. That's a problem.

493
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:10,765
I'm trying to be funny

494
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:13,045
and T-Mobile makes me look like a dickhead.

495
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:16,845
"I meant like, 'No, I meant, "Your sister was a whore,"'

496
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:19,925
like 'wocka, wocka, wocka,' right? Nothing?

497
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:24,925
Alright. Nothing?

498
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:30,045
Alright." Are you guys drinking? Yeah.

499
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:35,325
Fuck Yeah. It's Saturday. We're in a mall. Fuck it.

500
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:35,765
Right?

501
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:42,645
Let's get shit-faced

502
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:44,645
and go break into Black House/White Market.

503
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:55,205
I don't know what I would get from there. Maybe some gifts.

504
00:31:56,835 --> 00:31:59,405
Well drink up. Drive home real fast. It'll be sweet.

505
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:02,165
Uh, see if the Lord loves you,

506
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:06,595
That's funny, eh?

507
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:08,805
Do y'all go to church?

508
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:12,605
Some of you? Some of you like, "Fuck you, dude.

509
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:17,485
Trying to have fun here. There's

510
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,845
no 'G-O-D' in 'F-U-N.' Know what

511
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:20,845
I'm saying?"

512
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:24,365
I'm not saying that. But grammatically, if

513
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:25,525
that's correct, you know what I'm saying?

514
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,205
Grammatically means words.

515
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:34,365
Basically what I'm saying is there's not a 'G' or an 'O'

516
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:36,405
or a 'D' in the word,

517
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:36,765
'fun.'

518
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:48,285
I was raised Catholic. Any Catholics here? Yeah.

519
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:50,725
Surprise that many of 'em clapped.

520
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:52,405
Usually they don't wanna put their beers down.

521
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,525
Alright if I set this here? Go right ahead. Cool.

522
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:04,645
Don't spit it in or nothin'. Catholicism's great.

523
00:33:04,645 --> 00:33:08,325
Especially if you do drink. 'cause uh, we have noon masses.

524
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,885
Yeah, that's the latest in the industry.

525
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:13,445
Some churches have a five o'clock,

526
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:15,725
'cause they have like a cokehead contingency or something.

527
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:17,045
I don't know. But it's like…

528
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,085
Because Catholics like to drink.

529
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:23,405
We love it. That's why Catholic masses are so boring.

530
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:26,485
A lot of people think we lack soul. That's incorrect.

531
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:27,965
We're just fucking hung over.

532
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:31,205
Because you go to a lot of churches,

533
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:32,885
they're having a blast, man.

534
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,405
They're like, "Yay, Jesus! Whee, tee, teetee, tee!"

535
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:41,045
Catholics, we're like, "Cut that shit off! Shut up!

536
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:43,205
Okay, I got a headache.

537
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:46,725
Let's just sit here and let this dude talk. Okay?"

538
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:49,205
It's not even the priest.

539
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,525
Priest doesn't do shit for the first 20 minutes.

540
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:53,645
He's as hung over as anybody else in here.

541
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:13,365
If you've never been to a Catholic mass,

542
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:14,485
it's about an hour long.

543
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,365
Sometimes you can get out in 45.

544
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:20,725
There's this variable in the middle called 'the homily,'

545
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,365
Where the priest can just talk about whatever he feels

546
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:25,725
is relevant.

547
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:27,925
And uh, sometimes he's really succinct

548
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:29,405
and gets to the point and gets out.

549
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:32,125
And you out there in 45 other days he goes fucking

550
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:33,165
Allman brothers on it.

551
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:36,085
You know what I'm saying? Takes him 20 minutes

552
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:37,205
to bring it back to 'Whipping

553
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:37,445
Post.'

554
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:46,405
First half an hour of any Catholic mass is,

555
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:48,045
like anybody else's church, where they talk

556
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,485
to you, they sing to you.

557
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:51,365
You know, (sings) "Touching yourself.

558
00:34:52,935 --> 00:34:57,205
Jesus doesn't love you when you're touching yourself," right?

559
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,205
I'm paraphrasing, but that's the gist of it.

560
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:04,645
And uh, the second half an hour is like a

561
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:05,965
cooking show with Jesus.

562
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:09,125
'cause they take crackers and turn them

563
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,205
into the 'Body of Christ.'

564
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:13,245
Then they take a $4 bottle of wine

565
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:14,845
and turn it into the 'Blood of Christ.'

566
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:19,045
Yeah, super cool the first couple times, but two

567
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:20,565
or three years into it you're kind of like,

568
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:23,485
"Hey, Padre, what else can you make?

569
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:27,165
You know? Is there a lasagna or something?

570
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:31,765
Because I'd love a 'Cheesy Jesus.' That'd be delicious."

571
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:40,125
I quit going to church and it's not 'cause I got lazy.

572
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:42,245
It's 'cause one week I showed up

573
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:44,725
and no one at my church would drink the wine.

574
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,125
'cause the flu was going around.

575
00:35:49,995 --> 00:35:54,765
Where's the faith? You know, if I had the flu,

576
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,485
I'd be bogarting the Blood of Christ.

577
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:58,845
You know what I mean? Like, "Fuck you, bitches! I got the flu."

578
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:00,205
Gluck, gluck, gluck, gluck.

579
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:03,605
"It's the Blood of Christ, according to all your stories.

580
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:04,925
It saved us from sin.

581
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:07,005
I think it's gonna do something for my sniffle."

582
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:18,205
I'm just saying if you're gonna go

583
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:21,565
to a building every Saturday or Sunday or Wednesday or

584
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:24,205
whenever the hell you go… you should believe

585
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:25,525
what these people are telling you.

586
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:29,925
Otherwise, what are you doing? Missing kickoff, basically.

587
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:37,925
And I don't care what religion you are, I don't care.

588
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:40,245
Just believe whatever you wanna believe, we're all wrong.

589
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:46,205
That's okay. Religions aren't there to be correct.

590
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,685
They're there to be there. They're there

591
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:48,725
to give you something to believe in.

592
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:51,925
So believe in it. That's why, of all the religions,

593
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:54,405
the people I respect the most are the people down in Texas

594
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,965
that dance around with rattlesnakes on their heads.

595
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,485
Those people are fucking crazy!

596
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:02,365
They believe! You got to.

597
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:04,565
You got a fucking rattlesnake on your head.

598
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,645
Dancing around with it, asking it questions.

599
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:11,485
"Lord Jesus, should I buy a Honda?" (snake biting head) "No!

600
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,605
No, I shouldn't. Oh, shit!

601
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:17,875
Shit!

602
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:23,285
Shit! Zeke? Come here. Shit! Zeke?

603
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:28,285
Go tell everybody. Jesus said, 'Buy American.'

604
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:30,425
That's what He said."

605
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:31,005
(Laughter and applause)

606
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:35,045
Don't let my death be in vain.

607
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:43,125
Gotta kind of hope that the rattlesnake people aren't right.

608
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:46,885
'cause that means there's rattlesnakes in heaven.

609
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,205
If there's snakes in heaven, you know what's in hell.

610
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:54,165
Llamas. Right?

611
00:37:54,785 --> 00:37:58,485
Two Ls in hell, two Ls in llama.

612
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:09,205
I smoke pot.

613
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:16,925
I do it a lot. That's

614
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:18,565
what I was doing when I wrote the llama joke.

615
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:21,805
I thought it was brilliant. I was

616
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:22,845
like, "Who does a two 'L' joke?

617
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:27,445
Fucking nobody. I'm Lewis and Clark

618
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:31,365
in this bitch." They were pioneers.

619
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,645
Pot's my favorite drug. It's the only drug I do,

620
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:41,165
besides Xanax and mushrooms.

621
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:48,045
I love Xanax, man. That shit's like the reset button. It is.

622
00:38:48,045 --> 00:38:50,125
If you're having a shitty day, take a Xanax.

623
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:52,165
Next thing you know, it's tomorrow.

624
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:59,645
"What the hell happened yesterday?" "Dunno! I don't know.

625
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:00,885
It was shitty to a point.

626
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:04,165
And then, apparently, I went to Taco Bell."

627
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:10,005
Which, by the way, don't get stoned and eat a Xanax.

628
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:14,085
Holy shit! That's an $18 run for the border.

629
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,045
You're a little too fucked up for choices.

630
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:21,845
You just kind of pull up to the drive-thru.

631
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:24,525
"I'll take the left side. No tomatoes. Thank you.

632
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,485
We will sort it out at the house.

633
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:40,645
I need to get this vehicle off the road, ASAP!"

634
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:50,765
Oh, cool. I've been dating again,

635
00:39:50,945 --> 00:39:52,845
and uh, they, I got this thing.

636
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:54,885
I've been getting them, and then I put a stop to 'em.

637
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:57,125
I don't if you start doing it, I'd tell you, "No."

638
00:39:57,585 --> 00:39:59,445
And I'm here to put a stop to 'em publicly.

639
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,325
And they're called 'handjobs.'

640
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:05,925
Yeah. Ladies, we don't need them.

641
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:09,525
We don't need 'em. I don't need 'em.

642
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:11,605
I don't wanna speak for everybody. Maybe you're into it.

643
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,085
I am not. Okay. I don't.

644
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:15,525
Ladies, if we hook up later, uh,

645
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:18,885
and you were gonna do that, rub my back.

646
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,085
You know? Gimme a back rub,

647
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,245
because, uh, I can't reach my back.

648
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:37,445
I can do that a lot better than you can. I might add, ladies.

649
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,085
Holy shit, fellas. You ever gotten a handjob?!? There's

650
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:42,885
15 minutes you'll never get back.

651
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,205
Just laying there, staring at each other.

652
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:14,405
"What's that, baby? What's that? No, no,

653
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:18,845
it doesn't usually take this long. No, it doesn't. You look tired."

654
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:25,445
I am just saying, ladies, if that's what you wanna do,

655
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:26,845
you're just kind of doing some shit

656
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:28,285
that we haven't gotten to today.

657
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:33,285
If that's what you wanna do, go iron my shirt.

658
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:38,045
I'm not trying to be mean. I'm not trying to be sexist.

659
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,565
I'd go iron my shirt while you're doing this, but I can't.

660
00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:44,005
I gotta be here for this. So let me do this.

661
00:41:44,025 --> 00:41:46,565
You go do… Let's be productive is what I'm saying.

662
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:57,005
That's a weird joke. 'cause not everyone can laugh at it.

663
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,085
And the people, the groups that can't, are very divided.

664
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:02,765
Like the younger kids can't laugh at it

665
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:04,765
'cause they'd settle for that.

666
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:07,925
They'd be like, 'Yeah, if she's touching it,

667
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:09,445
I'm not complaining at all!"

668
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:12,245
And older dudes are the same way.

669
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:14,085
They're like, "Hey, she hasn't seen it in three months.

670
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:17,525
So if she would just touch it, it'll probably go off."

671
00:42:20,385 --> 00:42:22,885
Really, she doesn't even need to put a full wrap around it."

672
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:26,925
Are you ladies hearing this shit?

673
00:42:27,035 --> 00:42:28,205
It's fucking hysterical

674
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:33,005
and you're just staring at me, and you're the only ones,

675
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:34,445
so I'm starting to think it's you guys.

676
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:39,445
Something happen today? Your dog die?

677
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:44,205
You gotta take a poop? That happens to me sometimes.

678
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:45,445
Has that ever…, Like you had to

679
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:46,485
poop but you had shit to do,

680
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:50,845
so you held it 'cause you're an adult, and then you pooped

681
00:42:50,845 --> 00:42:52,045
and then you're like, "Fuck I've been

682
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:53,125
a dick for the last hour."

683
00:42:54,995 --> 00:42:57,085
Yeah, call people. "Sorry! Sorry!

684
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:58,845
Yeah, I had to poop and I didn't know it.

685
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:02,405
Totally forgot about the fact that I had to poop."

686
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:06,885
Well I'm gonna get outta here.

687
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:09,125
We're gonna go get stoned and listen to The Black Crowes,

688
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:10,805
'cause they're my most favorite band in the world.

689
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,005
I dunno if you've heard of them.

690
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:15,605
Yeah, I just went and saw 'em again.

691
00:43:15,605 --> 00:43:17,805
That's like 17 times the last two years.

692
00:43:17,935 --> 00:43:20,245
Which kind of makes me a dork. But fuck you.

693
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:23,645
I lead the life. Anyway,

694
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:25,085
They were broken up for two years

695
00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:26,325
so I didn't really get to see 'em.

696
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:28,685
So I tried to get to see 'em whenever I can and, um…

697
00:43:29,165 --> 00:43:30,765
'cause for the two years they were broken up.

698
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:33,485
The only way we could watch 'em was to watch

699
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:38,365
their Behind the Music, which I have on tape. One weekend,

700
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,445
me and my buddies got really fucking shitfaced.

701
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,485
Like, strip club shitfaced.

702
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:45,645
You know that? When it finally sounds like a good idea,

703
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:49,525
That's when you've had too much. Like, "Strip club?"

704
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:50,685
"Fuck yeah, let's go!"

705
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,765
"Gimme your keys."

706
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:57,445
'cause sober,

707
00:43:57,585 --> 00:44:00,045
I'm like, "Strip club. No. Fuck that. Let's go to the casino.

708
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:01,005
We might get it back."

709
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:06,765
I might get to fuck the dealer.

710
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:14,365
I bet she doesn't have a coke problem, either. You can laugh.

711
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:15,885
They're not here. This is their money night.

712
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:16,605
They're making money.

713
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:26,165
So one night we got really fucked up

714
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,245
and couldn't find the remote,

715
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:29,925
so we had to watch the commercials. It's an older tape.

716
00:44:29,955 --> 00:44:31,125
It's got older commercials.

717
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:33,205
It's got that old OB commercial on

718
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:35,205
there. That one with the lady.

719
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:37,565
She walks outta the laboratory and up to the camera.

720
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:38,845
She's like, "Did you know

721
00:44:39,155 --> 00:44:43,685
that the first tampon was developed by a man?"

722
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:50,085
What the hell is she asking me for?

723
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:52,845
Why would I know? I don't know.

724
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:55,485
Probably. You know, probably the first guy tired

725
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,405
of waking up in the middle of a crime scene.

726
00:45:02,955 --> 00:45:04,365
What? What?

727
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:08,285
What? Don't look at me like you don't know

728
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:09,405
what the hell I'm talking about.

729
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:15,205
Yeah, you call it 'spotting.' Yeah. I got news for you ladies,

730
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:16,605
that's fucking leaking.

731
00:45:19,765 --> 00:45:21,685
'Spotting' is what you do with a UFO.

732
00:45:25,835 --> 00:45:27,325
That makes me the 'spotter.'

733
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:28,965
I'm the one waking up in the middle of the night.

734
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:30,365
I don't know what the hell's going on.

735
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:32,565
I wake up, I look over, I'm like,

736
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:34,285
"Oh, my god! You've been shot!

737
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,445
Why'd they shoot you there? Of all places?

738
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:54,205
Were they mad at me? Because that was my favorite place.

739
00:45:59,065 --> 00:46:01,245
Why wouldn't they shoot you in the mouth or something?"

740
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:06,005
Like what? No. For efficiency, that's all.

741
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:09,045
If you're a hit man, your car gets asleep.

742
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,645
You don't go shooting her in the vadge.

743
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:14,485
That's mean… and unprofessional.

744
00:46:15,835 --> 00:46:17,205
That is bad hit man etiquette.

745
00:46:22,705 --> 00:46:24,845
You guys were cool, man. I did that joke last week,

746
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:25,845
this chick got pissedd.

747
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:32,925
She was angry. Stood up, started yelling shit out at me.

748
00:46:33,985 --> 00:46:38,325
"Why would you shoot her in the mouth?" I don't know.

749
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:51,405
Maybe 'cause questions answer themselves.

750
00:46:53,255 --> 00:46:55,805
Shout-out was funny, but she was drunk and didn't get it.

751
00:46:55,805 --> 00:46:56,885
She kept coming at me.

752
00:46:57,225 --> 00:46:58,845
"You don't go shooting her in the mouth.

753
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:03,405
Mouth can be just as good as a vagina." What?

754
00:47:06,885 --> 00:47:08,605
I mean, I've had some great blowjobs,

755
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,045
but I have yet to walk by an open vagina.

756
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:13,125
I wished would shut the fuck

757
00:47:13,225 --> 00:47:17,965
up! Kansas City.

758
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:20,125
You guys've been a lot of fun, man. Thank you so much for coming out.
