00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,240
we're going to talk about the first as

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,640
long as I can still remember them I

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,320
figured might be a good idea you know I

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,040
am I am working on my Memoirs and

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,640
working is is really the the operative

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,920
word there because it's it's uh I

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,159
collaborated with a guy named Brad

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,000
shriber I don't know if you know Brad

39
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,680
He's a comedy writer and an old old

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,759
friend of mine and uh he wrote the first

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,079
draft based on my ramblings like I'm

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
going to be doing with you guys today

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,320
and uh and then I got it back and I

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,159
looked at I said well this is funny but

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,680
it's not my voice so I have to I have to

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,880
make it my voice my voice well you know

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,119
and and also whichever voice you choose

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,560
to use of course there's spelling

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,159
mistakes you know and and and

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,079
misinterpretations of certain things

51
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,599
that I said and things happened so it's

52
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,720
it's a full-time job and I'm still

53
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,720
unfortunately or fortunately as a case

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,920
may be so busy in my professional life

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,599
and my personal life which I'm don't

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,680
talk that that I I'm finding it really

57
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,080
difficult to sit in front of the laptop

58
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,480
or put the laptop on my lap and you know

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,239
and get dive into it again but slowly

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,080
but surely slowly he turned into his own

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,280
you know and I'm figuring you know all

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,800
these people are coming out with their

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,319
Memoirs you know singers and actors and

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,040
all and and uh Jane Fawn for instance or

65
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,959
other people they say oh yeah it took me

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
10 years to write it and this and that

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,239
you so I don't feel so bad I figure

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,360
maybe next year it will come out in some

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,599
form or another probably by the time I

70
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,080
get it out it I'll be able to just send

71
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,080
it to your brain you know you can just

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,280
download it right into your cerebral

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,480
cortex you know or in my case maybe the

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,519
reptilian brain which is more suited to

75
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,760
the kind of life that I've LED you know

76
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,440
you're pretty good with you know

77
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,159
predicting future technology so I

78
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,440
wouldn't be surprised if that's if

79
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,519
that's not the the next thing I know uh

80
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,200
Peter Bergman and I when we were touring

81
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,400
uh were invited to connect with Marshall

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,440
mclen because he wanted to add more

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,959
comedy to his lectures and of course we

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,519
worshiped the man and his his genius and

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
foresight and one time uh he and oh and

86
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,720
and I only mentioned this because so

87
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,920
many of his predictions are still

88
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,159
manifesting you know uh but he invited

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,439

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,959

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,759
passed away soon thereafter from smoking

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,240
Cuban cigars I guess and great loss he

115
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,320
put put the load on the on theong yeah

116
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,680
right but you know he's that's one of

117
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,039
the people that you wish was still

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,400
around going like see I told you so or

119
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,720
even like you ain't seen nothing yet you

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,840
know you

121
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,960
know but he's gone and son the deputy

122
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,440
Deputy mclen my Marshall son uh he is is

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,440
keeping his dad's Legacy Alive by or had

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,400
been by publishing stuff that he had

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,240
written comic stuff that he' written

126
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,680
anyway uh I I mention that only because

127
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,080
uh there are going obviously going to be

128
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,039
some kind of platforms I already believe

129
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,479
that the whole social media thing is is

130
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,039
a precursor of telepathy sure you know

131
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,240
and and and help now my Memoirs are a

132
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,160
lot about telepathy you knew I was going

133
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,520
to say that I did I can feel it because

134
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,759
I've had actually open that envelope

135
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,759
under your chair oh no it's the King of

136
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:43,319
Diamonds oh my God thank you and it's

137
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,639
got poop on it oh my God that was my

138
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:50,400
poop oh amazing trick how you pulled

139
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,520
that right out of your ass no out of my

140
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,039
ass so anyway uh telepathy plays a great

141
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,319
deal and Serendipity one could call it

142
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,600
uh in in in my history my personal

143
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,479
real history and some of that will come

144
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,919
out during this our rambling

145
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,319
conversations because it I'm going to be

146
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,120
telling you the way things really

147
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,000
happened uh that that led to the the

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,039
creation of the fire sign theater into

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,240
the albums into our our career together

150
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,919
uh so we can start as you suggested with

151
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,360
waiting for the electrician or someone

152
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,880
like him yeah because I know you've been

153
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,680
waiting for the Proctor or something

154
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,560
like him to come and talk to you about

155
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,000
this uh that title came from Peter

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,599
bergman's experience in uh Amsterdam

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,440
when he was uh with the fool a group

158
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:47,240
called The Fool which was artistic

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,000
performance and and creative uh uh

160
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,400
costumes and paintings and psychedelic

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
car paintings and uh that the Beatles

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,879
Affiliated themselves with at a certain

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,840
point they used to drive around in one

164
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,720
of their the Fool's psychedelically

165
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,879
painted limos Etc ET and Bergman was was

166
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,400
the story which I I can only kind of

167
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,720
remember like most most of what I'll be

168
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,160
talking about was that Bergman was up on

169
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,240
a rooftop getting high because he that's

170
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,240
how you did it now all I had to do was

171
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,440
get up on the roof and you were high

172
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,759
because you just breathe in the air and

173
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,240
who marijuana everywhere so he's up on

174
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,520
the rooftop getting high and suddenly

175
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,759
there is a

176
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,280
blackout in in in his area of the city

177
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,800
oh not in his brain oh no oh no no come

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,520
to that point no not that enormous

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Bergman brain no no there were seldom

180
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,360
blackouts in that brain although I'll

181
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,520
tell you about a famous one that

182
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,400
happened when when I was present but

228
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,519
just the hottest thing on campus Because

229
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,240
the drama school was was kind of full of

230
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,040
the Old Guard uh the the the teachers

231
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,440
and the the head of the uh a guy named

232
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,360
Canon I think was the head of the school

233
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
at the time School of drama I remember

234
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,880
he came up to me after a show that that

235
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
I was in there and said Phil you got a

236
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,240
real bomb here a real bomb and because

237
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,760
in the old theatrical vernacular met hit

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,959
but in the newent oh it stinks and I

239
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,399
went like oh this you know something's

240
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,200
got to give right and and it did Connie

241
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,519
Welsh was a teacher and the way that

242
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,040
they taught acting there to people like

243
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,600
uh uh Dan travante and uh Joan vanar

244
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,920
whom I I all got to work with and a

245
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,040
bunch of other right before Merill

246
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
Streep showed up by the way uh but there

247
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,279
were a lot of oh and John gu was in the

248
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,000
school that's how I got to do Musa

249
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,040
that's another story that the mar

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,600
perform I mean it was great talent great

251
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,440
wonderful people but uh Connie Welsh

252
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,560
would would get these these kids from

253
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,000
the Midwest uh like etop pin's daughter

254
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,240
who was also there at the time and would

255
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,079
basically strip them down now I don't

256
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,680
want you to think about about ETO pin's

257
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,440
daughter being stripped down because she

258
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,040
was a big girl and it wouldn't it would

259
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,760
not be it's not a good image to start

260
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,079
this discussion with but anyway she

261
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,600
would basically uh try to reduce

262
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,760
everything to a technique that would be

263
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,079
taught to all vocal technique physical

264
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,920
technique you know uh uh acting

265
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,440
technique and it was all technique

266
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,360
technique technique and and the way that

267
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,279
our generation what our generation

268
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,920
brought to it was you know [ __ ]

269
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,200
technique you know it's me you know here

270
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,839
I am I'm going to do my thing I'm

271
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,040
naturally talented I want to learn you I

272
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,839
want to experience as much as I can

273
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,000
learn from others and do it and do it

274
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,600
and do it and so and that's what

275
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,880
happened right afterwards that that

276
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,200
whole older way of working went went

277
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,519
away but not to say I didn't she had

278
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,639
some wonderful exercises and and I

279
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,560
learned a lot you know from from her and

280
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,959
from the class uh but it was still a

281
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,560
very oldfashioned way of approaching the

282
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,440
the theater and it didn't it had very

283
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,360
little to do with personality with what

284
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,560
you brought to the table they they kind

285
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,160
of frowned upon that uh when I went to

286
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,440
Dennis and some summer theater during my

287
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,360
years at Yale and spent a summer in rep

288
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,920
there with people like John shuck and uh

289
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,079
and visiting actors stars coming in to

290
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,079
play with us we did a rep a reparatory

291
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,560
season so You' do a you'd be doing a

292
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,839
play learn a play doing a musical and

293
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,959
learning another Musical and it was

294
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,279
great training at the end of that John

295
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,639
John Davidson was there also who became

296
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,600
a great pop star he a very handsome

297
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,839
young man with a great voice was before

298
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,920
he went on that's incredible he

299
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,839
ter there's a new show now on the on the

300
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,800
uh uh the Food Channel called that's

301
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
inedible have you seen that yet all

302
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,920
right anyways believable it's also

303
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:47,399
unwatchable but but I digest all

304
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,199
right uh so I at that time uh working

305
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,959
with all these these people uh it felt

306
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,199
like a little microcosm of what the the

307
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,360
real world was and uh uh and I worked

308
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,839
with Peter Bergman on two musicals that

309
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,199
Aus Pendleton wrote Tom Jones where I

310
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,360
played the lead character and Tom Tom

311
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,800
Jones The Musical Tom Jones The Musical

312
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,720
was they're allowed speaking directly

313
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,920
out before the movie wow really wow and

314
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,519
it was brilliant it was wonderful I bet

315
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,639
it was just like Hamilton like yes it

316
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,199
was it was like Hamilton except there

317
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,440
probably weren't any U uh uh well anyway

318
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:25,959
it was it was true to the story of Tom

319
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,560
Jones but it was like Hamilton and and

320
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:32,199
it was directed by Bill Francisco

321
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,800
brilliant director a and uh and a great

322
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,160
experience big big hit and then it was

323
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,680
followed up by Booth is back in town

324
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,199
which is a musical about the booth

325
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,680
family that Austin Pendleton wrote and

326
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,680
Bergman wrote the lyrics for both yeah

327
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,199

these are the days this isn't the days

550
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,760
by the way of real smog I feel like we

552
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,799
[ __ ] stuff yes they say in the 70s it

553
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,000
was the worst in Los Angeles right and

554
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,880
that's when I was I was in the late in

555
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,400
the mid 60s so it was it was bad but

556
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,320
anyway uh I took driving lessons I

557
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,039
learned how to drive and and uh and I

558
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,799
got an apartment up on Beachwood Drive

559
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,679
overlooking the entire city and I could

560
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,919
see the sea and I was settling in for a

561
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,440
great run and oh boy I'm a California

562
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,360
boy now in Los Angeles and I think I I

563
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,120
may have even done some television shows

564
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,320
or something and uh no I didn't I hadn't

565
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,320
done TV shows at that time and and the

566
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,840
phone rings and it's my agent and I had

567
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,760

500 people who'd read for my role they

571
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:47,880
were stupid enough to cast me and it's

572
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,399
it's a wonderful musical based on the uh

573
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,039

764
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:54,039
yeah and my second grade teacher Mrs

765
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,720
Green was a very good friend of Helen

766
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,320
Hayes who was at that time you have to

767
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,840
explain who Helen Hayes was

768
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,799
she was like the the the the diva of

769
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,799
theater you know and Helen Hayes was

770
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:09,639
doing a show called uh Mrs mcing on

771
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,359
Broadway and Brandon dldo was playing

772
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,119
the little boy in that and she because

773
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,599
she knew I was a really good actor uh

774
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,879
Helen Hayes asked that I audition for

775
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,480
Brandon's understudy I would have

776
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,720
replaced him and I was believe it or not

777
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,760
shy at the time I didn't take that

778
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,879
opportunity so here well what 20 years

779
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,879
later I'm under studying Brandon dlda

780
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:36,399
and we became extremely close friends uh

781
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:41,079
one of the reasons that we did was he

782
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:45,599
was a a Viper he was a a wonderful uh

783
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:48,000
dedicated pothead and he and and so we

784
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,440
would we'd go up in in the Henry Miller

785
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,280
Theater I think where we were working

786
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,200
after rehearsal and and later after the

787
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,879
shows we'd hang around and we go up to a

788
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,560
dressing room an unused dressing room at

789
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,480
the top of the a staircase and we'd get

790
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,839
stoned and we turn on the air

791
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,400
conditioner so you know get the stuff

792
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:08,000
out so it wouldn't and at the end of the

793
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,160
run I remember looking over at the air

794
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,040
conditioner and realizing that the air

795
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,320
conditioner was actually not in a window

796
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,040
it was on a window sill so what it was

797
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,400
doing was just recycling you know no

798
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,320
wonder we got so high up there you know

799
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,480
but but but then Brandon and I stayed

800
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,760
friends and he was teaching himself to

801
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,440
play guitar uh because he wanted to

802
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,880
change his career and so I I hung out

803
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,480
with all these great musicians uh and

804
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,160
and uh especially the international

805
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,079
submarine band Graham Parsons we used to

806
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,880
go down and hear him play all the time

807
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,760
and we jam and it was it was it was

808
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,359
groovy man and and we' put hash and

809
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,480
cigarettes so we could smoke them in

810
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,680
public and all that and we took acid

811
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,319
together and Brandon had a beautiful uh

812
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,359
uh home up in Vermont we go up there and

813
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:02,040
we get Get Stoned on acid and walk

814
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,040
around talk to the deer and you know and

815
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:08,400
he was married to the sister of one of

816
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,560
my classmates from Yale okay I see how

817
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,800
this is going to tie together fire sign

818
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,720
that sister gave a hand job to David

819
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,720
Osman no is this not right

820
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,160
sorry totally logical I'll put it in the

821
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:28,359
footnotes or the hand notes if you will

822
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,280
so anyway uh Brandon towi at one point

823
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:33,800
Brandon says after the show closed he

824
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,400
says I want to go back out to to LA and

825
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,800

where he got the title I said son of a

918
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,480
[ __ ] all this time I didn't know

919
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,160
amazing uh so anyway we're hanging out

920
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,319
and he wants to do some research on the

921
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,720
youth Revolution here we going around to

922
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,400
the youth Revolution and so we went down

923
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,319
to the Sunset Strip uh during a

924
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,960
demonstration against the curfew that

925
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,760
the city wanted to impose on young

926
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,480
people on the strip

927
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,640
and that became the Sunset Strip riots

928
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,560
holy [ __ ] and it became the Sunset Strip

929
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,319
riots because the LA Police cordoned off

930
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,079
one end of the Sunset Strip and the

931
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,240
sheriff's department cordoned off the

932
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,599
others and they just did a pincer

933
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,760
squeeze and pushed everybody into the

934
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,400
middle So that obviously there was going

935
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:27,400
to be unrest you know and and then they

936
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,920

00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:02,720
we're on to something uh the art of

1081
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,480
sendup because see Bergman he he had the

1082
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:10,160
Gift of Gab but he also had an ability

1083
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,599
to uh AB absorb and become the

1084
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,720
characters that he was interviewing so

1085
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:19,760
like if he interviewed a shaman a Hy

1086
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:23,200
Shaman uh a after the guy was gone he

1087
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,640
could he would then become the Hy shaman

1088
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,920
on the radio and could talk to people

1089
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,280
and tell them things and read read tarot

1090
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,319
cards and all this so he I saw that he

1091
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,960
just absorbed these things and instead

1092
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,880
of saying like the shaman told me he

1093
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,000
would say he would become the shaman and

1094
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,880
and be the shaman and I would shame on

1095
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,040
you Bergman you know uh and and so he

1096
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,880
had this enormous following uh he

1097
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,359
created a thing called the

1098
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,720
lovein uh which was held in allean park

1099
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:55,920
I played a Russian poet called Yuri gnov

1100
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:59,119
which means Yuri [ __ ] because gavno is

1101
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,839
[ __ ] shitty Yori shitty George or

1102
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:05,040
something and uh and I read a poem in

1103
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:07,280
Russian you know one of my Russian poems

1104
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,440
translated you know to the crowd of

1105
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,200
thousands of thousands of people who all

1106
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,319
were fans of Peter bergman's radio foras

1107
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,520
and came to this first lovein he created

1108
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:20,599
the name and everything and and and so

1109
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:25,720
we had this phenomenon going

1110
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:29,880
on and uh and we created an

1111
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,559
improv oh yeah we we were asked to uh we

1112
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,480
kind of created a name for ourselves as

1113
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:38,240
the fire the Oz fire sign theater okay

1114
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,799
and so we were asked to perform in the

1115
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,559
student lounge at UCLA and we said

1116
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:46,760
perform what are we going to do so we

1117
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:50,359
created uh we we we put on it's all the

1118
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:53,839
art of put on we became an expatriate

1119
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:58,000
Eastern European comedy troop theater

1120
00:49:53,839 --> 00:50:00,960
theater troop and we were trying to stay

1121
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,040
in in in America because we had escaped

1122
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,240
from

1123
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:07,079
communism and and we had we had a play

1124
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,880
that was a big success over there called

1125
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,160
waiting for the electrician or someone

1126
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,480
like him but because we didn't speak

1127
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:18,480
English we had to do it kind of like as

1128
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:20,160
a MIM so we did some crazy improv there

1129
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,680
of waiting for the electrician all right

1130
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:28,160

Village that we shot a lot of the stuff

1155
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,680

Park and in Central Park and that's

1157
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,319

script you know I believe in

1179
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:31,480

1181
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,559

but when I'm in the subway as I tell her

1219
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,040
when I get back to the Seance I was

1220
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:14,400
trying to get some lettuce out of my

1221
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,920
teeth in one of the the bubble in one of

1222
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,680
the gum machines there had little

1223
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:24,160
mirrors on them and some guy stole the

1224
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,680
suitcase Puerto Rican guy stole the

1225
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:30,520
suitcase now apparently this really

1226
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:32,359
happened to somebody oh yeah okay so I

1227
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,440

00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:37,040
all upset and she says that's okay all

1229
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,480
right so in the

1230
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,319
movie Henry's debating now how are we

1231
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:45,720
going to do that should we have a

1232
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:48,520
stuffed a fake dog uh should we have a

1233
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,520
maybe just a fur coat with ice on it uh

1234
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,520
or should we have a real dog very

1235
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,799
well-trained patient real dog it's more

1236
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,040
to it than that he gets a real dog and

1237
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,760
he thinks it's funny if it's a St

1238
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,000
Bernard so this beautiful big St Bernard

1239
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,079
is on on the set in the apartment and

1240
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,960
they tranquilize it and they put it in

1241
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,680
the bathtub and he got his his tongue

1242
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,359
coming out and he's snoring and they put

1243
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:18,359
the fake ice on it and it's a real one

1244
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,440
shot we open the door you know POV of

1245
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:23,240

1246
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,480
bathroom and oh my God I see the thing

stammer whatever ever and and cut and so

1249
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,280
then they give the dog the

1250
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:37,520
antidote the dog

1251
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,280

the whole plot line wow and they

1260
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:11,160
replaced it with a magic box this made

1261
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,039
the film even more impenetrable than it

1262
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:16,160
was

1263
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:19,640
already a magic box that Orson Wells

00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,559
last train to gdau or something I can't

1286
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,440
remember the title right now but but it

1287
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,960
had a real long run it's going to be his

1288
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:28,520
next movie and it's the story of of

1289
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:31,520

uh it's it's a wonderful I I don't want

1293
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,520
to get into the whole play because it's

1294
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,319
it's quite a complicated but fascinating

1295
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:48,160
real story anyway uh we're now at the

1296
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:51,440
point where I'm wrapping the

1297
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,160
movie and there's something else that

1298
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:58,000

1300
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,839
closing down my apartment in New York

1301
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:06,359

the concept of waiting for electrician

1557
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,360

1558
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:35,760
approached by a producer named Gary
