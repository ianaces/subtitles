chain smok and [ __ ]

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,559
it's down to three cats now with one

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,520
kind of teetering on the fence they just

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,759
sit there in her apartment and the

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,240
secondhand smoke she won't even let them

26
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,000
outside have a decent chance of chucking

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,720
themselves under a bus Tire to [ __ ]

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,320
end it all right they know they it's too

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,680
dangerous on the street they keep the

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,680
cats in so they say breathe a secondhand

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,960
smoke and then it turns into third hand

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
smoke fourth hand smoke that's the cats

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,119

even furry cuz they're they're all

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,200
greasy with nicotine like old curtains

37
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,680

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,759

hateful and she's suicidal I mean in a

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,360
logical sense like it's not a desperate

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
about did you ever eat a Subway

70
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,440
breakfast sandwich

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,159
it's a damn good sandwich is it CU it

72
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,319
comes on the same bun it's the regular

73
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,920
deli style bun that all the other

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,799
sandwiches every fast food place has to

75
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,319
put their breakfast sandwiches on

76
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:19,159
something crazy it's on a mixed pancake

77
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:21,159
or you know it's a Lecky Quant or wacky

78
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,840
biscuit but the someway you can put it

79
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,120
on a regular bun and it comes you can

80
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,920
put vegetables on it so it gives you the

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,040
illusion that it's good for you and I

82
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,720
love the placebo effect I'm a sucker for

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,640
it but you can't get it after

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,319
11:00 I can sleep till 1: or 9 at night

85
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,480
depending on what narcotics are still

86
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,439
floating around in my system

87
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,640
right but I still try to get the

88
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,799
breakfast sandwich and I'll go in hey

89
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,000

100
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,880
don't want to give them

101
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,759
[ __ ] the entire breakfast menu at Subway

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,040
consists of nothing but the egg it's all

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,400
the same sandwiches they serve all day

104
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,120
long plus an egg you you don't have to

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,000
fire up the griddle for the flap Jacks

106
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,680
and

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
it's not a process like other

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,600
restaurants who really do have to stop

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,360
at 11: because they have a real [ __ ]

110
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,600
menu but you don't you're just stealing

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,880
sense and I don't want to be a dick to

113
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,199
