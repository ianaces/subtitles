00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,400
now I know I'm looking out across this

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,639
audience right now and I see a lot of

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,519
people who have been hardened by the

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,000
ravages of time I've seen people whove

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,520
you know watched children and parents

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,119
slaughtered and that makes me sad

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,519
because I just look across this pasty

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,800
crew of Misfits we have here and

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,599

children abandoned in war torn

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,520
impoverished third world countries these

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,199
children are given a new chance at life

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,160
in the home of a loving family but even

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,160
still it doesn't always work

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,320
out basically we always just wanted a a

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,359

testicle yeah so we figured the most

29
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,479
important thing that we could do and the

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,799
best thing that we could do is adopt one

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,799
of those adorable starving children from

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,960

barbaric leader of a third world country

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,799
which he ruled with an iron fist through

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,360
a mind-boggling snafu of bureaucratic

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,840
red tape instead of a needy third world

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,840
orphan Greg and Linda had inadvertently

he's truly our little

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,599
miracle you know he is a very big kid

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,560
bigger than most of the kids plus being

70
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,000
the only kid on the playground with a

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,959
mustache I think that's sort of hard for

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
him to deal with

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,200
sometimes but you know what we have to

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,200
be firm in our parenting just the other

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,000
day we had to give LF very serious

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,840
timeout he tried to cut the cat's paw

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,239
off because he thought the cat fluffers

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,159
tried to steal one of his shoes he put

79
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,959
the cat in a a re-education

80
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:41,000
camp seems

81
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,120
crazy I can't teach that cat a thing the

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,879
future remains uncertain for Greg and

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,239

commandante but with a little patience

86
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,959
and a lot of misplaced hope this Modern

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Family just might

88
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,720
work just because he has killed and
