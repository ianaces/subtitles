Minnesota my car died it's always a

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,280

1993 Ford

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,240
Escort it's a stupid name for that

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,399
car cuz really when they're that old and

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,399
beat up you usually just call them

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:43,239
hookers not ask escorts are very

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,039
expensive $300 a night I wouldn't even

17
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,680
kick in the extra $17 for the high mile

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,559
synthetic oil change that is not an ESC

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,100
that's a Ford hooker or a a [ __ ] it was

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,960
a it was a Ford

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,719
[Laughter]

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,920
[ __ ] four-door Ford [ __ ] try saying

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,320
that three times fast

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,799
fun goddamn thing was totaled which of

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,600
course means the cost to repair of the

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,040
vehicle is greater than the total value

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,040
of the vehicle and what happened was the

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,280
front right tire was a little low low on

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,360
air I pulled in one of these gas

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,640
stations you got to pay $150 to use the

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,240
air compressor [ __ ] total man it's

32
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,759
just

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,119
total so I had to go looking for a new

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,880
car that reminded me I'm not cool

35
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,119
anymore if I ever was 40 years years old

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,520
wife two kids mortgage payment not

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,399
looking at the same kind of car you're

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,240
looking at 20 years ago are you like

39
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,159
I've been looking at the Ford Flex got a

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,399
new model called the Ford if you haven't

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,759
seen them what they do is they take all

42
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,040
the boxiness of a station

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,200
wagon and combine it with all the

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,640
sexlessness of a

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,159
minivan they combine those two things

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,079
together into one model and they send

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,159
you out on the highways and

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,680
byways and I've been seeing a lot of

49
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,520
these cars on the road and I got to

50
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,759
admit I think they look pretty

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,440
sharp and I think they look cool for the

52
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,440
wrong raises they're like wow what is

00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,799
and she says to me well I didn't know

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,000

silence

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,480
too so I asked her to repeat herself

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,519
hoping I had misheard her and she

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,360

84
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,239

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,280
and I took her to a rock and roll show

100
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,799

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,199
show and I knew for sure it was it was

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,039
too many mushrooms cuz while we were

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,520
waiting in line outside the club for the

109
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,919
show to start my wife passed out because

110
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,960
she thought she

111
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:44,680
saw a physical ray of light form on the

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,240
face of the Setting Sun hurdle through

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,639
space to smack her in the forehead and

114
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,039
it laid her out I'm not lying it was

115
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:58,080
pretty scary but when she came to the

116
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:01,639
first words out of her mouth was what

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,639
time do a [ __ ] con

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,680
start I didn't know there was an

119
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,479
Applebees over there do you see the

120
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,720
difference do you see what I'm talking

121
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,600
about early in our marriage we lived in

122
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,320
Vancouver British Columbia a beautiful

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,320
part of the planet and if you know

124
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,560
anything about British Columbia you know

125
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,560
they have the uh finest marijuana

126
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,680
available in North America and I

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
remember one particular time my wife and

128
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,280
I had to take our car across the US

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,199
Canadian border and what this woman did

130
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,680
this rock star of a life partner is she

131
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,160
stuffed her little

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,960
um her coin purse her Joey pouch I it's

133
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,680
my wife I don't want to get gross about

134
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,960
it she stuffed it filled to bursting

135
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,000
with British Columbia's finest marijuana

136
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,000
just so that we had enough smoke for our

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,680
road trip down the California coast

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,680
that's a

139
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,400
woman that's someone to build a life

140
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,800
around

141
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,240
I didn't know there was an Applebees

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,840
over there I don't know who that is I

143
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,160
don't know what to do with

144
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,120
that plus I think it was a little mean

145
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,639
for her to say that kind of

146
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,919
mean-spirited you know like it's cruel

147
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,919
we're already in a Ford Flex pulling out

148
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,280
of a Dairy Queen after our kids'

149
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,759
swimming lessons I didn't know there was

150
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,800
an Applebees over there that's just

151
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,919
rubbing salt in the wound as far as I'm

152
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,080
concerned and that wound should not be

153
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,759
filled with salt ladies and gentlemen

154
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,120
it should be filled with British

155
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,560
Columbia's finest marijuana

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,560
cuz that's how Papa likes to get down
