1
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,600
it's nice to to be in America um because

2
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,360
you have like far more liberal freedom

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,440
of speech laws uh so I can I can I can

4
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,760
tell the jokes here which at home make

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,760
you know qualify as like hate speech

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,760
um so have a good night you

7
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:56,960
know yeah now I recently joined uh

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:00,359
Montreal's Gates trade Alliance um we go

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,160
around the city beating up the bisexuals

10
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,160
you know

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,759
um I don't know I think it's okay to

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,840
tell these jokes you know

13
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,360
uh how'd you get your

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,880
start uh very first set ever was a high

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,159
school project did 5 minutes at an

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,640
amateur night outside

17
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,119
Toronto and then the next set was I

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,479
think four years later was taking a year

19
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,759
off between undergrad and more school

20
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,040
and so I I went to a movie and in the

21
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,240
mall where the theater was located there

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,320
was also a comedy club advertising an

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,840
open mic and I had nothing to do I was

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,799
just writing jokes anyway for all this

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,159
time and uh yeah I used to go watch

26
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,799
standup when I went on vacation or

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,520
something to New York or San Francisco

28
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,119
or wherever or LA but it wasn't

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,000
something that I did at home or took in

30
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,960
at home it was more just uh garbage pale

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,479
kids money python things like this but

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,680
it wasn't stand-up comedy really what do

33
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,360
you find funny what do I find

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,879
funny uh I suppose I find funny

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,239
When people's expectations are not met

36
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,280
it's a weird thing going around for

37
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
standup quite a bit because uh every

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,920
place you go you have to determine like

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
their like values and lines and mores

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,120
and things like this and I don't know if

41
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,440
anyone's ever been to Portland

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,800
um [ __ ] Portland yeah

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,560
my it's like this like this hyper hyper

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,040
hyper hyper hyper hyper liberal little

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,280
enclave and so profoundly conservative

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,159
in its own way and before the first time

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,040
I ever got to do a show there I was told

48
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:47,680
by the person putting on the show said

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,680
you should know uh that this is a safe

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:59,760
space I was like yeah

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,760
like that's my assumption you know

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,879
like like as an animal you know

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,080
like I only

54
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,680
go into those spaces

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,920
um which I understand to be

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,680
safe and then so I so I get there

57
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,440
and

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,920
it's

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,959
all lesbians and

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,760
me and I had

61
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:35,400
never felt so unsafe in my

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,599
life and I told them I was like look I

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,480
this is my first time in the Pacific

64
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:43,560
Northwest and I find myself asking

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,799
myself for the first time ever what do

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,959
lesbians want

67
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,239
um because the fact of the matter is I

68
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,400
continued I said I don't give a [ __ ] um

69
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,840
and it's not that I give any less of a

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,599
[ __ ] about your your particular

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,079
demographic than any other it's just

72
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,239
like where I come from what standup

73
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:07,000
comedy is it's like the most Artful way

74
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,400
of telling a room full of people to go

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,360
[ __ ]

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,680
themselves and so you want to play with

77
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,040
like people receive Notions and

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,280
stereotypes and things like this it's

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,519
like what is it about lesbians it's that

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,960
they have no sense of humor you know

81
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,560
um and when you're telling of a roomful

82
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,759
of lesbians that they have no sense of

83
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,960
humor and they're not laughing

84
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,400
um that that is the funniest [ __ ]

85
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,400
thing you

86
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,560
know like I know there are some there

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,840
are some who people who take issue you

88
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,320
know like with the word [ __ ] um but me I

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,360
I've only ever had problems with the

90
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,360
personality type you know um

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,479
here's the

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:10,759
album stuff in there here anyway so this

93
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,240
is an album and uh recorded in Montreal

94
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,320
what's it called it was okay okay the

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,680
full name the full name is it was okay

96
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,680
an album of comedy by David Hy why'd you

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,840
pick that title why why why is that the

98
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,520
title it encapsulates so much I think I

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,280
don't think there's one there's one to

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,479
say it's it's this or this alone I think

101
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,639
would spoil what it what what it is so

102
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,600
just to document it friend of mine David

103
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,000
gston said you know he's a

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
cinematographer he said he can shoot it

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,360
and it never occurred to me so on New

106
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,560
Year's Day Grumpy's Bar was shut down

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,720
for two hours and we just filled it with

108
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,000
like you know people who enjoy comedy

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
and just did the recording and that's it

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and it was a you know nice way to start

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,600
off the year a lot of hungover friends

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,360
taking it a comedy show what's the sign

113
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,080
of a good show for you sign of a good

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,639
show

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,919
uh people will say that they were

116
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,919
laughing at things that they didn't know

117
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,160
they could laugh at perhaps or they're

118
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,280
laughing at things they didn't want to

119
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,639
laugh at or or or uh it made them

120
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,400
think are you offended by the hobo

121
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,240
comparison that's being made no I don't

122
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm not offended by this I think that

123
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,960
it's there's a there's a truth to it I

124
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,639
think that not that it's easy not that

125
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,319
it's easy but if it's said over and over

126
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,479
it's kind you know no it's fine I'm not

127
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,720
aan by that at all oh there's a train

128
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,720
over

129
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,319
there oh

130
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,000
yeah you know it's a maybe it's like

131
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,260
like a Grain Train maybe it's not a hobo
