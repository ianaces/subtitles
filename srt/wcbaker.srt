1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,600
she married into a really conservative

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,480
family my sister really really

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,599
conservative which made me nervous for

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,280
the wedding and the like close- in-laws

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,240
seemed great but like I think it was

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,320
like an uncle-in-law or something um

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
that I heard talking to another one and

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,560
and he

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,279
said I don't know how I feel about this

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,760
gay marriage thing if we let a woman

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,359
marry a

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,679
woman what's to stop a man from marrying

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,679
his Pig

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,810
[Music]

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,810
[Laughter]

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,079
I don't know why he's so terrified that

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,160
pig [ __ ] are going to inundate local

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,680
legislature with marriage certificate

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,000
request I don't picture Pig [ __ ] the

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
settling down type kind of think it's

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,120
the

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,519
point [ __ ] a pig is the lack of Comm

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,160
I don't want to be swine exclusive

24
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,960
though when it comes to any inner

25
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,199
species intercourse I don't think the

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,199
future is on your mind you

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,680
know think you're dreaming of a nice

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,640
house with a big backyard and a picket

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
fence so your wife can run around but

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,840
not

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,759
away my goat husband left me oh did you

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,759

34
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,980
[Laughter]

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,880
it came at a really interesting time my

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,119
sister's wedding

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,399
and because there was this case before

38
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,880
The Supreme Court uh it was called

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,560
Masterpiece Cake Shop versus the state

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,439
of

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,240
Colorado and if you don't know what it

42
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,600
is uh essentially these two dudes were

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,240
getting married and they wanted to get a

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,840
cake and they went into masterpiece cake

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,520
shop and the guy who ran that was like

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,520
no no gay cakes here I don't like gay

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,520
things

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,320
you named your cake shop Masterpiece

49
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,320
calm

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,200
down and they wanted to get a cake and

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,560
he was like no I'm not going to do it

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,120
because making a cake is my art and I

53
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,360
don't want my art to serve something I

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,360
don't

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,000
support which I am in full support of

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,840
the culinary arts I think they're

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,599
wonderful and fantastic but the last

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,239
wedding you went to who made the

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,800
cake yeah you don't you don't know you

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,040
know the only person who really cares

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,640
about a cake at a wedding is your

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
diabetic Aunt Debbie who's like is it

63
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:50,319

64
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,319
moist no my Apple's great is it moist

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,040
how it also kind of like his argument

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,159
presupposes that every gay wedding is

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,159
just themed gay

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,920
which is not true gay weddings have a

69
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,920
bunch of themes there's Wizard of

70
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,280

my exes but I would never do that I

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,400
would never really name someone and then

85
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,920
talk about them on stage so Amanda
