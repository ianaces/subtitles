okay and um you know you know that that

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,879
that wasn't a whole lot like it wasn't

76
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,879
interesting to me the only things that

77
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,959
were at the very time was when the three

78
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,599
St just made a kid's record that's

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,120
awesome you know and I would like I

80
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,760
don't care about Captain Hook you know

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
but I quit going a church when I

82
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,799
discovered the three stoes and I found

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,840
my Saints

84
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,440
so uh I really did

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,879
yeah how quickly did you did you pick it

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,480
up from listening to was that the first

87
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,760
thing you remember then like the three

88
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,480
St we can start there cuz well it was

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,159
was stuck in my head they used to show

90
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:41,720
it every day before I went to school

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:47,439
okay um I was um I was already I think I

92
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:49,200
had just started school in the maybe

93
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,000
1961

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,840
mhm yeah and uh you know so there was

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,560
only 2 and a half channels on television

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
they only went till about 11:00 at night

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,159
right and then they would play this

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,360
little

99
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:06,120
film um at the end of the broadcast

100
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,360
night and it was showing all the

101
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,439
combined powers of the Armed Forces and

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,799
everything and there was a poem that a

103
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,680
guy was narrating about how you know I I

104
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,680
have done this and I have done that you

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,199
know in other words I am man yeah yeah

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,560
yeah you know we've uh done this and

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,360
we've done that and he was a I guess he

108
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,759
was a fighter pilot or something like

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,479
that or maybe an airplane pilot even but

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,600
he talked about how he had reached the

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,039
skies and broken barriers and finally

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,720
touch the face of God and that line used

113
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,560
to just like send shock waves through me

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
I bet yeah no I mean just to hear that

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,680
turn of a phrase I I I guess I always

116
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,440
had some sort of Love of language MH in

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,080
me and um yeah you know and then they

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,840
would be off they'd be gone so Not only

119
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,360
was there no television like in the

120
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,400
middle of the night or anything like

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,639
that or would just go off at 11:

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,960
um there was no way you could

123
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,960
capture those things there was no way

124
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,080
you could preserve anything that you

125
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,600
just saw sure in other words there was

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,360
no video recording there was no nothing

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,080
you know it was like you lived with this

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,759
anxiety day and night if you were a

129
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,759
little freak like me that you just saw

130
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,199
the coolest thing you were you were ever

131
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,039
going to see in your life and you'll

132
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,720
never get it back and I may never ever

133
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,120
ever see it again because there was no

134
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,120
way to know yeah so and so the

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,919
desperation that a lot of artists had

136
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,000
was to just cling to it psychically

137
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,639
while during its uh airing and try and

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,080
suck every element out of it that you

139
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,000
could including the music yeah you know

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,919
and I was a little musician um you I

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,560
played trumpet when I was like nine mhm

142
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,319
something like that but even before that

143
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,120
I would just see all these cool things

144
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,080
and and in 5 minutes it's going to be

145
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,000
gone it was like yeah it was like when

146
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,160
you're done your last bite of uh you

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,599
know sea salt and caramel sure sure sure

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,479
you know and it's like GE you know I

149
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,960
don't know do I really polish it off and

150
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,840
then it's like I got to call it a day

151
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,520
it's gone it's over absolutely so um

152
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,880
unless you're a glutton and you decide

153
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,520
to of course you know go grab five more

154
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
pints right which an ex addict would go

155
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,479
do sure sure sure but that's a whole

156
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,720
another story um but uh what would

157
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,080
happen was clinging to those things the

158
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,319
only available stuff was like that was

159
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,960
recorded comedy mhm and that was it I

160
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,960
mean I don't mean I mean recorded

161
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,919
anything music uh we had uh I had heard

162
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,720
esel mhm I had heard what they now call

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,280
Space Age bachelor pad music uh but back

164
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,360
then it was just this exotic stuff that

165
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,800
like if a guy wanted to get into the uh

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,919
you know with his wife get in the mood

167
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,440
with a couple of cocktails and you know

168
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,080
before the tie came off they would

169
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,560
listen to Exotica right right you know

170
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,919
and then they go bump

171
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,440
uglies in the dark in the ' 50s cuz you

172
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,720
couldn't call it what it really was of

173
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,360
course but it set the mood in other

174
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,440
words on that note I'm going to just

175
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,199

but you know these guys just were

201
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,720
thinking out of the box at the time and

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
they were wondering what doesn't exist I

203
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
mean people people go see a movie and

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,680

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
soundtrack if it's an exotic movie of

206
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,800
some type and all the pallets that

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,800
underscore Bliss and escape and U sex

208
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,639
you know sure sure yeah but uh but one

209
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,960
of the

210
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,039
records that I somehow had access to in

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,279
19

212
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:36,120
62 was Jonathan Winters uh another day

213
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,919
another planet M now I was enthralled

214
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,680
captivated with Jonathan winter but

215
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,200
before him I was exposed to Sid Caesar

216
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,760
yes when I lived in Detroit it was the

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,839
50s and my mom let me stay up till like

218
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,160
8 or nine mhm yeah and um I remember

219
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,440
sitting on the couch in the projects in

220
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Detroit old giant mons TV black and

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,279
white and watching this this crazy man

222
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,720
you know it's the first televised image

223
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,399
I think I ever saw yeah and there was

224
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,839
here there's this crazy man that's like

225
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,000
pulling Hells and Heavens out of his

226
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,680
rear end and he's like vocalizing and

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,440
making noises and and also doing silent

228
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,920
stuff too and doing silent movie mimicry

229
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,200
sure um which was brilliant I mean

230
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,320
everything he could speak languages that

231
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,480
you would swear were real langu exactly

232
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,040
right yeah and I was I just was an

233
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,959
instant student of this guy yeah Sid

234
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Caesar he would do m movie parodies

235
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,640
television show parodies and it was like

236
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,880
everything that I wound up to do MH just

237
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,279
about all of it it wrapped up in this

238
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,880
guy who molecularly just shook me when I

239
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,800
first saw him and I think that's one of

240
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,680
the reasons why like Sid Caesar was so

241
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,040
important especially at that time and

242
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,920
the world of Comedy I mean one it was

243
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,480
Live Comedy tevision from New York I

244
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
mean like this was the real deal and I

245
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,680
think the original show was an hour and

246
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,560
a half long they originally gave him an

247
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,839
hour and a half that's what he asked for

248
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,800
right you know when it was Caesar's hour

249
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,760
before it came your show of shows and I

250
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,279
mean like the the writing team that he

251
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,680
had also would speak of Sid Caesar as if

252
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,480
he was I mean he was this this thing you

253
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,399
know like was a God he was he was this

254
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,079
troubled God as most of our mirth makers

255
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,360
are unfortunately yeah and Jonathan

256
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,720
wners was also a very troubled God but

257
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,519
if you want to boil it down these two

258
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,600
guys were my heroes since Caesar didn't

259
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,320
make albums sure but but I was exposed

260
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,839
to him first yeah and I used to think to

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,320
myself what a crazy man what what kind

262
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:41,200
of man does these things and why does he

263
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,360
appear so iconic and heroic like right

264
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
out of the gate I suppose my suspension

265
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,240
of disbelief was a little different when

266
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,839
I was probably two or three or four you

267
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,839
know but I did see it and I remember

268
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,880
bits and and one of the things that

269
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:59,639
struck me about him like like people

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,200
wacky was invented by people who ain't

271
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,200
funny yeah you know what I mean like

272
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,880
remember those NBC promos where all the

273
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,519
cast of the different shows were doing

274
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,360
the wacky dance thing you know whatever

275
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,000
it

276
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,480
isv CAU me right you caught me unawares

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,279
even though I'm completely in makeup and

278
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,800
on a set oh me and they're doing this

279
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,639
impromptu wacky dance and uh and it used

280
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,920
to turn my stomach because you know that

281
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,399
that was co-opted by some bloodless

282
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,000
Godless artless suit absolutely you know

283
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,600
what I mean dance in is funny right

284
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,120
dancing more dancing because dancing is

285
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,560
funny okay all right that's the truth

286
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,639
all right you know he's like uh the

287
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,079
gatekeeper and the Arbiter of what's

288
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,920
cool and what ain't yeah um so when I

289
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,600
saw that stuff I said this is just

290
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,880
nothing but wacky and then I began to

291
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,760
Muse on it and I said wacky was invented

292
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,920
by people who ain't funny yeah well

293
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,560
people that were truly funny now you now

294
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,160
most kids and most young people can't

295
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,600
tell the difference who's really funny

296
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,480
and who ain't who's cool musically and

297
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,760
who ain't who's a faker M you know but

298
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:14,440
they just um there's no I guess there's

299
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,800
no real um scrutiny going on yeah and

300
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,959
also it I think there is some scrutiny

301
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,839
unfortunately it's like the opinions

302
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,600
that matter are just as loud as those

303
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,959
idiots who said do the wacky dance no

304
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,320
with more arms cuz arms is wacky that's

305
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,000
how my cousin did it at the party you

306
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,079
know that they do listen to people that

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,040
have you know a head on their shoulder

308
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,720
that go to the internet and say stuff

309
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,680
sometimes it can influence somebody to

310
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,560
back down sure yeah which I love oh it's

311
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,120
the best it doesn't happen enough I love

312
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,600
uh meanwhile there's all this other

313
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,279
crowd of people that you know it's like

314
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,639
anyone can play the home game mhm and

315
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,000
there are people that that are so

316
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,040
malevolent that they post with a

317
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,920
vehement you know and I'm sitting there

318
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,199
thinking about this this guy's always on

my website or he's always on somebody's

320
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,839
website and you look at the content and

321
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,959
it's usually you know it could be like

322
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,880
the Ladies sodality Home and Garden

323
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,480
website you know and some woman will be

324
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,800

there'll be another one it's like this

327
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,720
is also a good time to plant geraniums

328
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
but be conscious of putting out as many

329
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,320
Bee friendly plants as you can and then

330
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,880
the next post will be [ __ ]

331
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,680
you right it just escalates from 1 to

332
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,199
100 yeah and you know and you know the

333
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,639
stupid kid is like 13 or something yeah

334
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:38,720
just going to reach in

335
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,639
and I'm here right I'm here to wipe your

336
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,360
face in the carpet you know yeah you

337
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,120
don't know me and there's nothing you

338
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,680
can do about it it's this cheesy cheap

339
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,480
little form of power it's not even it's

340
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,079
just yeah it's it's um I don't know it's

341
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,720
like the arguing equivalent of ringing

342
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,040
somebody's doorbell and running away

343
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,959
absolutely I know but you know what that

344
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,600
is that's like uh having the ambition to

345
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,519
be a rock in some shoe your whole life

346
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
what an ambition it's a false sense of

347
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,240
Anarchy it's like they really think they

348
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,160
might affect some change I know they

349
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,800
post with a vehement like there was an

350
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,440
award yeah to be given yeah you know

351
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,000
like they're really trying uh you know

352
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,800
and there's no there's no Hall of Fame

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,440
for a-hole posters you know I mean if

354
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,800
there is it's the Hall of nothing

355
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,800
because because what you say affects

356
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,360
nothing and nobody yeah yeah that would

357
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,759
have that place would have the worst

358
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,519
gift shop ever

359
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,000

they did exist yeah remember this one

361
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,240
fail that was good yeah that's five

362
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:49,680
bucks totally worth it yeah yeah epic

363
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,759
fail oh that's 12 bucks these guys

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,000
bought you by poster number seven you

365
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,399
know Bismark hat you and right and these

366
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,639
memes memes yeah I like them better when

367
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,519
they were called things that just sort

368
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,920
of stuck in your head Yeah just

369
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,600
something I thought of once and then go

370
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,600
away yeah yeah but I was going to say

371
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,040
that

372
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,880
um you know the the idea of what's funny

373
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,279
and what isn't it's it's it's like that

374
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,320
question should just be put out to

375
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:19,519
Pastor it's no longer uh it's no longer

376
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,199
debatable or you know because people

377
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,839
it's like

378
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:28,160
um comedy's really more subjective now

379
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,399
than it ever was before yeah um there's

380
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,759
you know so many it's like Basin Robbins

381
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,519
you know like how many flavors of Comedy

382
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,120
for sure you know and then some yeah but

383
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:42,720
that's okay by me but like when a past

384
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,959
fail system gets created it bugs me of

385
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,360
course yeah because it becomes the norm

386
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,360
like all these new cartoons that I

387
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,480
audition for they look like children's

388
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,240
refrigerator

389
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,079
art you know honestly and that's the

390
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,319
objective sure and it's supposed to be

391
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,839
about nothing right and it's not funny

392
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,920
but guess what if you create that as a

393
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,199
thing that everybody wonders about why

394
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,759
what is this why did they do um I I I

395
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,519
someone thinks they understand it and

396
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,120
then it becomes culty of course yeah so

397
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,920
um but the thing about that is um these

398
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,199
20s somethings have created a

399
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,240
substandard that is now the norm and the

400
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,120
reason they did it whether they knew it

401
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,240
or not I happen to know because I'm

402
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,120
about 80 years old but they did it so

403
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,920
that no one can fail sure nobody can

404
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,440
fail yeah it's like uh you know if no

405
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,759
one understands what it's about big deal

406
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,560
yeah if the drawing just looks like you

407
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,600
know I don't know yeah looks disturbing

408
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,600
Deeter Max threw up or

409
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,880
something or you know like or like a you

410
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,079
know like there was somebody you know

411
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,720
like my six-year-old trying to do a

412
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,839
Linda Barry cartoon you know right uh

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,759
yeah but she's really trying she she

414
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,040
doesn't want subst aing as high as she

415
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,360
can absolutely I'm talking about

416
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,920
somebody trying to like come up with a

417
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,639
quality and not even understand what

418
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,759
went into the original no they all want

419
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,160
to be Seth McFarland so you get like two

420
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,360
producer masterminds that that um decide

421
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,079
that they insist that they're going to

422
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,919
do their own anemic voices for the

423
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,799
characters right and they think they're

424
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,959

product with the accolades and and the

434
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,400

Rain when they're Des describing Lena

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,679
understanding where it comes from but I

488
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,880
mean but look at how they were raised

489
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,039
they were raised in like a generation

490
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,919
that where the media basically was

491
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:54,720
bombarding them with the message you're

492
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,360
a superstar or you're nothing mhm you

493
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,159
know what I mean lifestyles are rich and

494
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,360
famous all the sudden Don't You Wish You

495
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,080
Were Me

498
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,919
mean just it was almost like you never

499
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,240
you're not going to be anything and so

500
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,559
they just had this Superstar [ __ ] in

501
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,200
their head and it's like everybody was

502
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,840
proud of the job they had mhm if you had

503
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,159
a good job and you were supporting your

504
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,440
family it's like you didn't always have

505
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,600
one eye you know go down the marina and

506
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,880
you've got a nice kind of little speed

507
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,880
boat you know right wooden oldfashioned

508
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,480
with the glass wind you know and then

509
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,280
and then you start looking to the marina

510
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,840
left and right and there's these like

511
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,200
castles on wheels on on waves and uh and

512
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,000
you start feeling like nothing so

513
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,520
imagine growing up like that feeling

514
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,760
like you're nothing if you didn't have

515
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,400
everything right but but there is a way

516
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,080
to have everything it doesn't happen to

517
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,400
everybody but you got to work like crazy

518
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,720
otherwise you've got a a country full of

519
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,200
um Lottery dreamers mhm you know all I

520
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,760

I'll be famous and I'll be original yeah

522
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,960
and it goes to entertainment too it's

523
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,520
like I don't even have to have any

524
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,240
tangible skills like look at all the

525
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,200
people in reality television who make a

526
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,640
career out of being I mean less

527
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,679
interesting than people I know who

528
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,480
aren't in entertainment well number one

529
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,720
my heroes weren't effing celebrities

530
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,440
yeah they you know they just weren't My

531
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,480
Heroes were artists I no celebrity

532
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,480
worship if there was a particular man

533
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,200
that portrayed a part I believed in the

534
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,080
character sure I don't want to hear what

535
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,600
he has to say politically and all this

536
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,559
other crap He's Just Not That

537
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,559
interesting what he became as a

538
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,000
character was a concerted effort of guys

539
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,799
who wrote they were they had literary

540
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,159
backgrounds they didn't watch TV to

541
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,919
learn to write for TV mhm you know what

542
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:45,600
I mean yeah they they had literature

543
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,120
that they were students of and um you

544
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,720
know it just

545
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,240
uh I think well what I want to say is

546
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,799
there's people that if there are people

547
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,640
taking me seriously the other stuff you

548
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,320
don't have to take seriously but but I

549
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,440
wound up doing everything I dreamed

550
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,440
about out but I was willing to work for

551
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,240
it I have immigrant mentality you know

552
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,320
if I had the chance to work for 20 hours

553
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,120
a day I would do it to this day you know

554
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,000
it's just like that's all I know Ma Jour

555
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,000
as far as New

556
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:24,240
Frontiers I can't tell you too

557
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,440
much I tell you Jackie's fine and we're

558
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
all fine right here you know I was

559
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,159
thinking fny I don't know why Kennedy

560
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,080
came mind but but it's almost a Walder

561
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,760
Brenan if you think about it Walder

562
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,880
Brennan talks like this Dan down in the

563
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,799
belly and if you sort of change it a

564
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,039
little to KY and Frontiers going ahead

565
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:46,559
as far as the campaign goes I you know

566
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,559
it's pretty

567
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,679
close a lot of people don't want to put

568
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,000
that time and effort in but with me I

569
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,120
had no choice it was passion it was

570
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,520
Obsession I had OCD add no ADHD I was

571
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,480
just diagnosed with that yeah like at

572
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,880
the beginning of this year [ __ ] and I

573
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,320
was like I got

574
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,600
ADHD I've read Lots about it but the

575
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,520
thing is is you're the last one so my

576
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,600
friends were saying you paid somebody to

577
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,559
tell you that we could have told you we

578
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,240
could have told you and I'm going yeah I

579
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,320
know if I had like a buck for every

580
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,039
conversation I interrupted I'd be I'd

581
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,039
have a house in Bermuda you know that's

582
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,640
what I I teach and I actually made that

583
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,919
rule our last meeting I was like can we

584
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,640
all just please just speak without

585
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,039
anyone interrupting and then before the

586
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,320
next person could agree with me I

587
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,679
interrupted them and I was like well you

588
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,400
know like well at least I know where

589
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,640
we're starting so I'm not going to

590
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,080
follow my own rules see what I just did

591
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,720
there you know it's like they look

592
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,159
there's kids are born learning machines

593
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,679
you know they're sitting there going we

594
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,600
saw what you just did there is the worst

595
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,039
I mean and actually and that's how I

596
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,480
learned it's like that was it like I was

597
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,279
lucky enough to have somebody who who

598
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,840
exposed me to your show of shows Monty

599
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,480
Python's Flying Circus you know Warner

600
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,039
Brothers cartoons you know Faulty Towers

601
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,400
like all that stuff when I was little

602
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,559
and when you see that when you're in

603
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,640
that impressionable age there's no

604
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,520
substituting it with crap right there's

605
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,279
no going back to crap you have there is

606
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,320
you have to maintain that level and then

607
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:21,360
you start finding these bizarre things

608
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,320
the fire sign theater when I was 12 you

609
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,159
know things like that um that wasn't

610
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,279
exactly my cup of tea because that came

611
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,720
when I graduated after I graduated high

612
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,760
school but but I mean the stuff that we

613
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,080
were talking about like Sid Caesar and

614
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,720
Jonathan wyers Danny K yeah right these

615
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,840
phenomenal The Comedians like Jack

616
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,279
Carter so underrated he was a Dynamo he

617
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,919
was like a Robin Williams right I mean

618
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,799
seriously and of course Jonathan wyers

619
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,600
was the Prototype yeah you know Robin

620
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,880
Williams MH um he was inspired by the

621
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,640
same pretty much the same stuff as I was

622
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,600
sure everything was Jonathan winners if

623
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,799
you if you can see a man on like prime

624
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,159
time television on like the Jack py show

625
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,520
having a conversation with his

626
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:09,000
shoe you know I was like that's for me

627
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,559
yeah that's this is like sent right to

628
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,279
me as a gift yeah that's the way I used

629
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:15,640
to look at it how did you get a hold of

630
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,120
this album first was it in the family or

631
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,760
you know what it is you had to find

632
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,120
things just like hey you know in

633
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:27,360

idea of another day day another planet I

636

mean I loved futuristic stuff I liked uh

637
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,120
this thing that made me laugh comedy

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,760
when it was called comedy sure I mean I

639
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,320
think something really really really

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,520
funny is going to come along someday and

641
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,919
replace comedy soon but I don't know

642
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,679
what it is you know what I mean it can't

643
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,279
be called that anymore yeah it'll have

644
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,640

645
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,520
roll rock and cool and rock and roll was

646
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,919

650
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,240
I I found myself doting on particular

651
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:14,000

652
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,200

672
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,799

think of stuff to evoke a reaction but

718
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:58,200
it was not well received you know what

719
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,720
and especially by my own friends really

720
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,559

they've got talent and they don't know

729
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,000
what the hell to do with it or you're

730
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,760
bursting to contribute and you don't

731
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,200
know where to start well here's where I

732
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,039
started it's like you go home you're

733
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,159
constantly sitting there how to dream up

734
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,480
something cool to show to your friends

735
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,320
that came from you not sh and tell like

736
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,919
hey look you know look at these

737
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,559
sunglasses man yeah no something that

738
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,760
originated organically from you that was

739
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,679
you're hoping to an elicit a reaction

740
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,240
usually laughs or just whoa you know

741
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,039
something something cool yeah and you go

742
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,640
in front of them and there's no readout

743
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,760
you do something and it's just like they

744
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,440
just look at you and I used to say I

745
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,880
mean inadequate I'm I'm like

746
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,640
malfunctioning you know because I'm

747
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,120
nothing not even a boo or a yay just

748
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,919
nothing and I'd go home and I'd work on

749
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,840
it and I'd keep trying and trying I wish

750
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,960
some adult could have stuck his head

751
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,600
into my world at that time some really

752
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,799
cool adult not just your average you

753
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,919
know full of [ __ ] when I was 10 years

754
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,760
old I was convinced that that most

755
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,760
adults I knew in my Heart of Heart were

756
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,960
full of [ __ ] sure I did I was a very

757
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,399
like a little cop a little Detective

758
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,159
watching listening watching because it

759
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:36,559
would serve me later on in life of

760
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,120
course but um you know I wish somebody

761
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,559
could have come in and just said listen

762
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,200
it ain't you it's them yeah it's not you

763
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:47,640
yeah you know how would you feel if

764
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,200
every day you had to go out and somebody

765
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,320
there's this uh you know you would be a

766
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,799
constant and painful reminder of what

767
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,559
none of them will ever ever be able to

768
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,760
do mhm you know how would you

769
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,760
right and I

770
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,320
said not too good really you know the

771
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,559
same way I feel when I go watch like

772
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,559
movies and there's somebody that's

773
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,240
funnier than hell and it's like I just

774
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,720
want to be that I wish I could be that

775
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,480
but you never get the chance to say

776
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,440
anything to the guy sure you wishing but

777
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,639
that was like nebulous that was a dream

778
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,840
to you didn't even dare think like that

779
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:22,720
like how on Earth am I ever going to

780
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,360
meet that guy and you know what it comes

781
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,519
to pass that I met almost all my herir

782
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,720
up yeah that's great yeah you know I

783
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,399
mean not many people can say that no and

784
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,399
they said don't do not like whatever you

785
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,000
do don't meet your Idol because because

786
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,440
you'll be disappoint because your your

787
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,679
undying agulation and love for them

788
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,240
could turn into abject hatred so far

789
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,039
that theory turns out to be [ __ ] on

790
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,360
my show at the very least that's that's

791
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,240
the purpose of the show well you have

792
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,679
good taste I do have good taste that is

793
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,039
true but I understand that like there is

794
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,840
that that absolute fear and you know

795
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,360
growing up as a kid myself with just

796
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,240
tons of fear and OCD

797
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,320
anxiety yeah 100% yeah I just didn't

798
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,799
know I had it I thought I was judging

799
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,159
what they say my insides to everyone

800
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:11,679
else is outsides yeah and I just thought

801
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,399
in my 20s and 30s and even 40s I said

802
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,880
maybe I'm just a [ __ ] and I can't like

803
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:18,080
deal with life on life terms yeah yeah

804
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,159
but it's not even like that I finally

805
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,600
got help and the woman women have always

806
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,240
been my best teachers in life by the way

807
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,679
100% and um and she saw me she was very

808
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,200
compassionate she said tell me about

809
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,840
what you do in the morning and I said

810
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,600
well I get up you know what about your

811
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,399
career I said everything is going like

812
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,519
so great it's it's incredible and yet I

813
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,440
have no reason to silently celebrate mhm

814
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,639
it's like I don't even think of of like

815
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,840
being happy or content because I'm

816
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:49,360
fighting this other thing that appears

817
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,720
out of nowhere like what and I said I

818
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,200
wake up in the morning I'm doing okay

819
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,120
and all of a sudden my breath gets

820
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,039
staggered MH like like think of

821
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,760
something just something from 28 years

822
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,799
ago pop in my

823
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,720
and I go like I'm reliving it again

824
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,919
that's

825
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,240
OCD yeah and then I felt like there was

826
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,600
a sort of damle over my head because I

827
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,399
felt I was in nothing but trouble mhm

828
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,880
and my mind would run wild with this

829
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:15,519
stuff and she's looking at me and I and

830
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,600
she said then what and I said I go in

831
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,840
the shower and turn in the water all of

832
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,440
a sudden this black cloud just crushes

833
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,600
me down to the floor I have I just don't

834
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,480
know what to do and I go I fetal

835
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,440
position I look up at the drops going

836
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,760
down the glass and said I can't go out I

837
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,600
can't go out there yeah I just can't I

838
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,639
can't nobody would understand but but

839
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,600
then I said well you know don't worry

840
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:42,200
about it everybody has this happened to

841
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,399
them somehow they pull it together and

842
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,919
so she she had a tear in her eye and

843
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,279
looked at me and she was shaking her

844
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,039
head slowly and she said Billy nobody

845
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:52,840
has to live like that in this day and

846
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:56,120
age I said what do you mean so she sent

847
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,440
me to a pharmacologist and I I actually

848
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,279
was treated MH for all all these things

849
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,240
that were just a way of life sure and

850
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,960
you know and and I wanted who's asked to

851
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,159
you kick when you find out at 50 that

852
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,960
you had chronic lowlevel depression you

853
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:12,480
basically your whole life could have

854
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,440
been a write off right but no cuz I knew

855
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,639
I could a b

856
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,119
instantly what's good and what sucks

857
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,359
yeah you know people forget people that

858
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,200
have normal feelings and don't have in

859
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,320
lacks of chemicals and stuff I mean what

860
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,720
is it like what are you born without

861
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,359
like

862
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,040
a183 worth of chemicals MH you know and

863
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,919
that's all it is sometimes but you have

864
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,879
to have talk therapy because of how you

865
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:40,200
conducted your life as a result yeah uh

866
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,919
of having to deal with those things um

867
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,560
but I mean that's that's basically what

868
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,480
it is no levels of endorphin mhm oh

869
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,720
nothing just the thing that makes you

870
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,879
give you a sense of well-being who needs

907
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,839
amount of people yeah have those kind of

908
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,920
problems well and I mean that's that's

909
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,319
another thing too like we at the Robin

910
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,800
Williams tribute that we did over the

911
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:20,280
the weekend we're talking a bit about

912
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,760
Jonathan Winters because obviously it's

913
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,280
going to happen yeah so and we didn't

914
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,640
dwell too much on mental illness because

915
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,119
we didn't want to talk about it in a

916
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,040
[ __ ] live show but like love getting

917
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,839
into it but just cuz we were talking

918
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,319
more about his career and we had this

919
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,000
little [ __ ] right next to me and

920
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:37,160
I don't mean to that's not to insult him

921
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,880
this guy does the most intensely

922
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,839
upsettingly good Robin Williams and he

923
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,560
looks exactly like him really who is it

924
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:44,359
his name is Jamie Costa I'll show you

925
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,800
the video after YouTube video

926
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:48,880
upsettingly good upset like he was born

927
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,440
with it but also can imitate like you

928
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,599
know you can look like him but if you so

929
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,920
he's sort of like the Von meter of uh

930
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,680
absolutely right but at the very how do

931
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,119

932
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,560
want to know where are my seven now he's

00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,119
weeks ago that [ __ ] album is weird as

946
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,319
[ __ ] oh for Corn's sake

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,680
buddy oh for crying out loud buddy but

948
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:42,560
do dick F Dyke Impressions like 80 years

949
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,560
too late he's still around maybe you

950
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,720
know it's fine that's I met him once

951
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,119
yeah did you oh that was probably my

952
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,359
favorite thing on the on the Jonathan

953
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:56,520
winer's album is his impression of uh

954
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:59,359
what is it uh not bosi but um carof

955
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,800
carof it's just it's it's just he just

956
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,640
goes into it so seamlessly it's just so

957
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,400
fantastic well you know that makes me

958
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,800
think about the um the albums where they

959
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,200
had impressionist doing you know the

960
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,040
first family like the Von meter records

961
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,000
yeah um the story of Von meter in case

962
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,079
nobody knows is that you know he was an

963
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,680
impressionist and he had a damn good jnf

964
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,040
Kennedy impression so that was his

965
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,440
golden ticket as they say in Wonka land

966
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,440
you know he found his horse and carriage

967
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,560
and he was just being so popular and

968
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,920
making great records as the president

969
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,880
and the first family with other

970
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,760
Impressionists and then Kennedy was

971
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,839
assassinated and it's like the rug of

972
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,560
Life pulled out from underneath him yeah

973
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,920
I think Lenny Bruce's line was well Von

974
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,920
meter

975
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,160
screwed sounds like him yeah but um I

976
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,599
mean this guy that does Robin Williams

977
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,800
you know what if he's doing it means

978
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,119
he's got the spirit of crazy in him

979
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,160
which I applaud yeah he'll find his own

980
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,880
voice yeah he will he's got to reinvent

981
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,880
himself and stay true to what he feels

982
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,520
we were actually talking about that

983
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,720
exact same thing on the stage I mean I

984
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,200
wasn't trying to give this guy advice

985
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,440
but Rick Overton's on stage and he's not

986
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,240
one to shy away from giving people

987
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,000
advice so Rick Overton was just pumping

988
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,920
advice into this kid on stage and like

989
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,319
Rick is is one of the best I've ever

990
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,079
seen and one of the smartest that I've

991
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,680
ever seen I just I just sit there I I

992
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,319
hold all these people in real high

993
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,280
esteem I'm not like a snob that you know

994
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,800
uh I don't want to get into that or you

995
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,680
know or secretly angry because

996
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,000
somebody's funny than me I mean stand up

997
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,520
is a really hard thing I couldn't do it

998
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,240
I thought I could but you know what uh I

999
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,240
would go down go out on stage with no

1000
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,599
material because I felt like there was

1001
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,760
nothing nothing at stake if I was just

1002
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,760
spewing out 12 minutes that it took me

1003
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,520
three years to get together and write

1004
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,000
and and hone it right I just I I wasn't

1005
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,920
afraid to die that was my problem yeah

1006
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,520
if I was screwing around and I found

1007
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,079
something I was divining for Brilliance

1008
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
or whatever you want to call it if I

1009
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,359
found one thing it was worth it to me to

1010
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,000
find something that nobody had covered

1011
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,640
or or just a certain way of uh

1012
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,079
presenting something that was just

1013
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,160
really different yeah but you don't have

1014
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,560
time for mistakes sure is it was it easy

1015
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,319
to recognize how different Jonathan

1016
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,839
Winters was even as a kid though like

1017
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,079
that absolutely what was it that like

1018
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:21,680
immediately set it apart for you um if

1019
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,720
you can identify that might be well

1020
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,960
let's put it this way he wasn't London

1021
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,319
Lee or Stanley myON h handleman mhm you

1022
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,599
know these guys the comedians that would

1023
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:33,880
come on MV Griffin sure but when

1024
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,480
Jonathan wyers came out there it was an

1025
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,760
event okay I mean it was

1026
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,760
like it it it resonated the emotional

1027
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,640
resonance that came from a television a

1028
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,359
caod ray yeah and uh that was not wasted

1029
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,560
on people like me and most people

1030
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,359
because they were pretty much smart

1031
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,359
about stuff like that sure there was

1032
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:57,920
some guys that just were sort of boozy

1033
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,960
you know hey everybody comedians

1034
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,560
people that just didn't even come from

1035
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,359
that street they just came from you know

1036
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,560
like a Skyhook brought them down and

1037
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,000
left them off and then came back to get

1038
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,200
themely yeah those the one thing too is

1039
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,680
that Rick Overton was talking a bit

1040
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,440
about that Jonathan Winters to the very

1041
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,240
end was pretty Lucid in there so it's

1042
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,839
not like you can't call this crazy even

1043
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,440
though he's you know he's been he was

1044
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,880
pretty open about any mental illness he

1045
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,480
had but like it's not like that's what

1046
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,480
this was oh Red Skeleton same thing sure

1047
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,319
yeah you know they'd have to get him out

1048
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,040
of a tree oh man and Jonathan witer is

1049
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:33,640
pretty much the same thing like he would

1050
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,280
float away like helium he'd get into a

1051
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:40,440
Persona zip it up and disappear yeah and

1052
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,839
uh very hard to retrieve yeah but I mean

1053
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,160
it was because there was a part of him

1054
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:49,119
that was reticent that that was sort of

1055
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,880
afraid to be who and what he was and I

1056
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,560
certainly understand that it's a safe

1057
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,240
you know the shoreline is always right

1058
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,480
within distance if you're if you're

1059
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,720
mimicking or or you got a thing that

1060
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,119
makes people laugh yeah um but to get

1061
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,280
help helps you reinvent yourself into

1062
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,560
more of what you needed to be yeah yeah

1063
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,359
is there something specific about

1064
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,400
mimicking is it a comfort thing it is

1065
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,640
but it just came natural to me I didn't

1066
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,040
think much about it oh hi I had a great

1067
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,520

you and I said well I got some pictures

1077
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,680
I want to get rid of them give them to a

1078
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,400
buddy

1079
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,280
and so I said um here here they are and

1080
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,760
what they were were

1081
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,800
statues of the museum there clown had

1082
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,040
given me the

1083
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,400
shaft uh

1084
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,480
and of course I got the shaft in a

1085
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,839
number of towns but I just want to warn

1086
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,280
you if you ever do get over there while

1087
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,240
you know just be careful that's all they

1088
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,200
are is just those statues don't means

1089
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,160
nothing you know unless you dig statues

1090
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,359
I

1091
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,559
don't I find them awfully

1092
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:20,359
cold

1093
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:22,000
um but I crawled up in the arms of a big

1094
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:24,880
one one day and the guy took a picture

1095
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,079
of me that's the first time I went away

1096
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,760
but um

1097
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,280
faite on this album there's a lot of

1098
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,079
really I'm trying to remember you got to

1099
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,960
refresh me because I haven't heard it in

1100
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,079
a million years okay all right all right

1101
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,119
uh well there's a side one is just

1102
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,640
entitled opening California and he talks

1103
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,079
about San Jose and pronouncing at St

1104
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,599
Joe's being a little confused that I

1105
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,240
remember that you know why because when

1106
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,520
I first came out here I saw La Siena and

1107
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:57,079
I said to my friends you know what that

1108
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,079
means don't you the Siena

1109
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,960
see that's brilliant I I got so much

1110
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,880
mileage for about 8 seconds after LeBron

1111
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,040
James came on the scene in the NBA CU I

1112
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,760
turned all my friends and I was like Wow

1113
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,720
LeBron you know actually that's a very

1114
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,440
famous name it's French and they go

1115
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,559

1121
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,920

prevalent see everything oh that's

1169
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,880
funny uh let's I made a few notes about

1170
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,480
just some good bits on here where he's

1171
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,559
just oh we's talking about going there's

1172
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,359
just one really funny bit where he's

1173
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,200
talking about going to a movie and how

1174
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:45,640
you bring your snacks your blah a box of

1175
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,480
clothes there was just this line a box

1176
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,359
of clothes was the funniest line to me

1177
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,599
and I don't know why but that's but that

1178
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,839
was

1179
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,839
him that was him taking Divine dictation

1180
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,680
that's the only way I can put it like

1181
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:01,640
whatever broadcast

1182
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,240
Center that that was aiming towards him

1183
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,200
and he had the only receiver in the

1184
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,240
world or one of the few yeah that's what

1185
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,160
would happen yeah you know just

1186
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,640
something would pop out

1187
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,760
but but he

1188
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,240
also he walked on a net he lived on the

1189
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,240
net mhm you know uh without one

1190
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,559
underneath I meant the line he walked on

1191
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,000
the Trap the what do you call it the the

1192
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,680
Highwire high wire act that no that was

1193
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,599
him and I think like people like Eddie

1194
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,160
is are kind of tuned into that same

1195
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,520
frequency because you can tell like like

1196
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,119
especially in that like the going to the

1197
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,160
movies bit he he was like okay this is

1198
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,920
when I go into the list and then he just

1199
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,160
you see his brain literally leap three

1200
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,280
feet out of his head and he's just like

1201
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,880
I'm going to come up with things on a

1202
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,480
list you know it's like yeah you got

1203
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,440
your popcorn your milk dge bag of

1204
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,920
clothes you know your lobster thermador

1205
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,640
your you know butterfly net you you know

1206
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,880
and like and he just and he's going and

1207
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,000
he and he comes right back to the movie

1208
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,520
things so you don't even notice and and

1209
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,720
that's like EDD Eddie isard sometimes

1210
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,680
he'll go off on something and he's

1211
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,960
coming up with the list and all of a

1212
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,520
sudden there's toast and jam and

1213
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,079
whatever the hell else before it comes

1214
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,920
back to yeah but but he'll always but I

1215
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,440
think Jonathan winer's probably had a

1216
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,119
loose sketch of what he might do sure I

1217
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,200
don't think he ever did it the same way

1218
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,119
twice and that's what's so amazing is

1219
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,880
like listening to these bits is you'll

1220
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,640
hear people do stuff on albums and

1221
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,119
they'll trip over themselves or have

1222
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,520
little catches or whatever he you know

1223
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,920
this is all coming stream of

1224
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,960
Consciousness and there is not a lag

1225
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,559
there's no filter it's going right from

1226
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,839
his brain out of his mouth and it's

1227
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:31,520
incredible

1228
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:35,920
um I don't know he he would scan

1229
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,160
everything and everything for its uh

1230
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,599
potential for being personified

1231
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,400
personification like you know oh little

1232
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:45,280
bluebird you know and he would just

1233
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,440
start messing with it and there is a

1234
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,520
little bird here and it's like you know

1235
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,480
tweet stole all its ideas from me

1236
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,440
Twitter you know you can't see it but

1237
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,880
and it is blue it's Robin's egg blue

1238
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:02,160
it's ceramic that's real cute too bad if

1239
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,160
something were to happen to

1240
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,200
it thanks guys

1241
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,440
yeah thank you for breaking I just broke

1242
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,960
your bird you know I mean that's pure

1243
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,559
John of the winers yeah yeah and what

1244
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,160
what I was noticing too is just like if

1245
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:16,960
you look if you were to try and break

1246
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,760
this down if you felt like it the

1247
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,160
premises are so so incredibly simple oh

1248
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,160
yeah just to give himself so much room

1249
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,640
to play well he would say you know he

1250
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,480
demonstrate in like one minute 100

1251
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,640
things you can do with a pen and pencil

1252
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,040
like what they can become

1253
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:35,520
mhm uh yeah those bits on there I

1254
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,440
remember a lot of them and it it made me

1255
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:43,559
think like that pretty much early on

1256
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:45,799
before I uh before I put together things

1257
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:49,000
M the way most people are supposed to

1258
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:50,520
yeah you know like uh I can remember

1259
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,680
like I have a hard time remembering

1260
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,720
movies I remember certain parts of them

1261
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,359
because that's what I fixated on right I

1262
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,280
went to see

1263
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:04,319
um I went to see the deep blue mhm that

1264
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,599
beautiful film about the divers that

1265
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,839
were going down so deep no one had ever

1266
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,079
gone that without

1267
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:13,119
equipment and they would just go you

1268
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:17,240
know and uh this one guy fell in love

1269
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,160
with a dolphin mhm and everything and I

1270
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,680
didn't like pay a whole lot of attention

1271
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,599
to the dialogue yeah you know what I was

1272
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,440
doing was watching the sea and its

1273
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:29,000
different forms and I got lost in it

1274
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,240
yeah and so I'm watching this peripheral

1275
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,640
corner of the movie and somebody how'd

1276
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,440
you like it I said it was beautiful you

1277
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:39,920
mean like the plot and the characters no

1278
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,520
beautiful I was lost yeah the

1279
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,559
ocean no and that makes perfect sense is

1280
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,720
that that's where if you have that

1281
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,000
certain type of brain that's just how

1282
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,079
shit's going to work for you um did so

1283
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,079
when you first starting doing comedy and

1284
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,799
stuff were you at any point inspired

1285
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:00,400
directly by Jonathan Winters or were you

1286
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:02,799
just your own thing when you kind it had

1287
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,799
a tendency to try to be that way cuz

1288
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:09,119
when I prepared um written material mhm

1289
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:11,760
it just wasn't funny okay and it wasn't

1290
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,920
coming from me totally it was coming

1291
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,480
from what I thought I should be doing

1292
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,520
okay yeah yeah yeah you know and it it's

1293
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,079
like there's a disconnect there sure you

1294
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,559
want this unbroken pure connection your

1295
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,640
mind your heart your body and your soul

1296
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:30,799
mhm it should be like sort of joined up

1297
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,480
and then it rings true to people yeah um

1298
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:34,119
Louis CK you know I mean he couldn't

1299
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,200
spend the rest of his life life

1300
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:39,079
imitating George

1301
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,640
Carlin no and he said it himself yeah

1302
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,960
yeah and he did he did a great Carlin he

1303
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,520
was doing his best Louis CK doing George

1304
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,920
Carlin but he was never going to be as

1305
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,160
good as Lis CK was going to be and it

1306
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,599
was never going to be as good as

1307
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,839
Carlin's going to be right and you'll

1308
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,440
become a footnote to either one yourself

1309
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,319
or him yeah the other

1310
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,960
guy there I mean he even play he somehow

1311
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:01,640
makes hey out of the lights go out twice

1312
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,079
in this album and he just somehow he

1313
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,280
gets a laugh both times the lights go

1314
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,200
out of course yeah because he's dealing

1315
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,359
with it and that's one of those things

1316
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,760
that I saw and and you notice when

1317
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:11,720
you're like a young comedian you're

1318
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,640
stealing from people it's like the [ __ ]

1319
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,280
that blows your mind is when you're like

1320
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,920
wow this is just something that I know

1321
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,359
is not planned or anything else and he's

1322
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,520
got the audience still right or she's

1323
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:21,839
gotten the audience right in their

1324
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,200
pocket yeah and I mean and holding on to

1325
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,799
it you know I watch Gregory Hines do it

1326
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,960
once you know like and you see it in

1327
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:30,559
bizarre places I went to go see um 12th

1328
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,200
night Shakespeare in the park in New

1329
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,359
York and Gregory Hines was playing feste

1330
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,319
and all of a sudden the sound crapped up

1331
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,359
and the sound went out and there was a

1332
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:41,559
technical problem and all the lights

1333
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:43,520
went and he had to riff as feste I mean

1334
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:44,640
like he couldn't do it all on I am pamer

1335
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,720
but he stayed in character for like

1336
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,960
three and a half minutes very fertile

1337
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,720
ground you got it but he went for it he

1338
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,079
he went and he Dove right into the

1339
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,839
audience first row I got rich New

1340
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,880
Yorkers in the front row let's make fun

1341
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,680
of these people awesome that's part

1342
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,920
Panic mhm and that's how you

1343
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,720
overcompensate for being mortified you

1344
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,680
know and so I think I'll dive into the

1345
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,760
front row and but he started with the

1346
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,880
material what and give up Show Business

1347
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,599
yeah you got it wrists and then he had

1348
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,960
them and by the time it came back on he

1349
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,400
just seamlessly went right back into the

1350
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,640
lines and everybody gave him this giant

1351
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,280
almost Standing Ovation you know and

1352
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,559
because he never never let it drop well

1353
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,160
see the thing about Jonathan witer is

1354
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,680
something like that happened to him

1355
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,880
happens to him and he doesn't have the

1356
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,880
standard what to do if this happens or

1357
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,240
that happens he wasn't his brain was not

1358
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,960
concerned with those things right cuz

1359
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,720
you know once you've set boundaries like

1360
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,079
one night something or other is bound to

1361
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,680
happen so I better be prepared with like

1362
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,079
some

1363
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,640
witty dialogue or something yeah uh Hey

1364
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:51,680
I just made that up you know um it's

1365
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,839
it's almost like most comedians had

1366
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,079
something ready yeah like a

1367
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,920
standard in Show Business was like the

1368
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,160
Henny young man thing you know he's like

1369
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,960
uh I solved the parking problem I bought

1370
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,599
a parked car and if you heard a door

1371
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,240
slam he'd go and stay out right of

1372
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:09,240
course you know I mean but those were

1373
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:12,400
like MH they knew exactly what to do

1374
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:15,440
when little junk happened in a club yeah

1375
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,359
you know broken glasses or whatever yeah

1376
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,799
I feel like Jonathan Winters any of this

1377
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:22,440
was an opportunity to play yeah anything

1378
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:24,119
that happened yeah why do why do some

1379
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,960
old hack need bit when there's a chance

1380
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,359
to do something new in the moment why

1381
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,640
because most people couldn't handle that

1382
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,240
though that kind of [ __ ] pressure you

1383
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,720
would think on somebody and I don't know

1384
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,440
the specifics of his mental illness uh I

1385
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,119
just know that that would kill me I

1386
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,079
don't you talk about Robin Williams no

1387
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,280
no just just Jonathan Winters like just

1388
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,000
being able to I don't know you know

1389
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,920
there's a common theme Here of all these

1390
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,799
brilliant bastards uhhuh that's you know

1391
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,400
I mean I could raise my hand mhm I

1392
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,359
didn't have screwed up Rain waves where

1393
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,680
I needed to kill people right luckily

1394
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:57,880
you know or animals but but I mean I was

1395
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,480
in my own way through no fall of my own

1396
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,040
and it makes you behave certain ways and

1397
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,160
a lot of it is destruction destructive

1398
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,160
cuz somehow you don't think you're good

1399
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,240
enough no matter what you can't hear

1400
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,359
laughter when they're roaring and even

1401
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,880
if it is laughter it's it's not even

1402
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,359
given that thing where it's not not the

1403
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,079
right kind of laugh yep but you know do

1404
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,039
you know what I realized early early on

1405
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,440
that even Robin

1406
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:25,799
Williams uh would fall into these places

1407
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,039
when you when you listen to and perform

1408
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:31,680
where

1409
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:34,559
he was he was um not confident in his

1410
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,799
own stuff so he was Notorious because he

1411
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,799
was sort of a fast forward Thief sure

1412
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,280
sure he he claimed that he was so quick

1413
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,640
that if he heard something that he

1414
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,559
didn't know whether it was his or

1415
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,400
someone else's he even stole the title

1416
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,079
to his first album reality with a

1417
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,960
concept that was some schlubs bit you

1418
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:54,000
know that was all he had that was it and

1419
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,079
he used to say you know Robin why and uh

1420
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,480
Robin paid him of course of course yeah

1421
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,280
I mean he paid him a lot of money sure

1422
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,200
but but I mean uh that's that speaks

1423
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,160
volumes about how even he was like

1424
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:09,880
unsure if what he was doing was working

1425
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,119
yeah yeah you know and that's a great uh

1426
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,599
Temptation MH when you panic you know

1427
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:16,319
you just grab some line see if you can

1428
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,720
get a laugh but I was not like I said I

1429
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,480
was never afraid to die sure yeah some

1430
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,079
nights it would be like brilliant and

1431
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,440
some nights it' be like going to hell on

1432
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,440
a twisted metal Fireball

1433
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,640
grease Pole to

1434
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:33,359
Hell the best kind of comy do you know

1435
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,039
are there just off the top of your head

1436
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,559
are there any because he actually does

1437
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:37,920
he actually even breaks down and talks

1438
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,960
about Impressions on this which I think

1439
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,200
is [ __ ] fantastic going from Walter

1440
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,920
brenon to JFK is a really good bit like

1441
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,000
just like you just have to do this and

1442
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,039
it's [ __ ] fantastic well those were

1443
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,079
the guys who were observant observant

1444
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:54,760
enough to pick up and invent the

1445
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,760
impression of someone in their time like

1446
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,520
we always Carrie Grant never said Judy

1447
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,280
Judy Judy but you know who did Larry

1448
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,200
storage oh right right right yeah you

1449
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,039
know Judy Judy Judy you know and that

1450
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,880
was because the the rhythm of it would

1451
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:09,240
commit you to the laugh just the pure

1452
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,559
rhythm of

1453
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:15,520
it and um and that it hit and it was the

1454
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:18,079
way Carrie Grant would speak anyway

1455
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,359
because it was almost like a getting gun

1456
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,240
you know when I saw those two big

1457
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:25,440
beautiful boobs I knew that I was in

1458
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,920
trouble you know like declarative I was

1459
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,319
just watching some like get hot and I'm

1460
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,839
like I'm watching Tony Curtis I'm like

1461
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:34,799
that is the worst impression I've ever

1462
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:36,400
heard but he makes it work God damn it I

1463
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,799
know well that's you could apply that to

1464
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,359
cartoons too even a lousy impression of

1465
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,520
somebody's a voice no one's ever heard

1466
00:57:40,359 --> 00:57:46,200
before exactly yeah you know so I'm not

1467
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:49,760
afraid to do that like Nixon in Futurama

1468
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:53,079
so great well that bastard drafted me in

1469
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,920
1970 and um and they were stenciling my

1470
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:56,640
name on the Foot Locker I in the draft

1471
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,960
lottery I had number 30

1472
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,920
I was going to go to

1473
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:06,240
Vietnam so um so I went nutty and tried

1474
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,520
to drink tons of sea water you know and

1475
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,920
uh what else take a tablespoon of

1476
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,160
linseed oil and give yourself a

1477
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,440
temporary heart murmur none of that

1478
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,160
worked but what did work was I had

1479
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,319
hypertension already and I had the

1480
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,160
flattest feet they would suck the floor

1481
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:27,240
if I was there for you know they were

1482
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:29,000
just flat and uh so I got out but

1483
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,880
I mean that was that was harrowing

1484
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,680
because I just got out of high school I

1485
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,760
was playing in bands had a guitar

1486
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,760
shaking my tush around you know in

1487
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,119
Hispanic Hispanic pants and you know I

1488
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,760
didn't even have any lines I didn't have

1489
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,440
to pick up girls they would just be

1490
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,839
right there in your face and I was a bad

1491
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,079
boy I drank and did a little drugs you

1492
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:53,720
know so I was cross addicted but for

1493
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:56,799
some reason these girls wanted a

1494
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:58,280
project they needed a project you know I

1495
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,200
know I can you know it's like they think

1496
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,280
they're

1497
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,280
pigan you know and I was like this

1498
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:08,960
smashed Elija D little

1499
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,960
E I got a get S you

1500
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,440
say um you know but

1501
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:20,280
um but Nixon you know that whole thing

1502
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:22,559
is I didn't have to go there and so

1503
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,760
let's see cut to a million years in the

1504
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,000
future you know to this very day in the

1505
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:33,119
Nixon

1506
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,599
Library on a complete um Loop MH is all

1507
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,240
the [ __ ] that I did as Nixon on

1508
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,240
Futurama really his

1509
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,640

whole Library that's F Oh They'll

1511
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,680
probably take it out because I made

1512
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,920
reference to it a million times told

1513
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,359
what a bastard he was oh no I mean I'm

1514
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,720
sure they'll love it cuz they're trying

1515
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:56,240
to update it can I tell you why I did

1516
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,760
that though most people just are like

1517
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,240
why or just it's beautiful I don't know

1518
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:04,520
maybe he did that or something but no he

1519
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:08,799
never did that I saw the debate between

1520
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:12,000
him and John F Kennedy in 19 what was it

1521
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:13,680
60 is it 60 Jesus Christ yeah what about

1522
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,480
on TV it was the first televised

1523
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,400
presidential debate ever so it was kind

1524
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,720
of significant and they had these

1525
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:23,000
close-ups of Nixon like as close as they

1526
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:25,720
could you can see his car is opening and

1527
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,559
closing letting little fluid out and the

1528
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,240
hair

1529
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,240
that are inside of

1530
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:35,520
them yeah it's like Rena sty gross

1531
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:37,400
closeup oil panc of like his tooth or

1532
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,200
you know so anyway here he is and he's

1533
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,520
like I don't see why

1534
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,799
I'm and while it was going on he was

1535
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:48,240
sweating and his 5:00 shadow was coming

1536
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:51,039
in like

1537
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,240
2:15 and he was like I started to look

1538
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,720
at him when I said to my mom mom he

1539
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,680
looks like he's going to turn into a

1540
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,880
werewolf

1541
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,799
and so I I I sat there you know it's

1542
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,520
like Larry tall but you know whatever

1543
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:06,960
you do no matter what you hear keep the

1544
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:09,760
door why do he sound like a southwest

1545
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,760
Indian Mexican I think it was a thing

1546
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,839
back then it's like it was good to sound

1547
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,160
like you had crackers or cotton in your

1548
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:18,839
mouth somehow I don't know why Church

1549
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,480
Alfred Hitchcock I didn't know he was a

1550
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:25,720
role model ass I have some sort of

1551
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,640
impendence you now get to the annoyance

1552
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:31,280
that interrupts all this art with what

1553
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,079
they call the

1554
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,280
commercial yeah I guess that made you

1555
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:36,520
more important than you were you talk

1556
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,680
like a

1557
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:43,000
hamster but but um but I mean there it

1558
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,440
was playing in the museum and um that's

1559
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,680
great that's amazing but I mean I did

1560
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:49,319
that because he really truly looked like

1561
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:52,680
he was going to break out into like like

1562
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:55,440
canob whatever you call you got it yeah

1563
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,319
you know liuan he was very liuan towards

1564
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,279
the end of the debate and I just thought

1565
01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:00,279
he was going my fellow

1566
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:05,080
[Laughter]

1567
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,079
American he would have got more votes

1568
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:15,079
then the writers on the show wondered

1569
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:18,319
why they said why do you do that that

1570
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:20,839
aroo thing and he says don't don't I

1571
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,359
mean don't ever stop because we love it

1572
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:25,240
and we're looking for ways to just put

1573
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:27,640
it in everywhere but they also followed

1574
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,799
suit with version of agnu who had no

1575
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:32,599
head but could still

1576
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:35,160
go one of my favorite futureama bits the

1577
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:37,359
headless body of agnu which is just I

1578
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,279
think it's bril it is it is there was so

1579
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:41,400
much that you could comment on in that

1580
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:43,440
show it was everything and anything I

1581
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,680
ever dreamed of being part of on every

1582
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,000
level mhm as a matter of

1583
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,480
fact somebody said what's it like you

1584
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,680
know to just like hear your voice coming

1585
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,240
out of everywhere on TV and radios and I

1586
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,880
said it's surreal and the problem with

1587
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,079
it is

1588
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,440
um I have to pretend it wasn't me that

1589
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:04,720
did it otherwise I'll rip myself to

1590
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,359
shreds yeah with self-critique yeah you

1591
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,880
know if I hear it it's like a lot of

1592
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:10,520
times I don't go back and listen to

1593
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,200
stuff that I did if it's like radio

1594
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:15,720
interviews or even this you know it's

1595
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,760
like I don't revisit it that willingly

1596
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:21,640
because because I'll you know what it is

1597
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,960
I got a heart and a soul see and and if

1598
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:26,880
I say stuff that is just like makes

1599
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:30,720
makes me get the do chills you know it's

1600
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,880
like why did you say that um I I can't

1601
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,079
stand it yeah and I I would have I would

1602
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,599
have done it like this or I would have

1603
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,960
said that you know you never it never

1604
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,559
clicks off you have to just live with it

1605
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,960
you compartmentalize you pretend you had

1606
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:42,160
nothing to do with it yeah yeah and the

1607
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,359
worst part is is you know when you don't

1608
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,079
even have say over which edit or which

1609
01:03:44,359 --> 01:03:47,520
take they're going to use like even if

1610
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,160
you did a great job or think you did

1611
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,799
you're like why they use that take damn

1612
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:54,720
it well that's that's you know the

1613
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:57,000
people that you know just have something

1614
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,920
in them that that you drive yourself to

1615
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,200
become what you think is a superlative

1616
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,760
and nothing less you won't settle for

1617
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,680
anything less in yourself yeah and a lot

1618
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,880
of people just can't let that go a lot

1619
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,640
of history all through this territory uh

1620
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,680

1757
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,159
exactly well donut is um when you get a

01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,480
Ross couldn't get through it so he had

1809
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,120
this like like someone stuck him in the

1810
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,780

01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:25,560
know him worried about ruining this heed

1881
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,000
me

1882
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,840
you know there's a real quick bit on

1883
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,639
here and I don't mean to derail us

1884
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,880
actually no actually it's not because I

1885
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:37,120
know I'm I'm rerailing rerailing exactly

1886
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,040
there is one bit his voice where he's

1887
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,199
doing the it would be an offensive bit

1888
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,080
but it's not cuz he's making fun of

1889
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:44,159
movies where he does this native Chief

1890
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,800
and it sounds exactly like every Frank

1891
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,560
Welker old man voice that I've ever

1892
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,040
heard and it's really makes me wonder if

1893
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,239
I just wonder if that that could just be

1894
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,280
frank Welker's natural thing that he

1895
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:54,440
does but just coming from that bit you

1896
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,920
know that coming from the back of the

1897
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,360
throat everything comes from somewhere

1898
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:02,760
everything including Jonathan

1899
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,239
wyers he was exposed to that somewhere

1900
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,639
mm yeah and he says it I mean almost

1901
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:07,719
everything he bites off of he's like oh

1902
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:09,679
it's like so and so or this guy or this

1903
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:12,520
person and he does this weird hybrid

1904
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:15,800
cultural references and but but he put

1905
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:19,120
it in his own blender and like there's

1906
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:21,880
nothing more unfunny than like an

1907
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:25,560
impressionist doing dead on Impressions

01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:28,840

1912
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:38,080

don't know no you know what it is and I

2081
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,080

that is see that's the thing we're doing

2093
01:22:55,719 --> 01:22:59,560
the right thing now by explaining what

2094
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,840
all this [ __ ] means it's education yeah

2095
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:03,239
because I mean the older I got I if I

2096
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,199
was with like a younger girl or

2097
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:07,800

01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:10,600
in a museum you know like I'd always has

2099
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,360
to preface everything I said was uh you

2100
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,920
know a long time ago like before you

2101
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,480

2102
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,760
you know and they were real cool and I

2103
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,920
dug them

2104
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,760
man you know and I'm not supposed to

2105
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:25,400

and out of bands when those guys were

2111
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,520
sitting in their own [ __ ] so it's like

2112
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,120
it's hard for me to have any holy

2113
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,480
reverence for anybody uhhuh yeah yeah

2114
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:47,120

um not too far from Grace Cathedral am I

2183
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,480
well I'll cut across and say a few

2184
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,960
before I

2185
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,440
go well those episcopalians need help

2186
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,560
and I'm one of

2187
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,960
them you know what that is an

2188
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,400
Episcopalian that's a Catholic that

2189
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,400
flunked his

2190
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,760
laddin but it's a minority group don't

2191
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,199
knock it too hard you know crazy that I

2192
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,840
would ever have and I do it a lot and I

2193
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,920
probably annoy my friends online but

2194
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,840
like I speak out a lot about people who

2195
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,400
are [ __ ] to people because they've

2196
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:08,199
got as much privilege as you can

2197
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,080
possibly have and then the internet

2198
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:11,719
compounds that privilege you know and

2199
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,960
it's it's just [ __ ] upsetting when

2200
01:27:11,719 --> 01:27:14,239
it's just like there's Talent there's

2201
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,119
Talent there's people yeah but the thing

2202
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:18,159
that bothers me is I grew up and I was a

2203
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:21,400
young

2204
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:24,400
man and I was you know I experienced the

2205
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:26,679
feminist movement at its beginnings

2206
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,080
and I actually before I graduated from

2207
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:30,080
high school and this is the truth I'm

2208
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:32,280
not you know wearing my heart on my

2209
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:35,639
sleeve or be a feminist feminist Hustler

2210
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:38,840
or anything like that but I read the

2211
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:41,760
female unic by J Germaine Greer I read

2212
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:43,119
the women's room by um Marilyn French

2213
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,040
these were all feminists that were

2214
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:47,000
writing and they were angry they were

2215
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:50,400
pissed off the only one who wasn't was

2216
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,480
Germaine Greer she loved men but she had

2217
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:55,199
a lot of she felt that they were in sore

2218
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:58,119
need of Rehabilitation yeah which is you

2219
01:27:55,199 --> 01:28:01,280
know hey you know what that means that

2220
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:03,440
you think there's hope sure you know and

2221
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:07,119
uh so I read all these things because I

2222
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,960
wanted to understand why when I when I

2223
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:12,760
was raised I was raised old school I'm a

2224
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:15,080
gentleman I was raised by a woman um I

2225
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:18,360
I'm evolved I get it I leave the seat

2226
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:20,760
down you know the works yep you know I

2227
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,920
would stand if a woman entered the room

2228
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,639
at a table in a dining room or if I I

2229
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:27,239
would stand if she had to leave for a

2230
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,600
minute sure you know and and I would

2231
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:30,960
hold the doors and you know it's good

2232
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,440
for me it's a good thing for me that I

2233
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,960
don't look like

2234
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:36,840
Meatloaf I mean at my I'm 63 years old

2235
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,400
are you talking about the food or the

2236
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:41,639
singer well he was one on the same I

2237
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:44,639
know was close one had slightly more

2238
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:48,320
hair well meatloaf is a product of

2239
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:49,480
itself I think but um but you know I

2240
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,639
would hold the doors and I would be

2241
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,840
going out with a young girl what I'm

2242
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:56,040
saying is that I you know not when I was

2243
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:58,239
63 I'm 63 now but like 10 15 years ago I

2244
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:00,600
could still go out with young girls but

2245
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:02,159
they were Hollow victories you know what

2246
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,239
I mean and they didn't it wasn't because

2247
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:06,560
I told him who I was or what I did you

2248
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:10,360
know that was just like does that even

2249
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:12,000
really matter so uh so I hold the door

2250
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,080
and the girl would be there in shock

2251
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,440
like looking at me suspiciously like

2252
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,239
what are you doing I'm holding the door

2253
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:21,080
for

2254
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:23,199
you why you know and then it it it

2255
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:25,679
occurred to me that most young guys are

2256
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:28,159
into this whole m misogyny thing just to

2257
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:30,639
just to rub it in yeah you know and I

2258
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:33,159
was appalled don't that that [ __ ]

2259
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:35,080
doesn't play with me it never did yeah

2260
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:37,000
you know and so now it's really funny to

2261
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,840
do rape jokes and everything and it's

2262
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,800
like you know I I

2263
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,800
just I don't want to live on this planet

2264
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,440
anymore [ __ ] uh there's a that's one of

2265
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:53,520
my favorite memes actually that it's

2266
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,480
Farnsworth and that one and all you have

2267
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,480
to do is will put up any horrible

2268
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,639
atrocity so one picture of it and then

2269
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:03,000
put that one at the bottom and I go yep

2270
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:05,760
it you got it yeah but you know I mean

2271
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,960

it's it's Little Britain one more it's

2311
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:57,520
11 I mean not to be like judgmental or

2312
01:31:54,280 --> 01:32:00,000
or like snoody about it no ke and Peele

2313
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,960
I mean it's just like thank God where do

2314
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,520
these people come from usually Britain

2315
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:07,760
yeah right right you know why because

2316
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:09,080
it's not about crassness mhm over there

2317
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,600
they they do have I mean like they do

2318
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:12,320
have their fair amount of you know like

2319
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,239
their toilet humor but I don't think

2320
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:16,679
they need to rely on it or for you they

2321
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:18,920
need to rely as much as American a seems

2322
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:21,480
victimless for the most part sure sure

2323
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:24,360
sure I always love that stuff yeah even

2324
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:27,360
though I'm a mean bad Moulder MH you

2325
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:29,639
know but I try to keep a lid on

2326
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:31,119
it like Courtney Love everywhere

2327
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:32,719
Courtney Love in my face and everything

2328
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:35,080
and it said I want that in my face as

2329
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:38,360
much as I want a dirty soil

2330
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:40,880
diaper which is what she looks like and

2331
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:43,800

01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:47,639
deliberately make her look like that mhm

2333
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:49,080
mhm yeah sorry about that that's all

2334
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:50,840

2335
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:53,520
your first album was written entirely by

songs that have about babies being born

2381
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:38,239
in a

2382
01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:40,760
dumpster you know and you're

2383
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:43,199
crying about what you even had to do

2384
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:46,320
black lipstick on your lower lip I mean

2385
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,880
how effective how affected is that you

2386
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,280
know it's like the guy the white guy

2387
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,520
that comes from money with his head in

2388
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:56,320
his hand like looking downward like

2389
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:58,440
should I kill myself today this evening

2390
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:01,040
and uh and

2391
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,719
so I was like thinking about all this

2392
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,520
stuff and and like there's so many

2393
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,320
followers they're going to be old too

2394
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,360
all the kids that listen to that stuff

2395
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,400
and they're going to be in the nursing

2396
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:11,159
home on piano night and some old guy's

2397
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:20,320
going to come in and pull out the song

2398
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:24,360
book he be like um I am in pain thing

2399
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:26,239
somebody kill me come on

2400
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:30,480
sing you know and they're all sitting

2401
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:30,480
there I am doll

2402
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,880
Parts I think Eddie Murphy did it did

2403
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,199
the said that once in his bit it just

2404
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,520
like what's GNA happen like when our

2405
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:43,280
generation gets old and we're all

2406
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,719
sitting around in the nursing home like

2407
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:48,480
reminiscing go like oh man your mother

2408
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:51,119
could sure do the butt you know it's

2409
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:53,040
like dou yeah exactly um you know what I

2410
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,400
never I never heard that bit but that's

2411
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:57,400
what I kept thinking thinking about is

2412
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,960
like that's what happens to new music it

2413
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:01,719
becomes ancient music and yet there are

2414
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:03,920
still people that that was their frame

2415
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:05,000
of reference that was their Touchstone

2416
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,719
or like wouldn't that be one of the

2417
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,920
things to put Kiran over the edge like

2418
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,119
you know like you think you're writing

2419
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,920
something that's you know personal and

2420
01:36:10,119 --> 01:36:13,840
and emotive and you to misconnect with

2421
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,280
somebody and all of a sudden you get in

2422
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,400
you know the elevator at the record

2423
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,920
company and there's a musac version of

2424
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,440
the thing that you wrote you know and

2425
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:22,719
you got to listen to it going all the

2426
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:24,400
way up you know going really this is

2427
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:25,679
what we went with here okay I'm worried

2428
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,600
I'm going to get played out by chumba

2429
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,840
WBA I'm I'm really worried that on my

2430
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,000
last breath that shit's going to be

2431
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:32,400
playing in the background it'll be

2432
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,560
totally worth it yeah I get what do you

2433
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,119
want what do you want played that your

2434
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,000
just seriously just thinking about that

2435
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:41,360
that's exactly I think about it all the

2436
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,560
time rivers to cross I know it's really

2437
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,840
stereotypical but I love Jamaican music

2438
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,040
and I think it's gorgeous I'm half

2439
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:49,239
tempted to make it music comedy that's

2440
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,679
insane it's not insane no no no I'm

2441
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:52,440
trying to think of something like

2442
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:54,600
something fun like for me I think it

2443
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:56,480
would be comedy though me the emperor's

2444
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:58,639
theme you know from Star Wars just

2445
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:00,960
looped over and over again until all the

2446
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:04,159
Flames have died down I want that a

2447
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:06,119
little uh imperious and po probably I

instruments yeah they're perfectly

2456
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:29,920
capable musicians but they they're

2457
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:31,239
playing sheet music with other people's

2458
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,159
instruments everybody in the orchestra

2459
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:34,560

01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:32,199
audience loved it they love the piece of

2484
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:34,119
music and just the the visual that went

2485
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:36,599
that's the stuff I live for it was so

2486
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:38,320
much I love that piece that's awesome

2487
01:38:36,599 --> 01:38:41,239
wow yeah I need to hear that so that so

2488
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:43,560
my frame of references is pretty much

2489
01:38:41,239 --> 01:38:45,840
like the time that the Wonder Years for

2490
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:48,639
me was kind of like when that album came

2491
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,119
out I saw Atlantis the Lost Continent by

2492
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:53,719
George pal I went and saw The Time

2493
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:55,440
Machine like four times Rod Taylor it

2494
01:38:53,719 --> 01:39:00,119
was made in 60 I think it was released

2495
01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:02,480
in 61 okay and uh so good yeah I mean

2496
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:04,639
but that's the stuff that my head was

2497
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:06,719
filled with and before I went to school

2498
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:08,000
we talked about before I went to school

2499
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:11,440
every morning they showed the three

2500
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:14,599
stoes so I had no use or room for

2501
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:16,679
Academia I had a head full of this stuff

2502
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:18,599
but you know what it was it served me

2503
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:20,560
better in life than anything I learned

2504
01:39:18,599 --> 01:39:22,520
in school because anything I was forced

2505
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,480
to learn in grammar school kindergarten

2506
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,320
grade school high school school would

2507
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:29,719
have no practical application in the

2508
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:31,679
year 2015 yeah it just wouldn't so I

2509
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:33,639
might as well have never gone to school

2510
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:36,280
I was right I you know I just wanted to

2511
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:37,880
to listen to the Stooges to the point

2512
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:39,800
where I couldn't enjoy them anymore so I

2513
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:42,040
began to look for stuff in the corners

2514
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,920
of the picture to obsess on and it was

2515
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:48,400
Larry chewing up scenery so the little

2516
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:51,920
that he said was just like Sublime to me

2517
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:53,440
be careful Mo you know and just add and

2518
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:55,719
everybody could do Mo and curly but no

2519
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:57,639
gave a damn about lar hey Mo there's too

2520
01:39:55,719 --> 01:40:00,440
much Tinsel in the

2521
01:39:57,639 --> 01:40:01,920
tree which is where Stimson J cat came

2522
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:04,320
from and I was actually I remember

2523
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,560
seeing the first episode of Ren and

2524
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:09,880
Stimpy uh when they released it I was I

2525
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:11,560
was in high school and I was obsessed

2526
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:13,239
with any new cartoons especially if they

2527
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:15,599
came out on Nick because Nick was doing

2528
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:16,719
stuff that no one else Saturday morning

2529
01:40:15,599 --> 01:40:18,080
got it I mean not Saturday morning

2530
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,639
Sunday morning they wanted to do

2531
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,119

01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,920
when Ren snippy came on the first time

2536
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:32,080

01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,320
her and I'm getting

2658
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:33,760
aroused you know I don't I'm not sure

2659
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,440
why because maybe it was cuz it was

2660
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,960
dangerous you know I was an abused kid

2661
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:39,159
and so you know I want repetition

2662
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:43,520
compulsion especially from a beautiful

2663
01:45:39,159 --> 01:45:47,000
woman and uh I I I have to say it that

2664
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:50,360
way I'll cry no really it's tragic but

2665
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,599
um but anyway here she is and then this

2666
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:54,520
doctor comes in and he's just looking

2667
01:45:52,599 --> 01:45:56,400
around he runs into her and she's got

2668
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:58,840
him in her tractor beam suddenly there's

2669
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:03,159
nothing he can do and I'm getting like

2670
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:06,840
really aroused you know and uh and all

2671
01:46:03,159 --> 01:46:09,800
of a sudden he pulls off he pushes her

2672
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:12,920
and holds on to her and she's all like

2673
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:15,800
dead bodied you know like rib cage and

2674
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:18,360
leather guts and justay everything and I

2675
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:19,400
was basically going you know why can't I

2676
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:21,880
meet

2677
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:24,199
that you know because I was so into

2678
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:26,639
monsters as you know I was turned off by

sure and uh monsters were like the thing

2681
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:33,000
that made me feel like I was alive

2682
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:35,639
inside feeling scared was better than

2683
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:40,360

2689
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,440
that I was surrounded by brilliant kids

[Applause]

2707
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:49,239
twice Robert B was my idol I had no

2708
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:51,639
blueprint for design I had no male role

2709
01:47:49,239 --> 01:47:54,040
models so to see this guy in a tuxedo

2710
01:47:51,639 --> 01:47:56,560
and a gunun and a go car and these

2711
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:59,280
beautiful European InterContinental

2712
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:01,960
women you know I said that that's kind

2713
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:04,199
of I wish I could be that that's that's

2714
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:08,280
my guy you know it was he was my dad

2715
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:09,800
yeah but uh yeah same reference points

2716
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:11,719
yeah from that time and now they're

2717
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,159
making a new man from Uncle movie saw

2718
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:14,840
that I don't know what to think about I

2719
01:48:13,159 --> 01:48:17,239
mean there's certain times where I was

2720
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:18,560
like I know what the Man from Uncle was

2721
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:20,320
even though I wasn't a big fan because

2722
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,400
it was before my time really but I like

2723
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:25,679
I know what it is and I've seen show of

2724
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:27,440
its time on television I'm just worrying

2725
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:29,080
like when you try to reboot something

2726
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,560
like that I mean is is a younger

2727
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:32,880
audience who they're obviously skewing

2728
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,280
it for even going to give a damn I mean

2729
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,800
they'll give a damn if it's flashy

2730
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:37,719
enough cuz to them it's brand new it's

2731
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,080
flashy enough yeah I mean is it

2732
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:40,599
basically going to be like the American

2733
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:42,199
Kingsmen is that what they're trying to

2734
01:48:40,599 --> 01:48:43,760
do because if they do that it might make

2735
01:48:42,199 --> 01:48:46,520
a ton of money sure that's what it looks

2736
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:48,599
like too well it's like the reboot of

2737
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:51,280
The Untouchables I mean same characters

2738
01:48:48,599 --> 01:48:53,840
but it was in no way like the 50s TV

2739
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:56,440
show which I also used to love yeah one

2740
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:58,800
of my favorite songs in the world was

2741
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:01,840
written by Nelson riddle and it's the

2742
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:04,320
themed to The Untouchables M that that

2743
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,840
big you know you can look at the album

2744
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,320
cover and they show all these shadowy

2745
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,599
figure in the dark big city looming and

2746
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:12,719
these guys had hats on and they were all

2747
01:49:10,599 --> 01:49:15,320
like looking around and you hear this

2748
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:17,159
big theme that portrays that like you

2749
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:19,480
know there's a lot of dangerous dudes

2750
01:49:17,159 --> 01:49:20,440
out there meanwhile they had no idea

2751
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:23,040
that in the

2752
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:25,679
future all the little angry dudes that

2753
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:28,800
are on the internet and and just roaming

2754
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:31,800
around out there angry angry or or make

2755
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,960
those guys look like gentlemen the truth

2756
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,000
you know what I mean they wouldn't kill

2757
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,320
anybody if it didn't have anything to do

2758
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,520
with your business right yeah yeah you

2759
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:41,080
know and now it's like you know

2760
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,719
demonstrating once again that man is the

2761
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:44,599
only animal that kills for the sheer

2762
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:48,119
enjoyment of it except the age group is

2763
01:49:44,599 --> 01:49:50,960
lowered yeah right I sound so gloom and

2764
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:53,000
doom no no I think I do I do have faith

01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,199
in a lot of things sure but it still

2766
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,800

2833
01:52:22,119 --> 01:52:27,000
same thing and I didn't notice the

2834
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:29,960
little various differences because he

2835
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,639

2836
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,639
person can think that way of course yeah

2891
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:01,599
about any other guy anywhere but I heard

2892
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:03,599
there was a kid on the other side of

2893
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:05,679
town that had comic books and I didn't

2910
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:44,040
Mad Magazine when I was doing the Stern

2911
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:48,079
Show they did a parody really on the

2912
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:49,800
Stern Show and I see me with this puppet

was so flattered I mean that stuff was

2917
01:55:56,440 --> 01:56:03,320
like Canon to me mhm it's amazing that

01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,199
is incredible be drawing in Mad Magazine

2919
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:07,920
but I mean my sense of humor was pretty

2920
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:09,320
much shaped on junk that I read in there

2921
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,280
yeah yeah yeah you know like there was a

2922
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:15,079
beautiful panel cartoon by a guy named

2923
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:18,480
Dave Berg yep and uh the Lighter Side

2924
01:56:15,079 --> 01:56:22,440
Lighter Side and so you know it talks

2925
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:24,960
about like um you know a woman will

2926
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:27,000
spend hours in the mirror before she

2927
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,040
goes on a DAT desperately trying to look

2928
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:32,920
sexy and when some imbecile responds to

2929
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:36,639
the stimulus it's like you pig you know

2930
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:39,119
but basic truths of life and guys you

2931
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:41,280
know it say uh you know there's always a

2932
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:44,400
good name for a drunk you know like

2933
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:46,719
Jolly Old Ed but it would always be fat

2934
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,719
old

2935
01:56:47,079 --> 01:56:53,400
Fanny yeah and that was the basic truth

2936
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:55,760
yeah yeah but it took mad to to like set

2937
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:59,560
you straight yeah it was so great I was

2938
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:01,800
an alder boy I knew the mass in Latin go

2939
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:03,400
figure you know and all of a sudden I

2940
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:05,840
said you know what I I spent all this

2941
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:07,239
time following these stories when I

2942
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:10,480
could have become a scholar of the

2943
01:57:07,239 --> 01:57:12,440
brothers Grim right you know what I mean

2944
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:13,920
and the thing is it kills me uh I

2945
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:16,000
probably know more about religion than

2946
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:19,040
most people and the stuff that I hear

2947
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:21,280
come out of people representing God oh

2948
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:22,639
it's the worst and and again it goes

2949
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,040
back like I was a religion major in

2950
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:27,119
college you were oh sure in what what

2951
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:28,760
what a comparative religion I was just I

2952
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:30,079
was into everything it's like oh what's

2953
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,079
this about what's this about how what's

2954
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:34,400
the difference between this and this

2955
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:35,599
right what the the branch devidians were

2956
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:39,040
big at that

2957
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:41,840
time Waco um yeah so faric so good um

2958
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:44,079
but yeah with with religion it's uh it's

2959
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:46,199
just the most fun ever and Carlin was

2960
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:48,119
one of the best people to talk about it

2961
01:57:46,199 --> 01:57:50,639
as far as comedy was concerned you know

2962
01:57:48,119 --> 01:57:52,960
it's just like you know like religion is

2963
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:54,840
nuts because you'll have this guy who's

2964
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:56,520
describing God you know he does that all

2965
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:58,719

01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:13,639
be describing you really no you know

2972
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:15,800
what I a real life situation I was

2973
01:58:13,639 --> 01:58:17,480
always questioning everything nothing

2974
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:21,480
made sense to me that's why I was more

2975
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:23,560
attracted to Fantasy and Whimsy and um

2976
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:25,960
you know picturesque picker esque

2977
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:27,599
whatever you know meaning silly and

2978
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:31,960
playful

2979
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:35,280
um because nothing made sense to me I

2980
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:36,960
was in parochial school and I I got out

2981
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:38,880
and I was like going to the bathroom in

2982
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,639
one of the rooms and and took a drink

2983
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,960
you know and there was real old oil

2984
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:45,239
paintings on the walls of these places I

2985
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,840
mean they were real old M and they were

2986
01:58:45,239 --> 01:58:49,679
oils some of them might be probably

2987
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:51,719
worth a fortune if you could go dig them

2988
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,920
up today sure but there was one of the

2989
01:58:51,719 --> 01:58:55,360
garden of

2990
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:58,520
Eden and they showed the apple and they

2991
01:58:55,360 --> 01:59:00,320
showed the serpent and Adam and Eve and

2992
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:01,520
I'm looking at it and I'm studying it

2993
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:05,920
and studying

2994
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:09,199

01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:45,520
know oh God and uh and I said well I'm

3009
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:48,320
just fascinated by it yeah why and I

3010
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:51,000
said well because there's some things

3011
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:52,760
that you know I mean I know the story

3012
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,599
and um

3013
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:57,760
you know God created Adam in His image

3014
01:59:56,599 --> 02:00:00,840
and

3015
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:02,960
likeness um and he took 100 pounds of

3016
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:05,440
clay from the earth and I'm I felt

3017
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:07,560
stupid saying these things because I

3018
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:09,239
never said them back to anyone it's like

3019
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,679
you're supposed to take that and pound

3020
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:13,000
that into your little skull and you

3021
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:14,119
better remember that buddy cuz there's

3022
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,520
going to be a

3023
02:00:14,119 --> 02:00:19,040
quiz you know and so I said 100 pounds

3024
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:22,719
of clay that's right you know and I like

3025
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:25,639
and then um he fashioned it into man in

3026
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:28,280
his own image and likeness that's right

3027
02:00:25,639 --> 02:00:30,119
and then he formed Eve from he God took

3028
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:32,520
a piece of Adam's Rib which became

3029
02:00:30,119 --> 02:00:36,000
personified somehow I didn't say that

3030
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:39,719
somehow you know from the clay to you

3031
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:42,719
know Prime and uh she said yes that's

3032
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:44,679
right informed Eve she said what so

3033
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:47,199
what's your point and I said why do they

3034
02:00:44,679 --> 02:00:47,199
have belly

3035
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:55,239
buttons woo woo woo the anger train

3036
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:55,239
coming at

3037
02:00:55,679 --> 02:01:02,400
me this angry teac Kettle skewing and

3038
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:04,560
screaming [ __ ] you know and it just it

3039
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:06,400
didn't make sense to me yeah cuz every

3040
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,679
painting I ever saw them they got nice

3041
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:10,800
little yeah not even the lousy ones that

3042
02:01:08,679 --> 02:01:12,079
get pulled out by a by an impatient

3043
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:16,079
doctor that's like yeah no no no just

3044
02:01:12,079 --> 02:01:18,760
nothing yeah just beautiful little innie

3045
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:20,480
M isn't that nice NOP makes perfect

3046
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:22,840
sense it's a great one this might have

3047
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:25,320
been painted 3 400 years ago yeah you

3048
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:28,440
just and they didn't even figure it

3049
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:33,239
out but some stupid kid in Detroit going

3050
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:35,520
to parochial school you know oh that kid

3051
02:01:33,239 --> 02:01:36,760
nothing ever changes yeah it's the same

3052
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,520
thing you know I got to watch what I do

3053
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:39,840
like in front of housekeepers and stuff

3054
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:42,800
because if you piss them off they'll

3055
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:44,480
write a book about you now it is now you

3056
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:46,920
don't even need to do that no but I mean

3057
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:48,480
your camera in the corner I think of my

3058
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:49,760
housekeeper you know if I ever did

3059
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:51,960
anything wrong next thing you know

3060
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:55,920
there'd be a book there always is MHM

3061
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:55,920
and it would be called oh

3062
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:06,239
B I like how do you spell that you

3063
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:08,239
know there probably uh how it sounds

3064
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:10,960
it's it's got that um well it's not

3065
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:13,639
castillan because there's no in it

3066
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,400
exactly okay it's like through closed

3067
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:18,760
teeth that's

3068
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:21,480
disapproval yeah because um I knew some

3069
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:23,159
uh a Puerto Rican family and one of the

3070
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:27,520
daughters was drinking a little too much

3071
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:30,280
coito at Christmas time and uh coito is

3072
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:31,679
like heavy duty M and U the mother's

3073
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:34,159
sitting there and she's watching

okay okay and it's just like I I love

3077

3078
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:49,320
yeah it's the rich Buffet you know

3079
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:51,239
that's the best of Life lingo people's

3080
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:53,000
attitudes and everything he served me

3081
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:55,679
well you know like I said why did they

3082
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,719
even bother going to school you know I

3083
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,159
did go one year at Berkeley College of

3084
02:02:57,719 --> 02:03:01,760
Music but it wasn't even a college then

3085
02:02:59,159 --> 02:03:03,000
it was a school of music oh before it

3086
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,840
was even part of college right oh

3087
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,119
interesting yeah it was a school MH and

3088
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,560
uh I couldn't wait to get out of there I

3089
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:10,800
wanted to be playing music I wanted to

3090
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:13,920
be on the road you know I didn't want to

3091
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,920
talk about it sure but then look at that

3092
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:17,560
I was smart there too because all the

3093
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:19,119
people who make hit records all the

3094
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:20,679
rappers you know they start out taking

3095
02:03:19,119 --> 02:03:23,480
their award and they go I like to thank

3096
02:03:20,679 --> 02:03:26,679
God and God is a going don't pin that

3097
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:28,679
[ __ ] on me don't thank me for that I

3098
02:03:26,679 --> 02:03:30,239
took that day off I went fishing I don't

3099
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:31,800
know who you're talking about I don't

3100
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:33,440
have anything to do with this yeah right

3101
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:35,119
I could see it every year you know oh

3102
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:37,760
gez it means I got to go to you know

3103
02:03:35,119 --> 02:03:39,239
another galaxy or something and hang out

3104
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:43,079
with people that are

3105
02:03:39,239 --> 02:03:45,079
intelligent um and uh you know it's like

3106
02:03:43,079 --> 02:03:46,960
they don't even know what a gcff is or a

3107
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:49,719
treble cleff and it's it's like that's

3108
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:52,559
the highest award you can win in music

3109
02:03:49,719 --> 02:03:55,520
mhm and so I'm glad I didn't spend any

3110
02:03:52,559 --> 02:03:57,320
waste any [ __ ] time at the Berkeley

3111
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:59,880
right yeah and I went out and I made a

3112
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:01,599
living as a musician you I wanted to be

3113
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:05,719
like the best guitar player in the world

3114
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:07,159
sure sang mhm but we didn't have uh we

3115
02:04:05,719 --> 02:04:09,320
didn't have Ries that they just didn't

3116
02:04:07,159 --> 02:04:12,119
exist you got to do it all yourself no

3117
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:17,360
this was like the mid to late

3118
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:19,000
60s early 70s and you broke a string you

3119
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:21,280
to sit there either sit there like a

3120
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,440
fried egg till till you figure out how

3121
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:26,880
to change it or I would launch into

3122
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:28,360
voices and noises and all that stuff and

3123
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:30,440
it became apparent to me that sometimes

3124
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:31,960
the people liked that better than they

3125
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:33,320
like the music I mean when they were

3126
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:36,400
plotting for us they were plotting for

3127
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:38,119
the Rolling Stones or or whoever was out

3128
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:41,559
there at the time cuz we were doing

3129
02:04:38,119 --> 02:04:43,639
covers but you added character by just

3130
02:04:41,559 --> 02:04:45,400
but I I just thought it was illegitimate

3131
02:04:43,639 --> 02:04:47,559
compared to music you know that's how

3132
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:49,960
clueless I was yeah yeah yeah I mean it

3133
02:04:47,559 --> 02:04:52,679
makes sense I I had no idea that that

3134
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:55,119
was something that was viable right and

3135
02:04:52,679 --> 02:04:57,440
that I would actually go on in life to

3136
02:04:55,119 --> 02:05:00,199
make a living at it yeah I didn't go to

3137
02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:01,840
be famous I didn't go to be rich I I

3138
02:05:00,199 --> 02:05:04,639
never thought for a million years that

3139
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:06,280
you could ever achieve that yeah I was

3140
02:05:04,639 --> 02:05:09,440
just bursting to bring something to

3141
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:12,119
table mhm and and all of it is a result

3142
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:14,400
of the albums we're talking about the TV

3143
02:05:12,119 --> 02:05:17,400
shows and

3144
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:19,440
um is there if you I consider myself

3145
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:21,159
extremely fortunate you talk to anybody

3146
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,199
Tom canny we talk about this all the

3147
02:05:21,159 --> 02:05:24,599
time how

3148
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:25,960
how grateful how much gratitude we have

3149
02:05:24,599 --> 02:05:29,159
because the odds of this are a billion

3150
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:31,800
to one and I know it yeah and uh that

3151
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:34,760
we're able to continue working and then

3152
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:37,159
I haven't had a break from working for

3153
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:38,840
30 years yeah you know and there's not a

3154
02:05:37,159 --> 02:05:40,679
lot of people that can say that that's

3155
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:42,760
why all these schlub celebrities want to

3156
02:05:40,679 --> 02:05:44,599
do what I do for a living of course of

3157
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:47,840
course you know because they want to

3158
02:05:44,599 --> 02:05:50,239
keep being relevant right and so they

3159
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:52,280
have no problem with their anemic voices

3160
02:05:50,239 --> 02:05:53,960
you know being used for cartoon they're

3161
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:56,559
just who and exactly what they are I

3162
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:57,960
wish I had that Liberty right life would

3163
02:05:56,559 --> 02:05:59,800
be so much easier if I could just go

3164
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:01,760
down and be Billy West for anything you

3165
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:04,440
know talking toilet or a bottle of

3166
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:05,679
bleach what's wrong with my nasy flawed

3167
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:08,599
plain

3168
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:11,079
vanilla that's that's like Bel LA or

3169
02:06:08,599 --> 02:06:12,599
drags like a you know a cart with three

3170
02:06:11,079 --> 02:06:14,000
wheels that's the funny thing like

3171
02:06:12,599 --> 02:06:16,159
you're sailable because you're

3172
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,639
recognizable as a star whereas you got

3173
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:20,320
to be a chameleon and that's the [ __ ]

3174
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:21,920
Talent of it and also it's I would I

3175
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:23,760
would much rather as a fan of all the

3176
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:25,760
stuff I would much rather pick people

3177
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,760
out well it's not even pick people out I

3178
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:30,360
would rather have somebody whose voice

3179
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:32,440
is suited to the character as opposed to

3180
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:33,920
somebody who wants name recognition

3181
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:35,960
which has nothing to do with the product

3182
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,360
that they're trying to sell you know

3183
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:40,760
like let Batman be Batman or or

3184
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:42,880
Daredevil or whichever car Invader Zim

3185
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:45,559
or whoever it is I did the pilot for

3186
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:47,040
Invader Zim I know I love somebody was

3187
02:06:45,559 --> 02:06:49,119
talking about it I didn't think anyone

3188
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:50,960
could possibly even remember or know

3189
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:52,679
that oh yeah well I mean the the guy who

3190
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,840
drew it used to do this comic book

3191
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:56,760
called Johnny the homicidal maniac which

3192
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:58,199
I was a big fan of so when he went over

3193
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:59,440
the animation I was like oh gotta go

3194
02:06:58,199 --> 02:07:01,040
check that out wait who did the rest of

3195
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:03,280
the series my brain is just totally shut

3196
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:07,079
off though uh you mean who actually well

3197
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:09,280
there was that kid um Jon and Vasquez MH

3198
02:07:07,079 --> 02:07:12,480
mhm he didn't want me to be Invader Zim

3199
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:13,760
after I did the pilot because uh he said

3200
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:16,440
that uh I was

3201
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,400
Overexposed how dare this little son of

3202
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:20,920
a [ __ ] who hasn't proven a thing say

3203
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:22,679
I'm overex and I realized you know what

3204
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:26,400
he's right

3205
02:07:22,679 --> 02:07:29,159
so my friend intensely incredibly genius

3206
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:31,599
talented Richie Horwitz did it and his

3207
02:07:29,159 --> 02:07:33,719
interpretation was gold to me I was

3208
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:35,440
thrilled to death you know great yeah I

3209
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:36,719
mean I would much rather hear people who

3210
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,360
know what they're doing and embody the

3211
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:40,360
character but I love people

3212
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,760
automatically assume that there's a feud

3213
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:44,960
attached to everything so so what

3214
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:46,360
happened when how did you feel right

3215
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:48,840
right right did this it's like what that

3216
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:50,840
one of my best friends got a job yeah

3217
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:53,480
it's fine believe me yeah I don't give a

3218
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:56,000
dismal damn who gets what you know I

3219
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:57,440
don't covet something yeah when someone

3220
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,880
else is doing it go I could have got

3221
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:02,199
that do you know how prevalent that is

3222
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:04,400
in 100% I could have that could have

3223
02:08:02,199 --> 02:08:05,960
been mine I could have done it of course

3224
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:07,480
anyone could have done it you like

3225
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:08,880
Spencer Tracy said acting is the easiest

3226
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:11,440
thing in the world know your lines don't

3227
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:15,159
bump into the furniture yeah yeah boom

3228
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:16,800
and be able to uh fake sincerity yeah

3229
02:08:15,159 --> 02:08:19,079
that help 100% because when you can fake

3230
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:22,000
that you can just fake

3231
02:08:19,079 --> 02:08:24,440
anything if uh that ain't the quote and

3232
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,000
and I wish I hadn't tried to steal

3233
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:28,320
it we towards the end we like to always

3234
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,320
have people if you're going to recommend

3235
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:31,520
this album to somebody let's say because

3236
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,840
some of our audience I'm hoping are

3237
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:34,679
younger people who don't know [ __ ] about

3238
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:35,840
comedy that's fine that's what I like so

3239
02:08:34,679 --> 02:08:37,800
let's say they haven't heard of Jonathan

3240
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:38,880
Winters or don't know him from anything

3241
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:40,199
well saying they don't know [ __ ] about

3242
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:43,040
comedy is lit

3243
02:08:40,199 --> 02:08:45,079
antagonistic you got to them a littleit

3244
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,920
I'm trying to do when I was like five

3245
02:08:45,079 --> 02:08:47,480
I'm hoping there were a lot of

3246
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:50,000
5-year-olds listening to this I didn't

3247
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:52,040
know me too especially after some of the

3248
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:56,520
subject matter that was

3249
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:57,880
by my brain my evil side uh so what we

3250
02:08:56,520 --> 02:09:00,440
like to tell them like if you're going

3251
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:02,840
to recommend this album to them having

3252
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:04,320
never heard Jonathan Winters what's

3253
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:05,679
what's a good way to condense why this

3254
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:07,400
album's good to listen

3255
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:11,000
to

3256
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:13,119
um not that it would matter to a lot of

3257
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,719
people but this is a man that could come

3258
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:18,840
out in front of a bunch of people he had

3259
02:09:15,719 --> 02:09:22,840
no instrument he had no Loops he had no

3260
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:25,119
beats he had nothing and Magic emanated

3261
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:27,239
from him because of his brain firing

3262
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:30,000
synapses in a magical way and that's

3263
02:09:27,239 --> 02:09:31,520
what he has magic it's very intimidating

3264
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,040
when you're up close and personal to

3265
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:35,480
someone who has true magic yeah it makes

3266
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:37,480
you like you don't know whether to [ __ ]

3267
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:39,639
or go blind it was like my friends you

3268
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:42,880
know yeah growing up they they don't

3269
02:09:39,639 --> 02:09:44,559
have magic and you did yeah and it's

3270
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:47,639
your fault you know and suddenly that's

3271
02:09:44,559 --> 02:09:50,599
you're not to be spoken to or you know

3272
02:09:47,639 --> 02:09:52,280
but if you do want to see that there's

3273
02:09:50,599 --> 02:09:55,079
lots of places you can see that watch a

3274
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:58,480
guy like hitz you know go on YouTube and

3275
02:09:55,079 --> 02:10:01,320
watch a man with a piece of wood cat gut

3276
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:04,679
a bow you know some strings on it and

3277
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:06,920
and create Magic with an instrument no

3278
02:10:04,679 --> 02:10:09,239
special effects no nothing no

3279
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:12,079
pre-programming no touch of a button

3280
02:10:09,239 --> 02:10:14,000
anything this is a human being yeah

3281
02:10:12,079 --> 02:10:16,960
that's if you want to see that and you

3282
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,480
can deal with that you know that's where

3283
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:21,960
you'll that's where that's something

3284
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:23,840
that'll you know just uh set your hair

3285
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,520
on fire I mean you can't you can't go

3286
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:27,199
back to the other stuff you know it's

3287
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:29,520
like it's like you've looked over the

3288
02:10:27,199 --> 02:10:32,880
fence and I'm like this guy is a

3289
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:35,840
comedian like how do I go back to you

3290
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:37,760
know Dane Cook when I've seen this you

3291
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:40,280
know it's like I mean and Dane Cook is a

3292
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:43,119
lovely man I'm sure I don't know him

3293
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:46,000
anyway but I mean like and and I love

3294
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:47,840
would that be like a Danish epicurian

3295
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:51,840
Chef or something yes that's what he

3296
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:55,400
meant yes a a Danish Chef exactly yes

3297
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:59,920
um not as funny as the Swedish Chef but

3298
02:10:55,400 --> 02:11:01,320
funny more laughing on the inside Chef

3299
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:03,719
no but but that's just it and like one

3300
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:06,000
of the things I love about uh Jonathan

3301
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:08,960
Winters is like you can see it's a mad

3302
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,400
mad mad mad mad world and see a a little

3303
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:13,800
bit of that but it's a scripted film and

3304
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:16,520
he had to stay very much on the rails

3305
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,639
you know they let him you know of course

3306
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:19,360
I mean especially when you see him doing

3307
02:11:17,639 --> 02:11:20,920
physical bits like when he's on the bike

3308
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:24,040
and you know you're just literally like

3309
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:27,559
how is managing to stay up but when you

3310
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:30,480
see him on The Tonight Show or you see

3311
02:11:27,559 --> 02:11:32,840
any of those clips where you know when

3312
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:34,199
it is totally different when he steps

3313
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:36,840
out from that couch or even when he's

3314
02:11:34,199 --> 02:11:38,840
still sitting on the couch the look on

3315
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:40,760
Johnny's face or whoever it is is

3316
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:43,400
totally different when Winters is going

3317
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:45,480
than any other comedian there is there

3318
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:47,840
is almost it's like watching somebody

3319
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:50,400
getting ready to jump out of a plane

3320
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:52,440
it's like something wholly unexpected is

3321
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:55,199
going to happen and we all got to be

3322
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:57,480
it's like looking at a burn victim you I

3323
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:59,880
I can't I shouldn't but I must but I

3324
02:11:57,480 --> 02:12:02,000
have to I I cannot look away but look at

3325
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:03,440
how interesting this is so we've just

3326
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,559
compared Jonathan Winters with a burn

3327
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:08,000
victim jumping out of a plane

3328
02:12:05,559 --> 02:12:10,800
that's okay I just wanted to make sure

3329
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,800
Define burn victim yes Define airplane I

3330
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:16,719
I leave I leave it up to both of you

3331
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:18,880

pure love first and foremost and had to

3355
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:15,800

3547
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:22,600
well we always end the podcast by saying

3548
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:24,280

3549
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:25,560
what if I said have a good brain thing

3550
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:26,359

02:20:26,359 --> 02:20:30,560

[ __ ] up no I would never do that okay

3555
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,359
but it's but it's my option and my

3556
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:40,120
decision whether I decide if I let you
