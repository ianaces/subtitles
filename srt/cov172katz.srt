7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,439
what's your favorite number my favorite

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,040
number that's a very good question uh

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,760
h no that's a stupid question let me let

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,399
me ask question any number if it's got a

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,960
seven in it yeah M let me ask you a

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,480
better question

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,920
yes um you have to guess I'm I'm going

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,480
to think of a number between one and 10

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,239
and you have to guess if I'm really

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,000
thinking of a number between 1 and 10 or

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,480
if I'm just pretending that I'm thinking

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,480
a of a number between one and

19
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,879
10 okay so I bet I bet let you on the

you for inviting me what a pleas so you

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
picked this album And while I might be

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,600
Loosely familiar with Burns and triber

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,479
i' had never heard this album which by

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,040
the way very short album unexpectedly

37
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,399
short yeah uh less than 25 minutes I

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,479
think uh really yeah and I I was I was

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,600
actually quite shocked uh it's got a

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,320
great cover uh because it's it's it's

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,119
the cab driver uh sketch on the

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,039
cover I think that's the routine with

43
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,840
which they're most associated is the

44
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,840
right right

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,479
it and it's it's a great bit it's a long

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,039
both basically the album is two bits

47
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,759
except for the make a song at the very

48
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,720
end it's the cab driver and the

49
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,280
conventioneer on one side one whole side

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,640
is a 13-minute track where did you first

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,519
hear this

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,680
album I think it was um you know I was

53
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,680
into comedy with through my my cousin

54
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,760
Paul and I were got into comedy together

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:35,000
Lenny Bruce and burns and Tre ber uh and

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:40,760
then my sister introduced me to music

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,959
musical comedy like uh Tom L sure

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,080
um but Burns and triber also the first

59
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,280
time I ever got on stage was in New York

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,120
City at a club called hillies uhhuh

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,800
where I think you know was in the West

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,760
Village in New York and David mammo and

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,080
I got on stage and tried to do burns and

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,319
triber cuz we didn't have any mat of our

65
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,000
own and we lasted about 30

66
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,400
seconds 30 seconds before you realize

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,799
you couldn't do it anymore 30 seconds

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,319
before they booed you off stage no I

69
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,959
think I I think David probably could

70
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,080
have gone a minute M cuz he was better

71
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,680
better prepared than me but I as as soon

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,159
as I realized that I had to remember

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,480
stuff right I was

74
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,799
done what were you try did you try and

75
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,400
do this bit do you remember the bit you

76
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,840
triying to do I think we tried to do the

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:39,040
Cap taxi

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,799
cap um but uh the re the one of the

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,840
reasons I love them in retrospect is

80
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,000
that they cut each other

81
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,560
off that I'm sure they

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
were they had a real I doubt that they

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,480
work with the script but they but they

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,720
were such an amazing team sure yeah and

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,400
um I think the

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,480
the track that I really fell in love

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,480
with was the one about the faith healer

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,159
because so many comedians have done that

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,599
including Robin Williams yeah and I

90
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,799
don't think anyone's done it this well

91
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,280
right yeah and it's uh it's layered uh

92
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,360
to say the least and the idea that I

93
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,520
mean you you talk about uh be I mean I

94
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,080
it seems like something it's so

95
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,680
conversational that you would think yeah

96
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,960
sure I could memorize this and do it

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,759
I've got this in my head and then I

98
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,400
think the second you realize how comp

99
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,440
complex this is even if it's born out of

100
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,600
improv how complex this is is kind of

101
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,639
overwhelming but you could Jason you

102
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,720
could call up right now my cousin Paul

103
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,600
and David mammed and asked them to make

104
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,800
the sound of the Communist

105
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,759
frog and both of them would say boodoo

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,039
relap my

107
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,440
friends it's just such an insane

108
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,280
sound and the idea that there were

109
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,759
communist frogs living in was it

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
supposed to be happening in Florida I

111
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,440
think that's I think so yeah yeah

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,400
yeah um so I guess they

113
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:12,840
were this was set in a time when it was

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:16,560
not very hi hip to be a communist

115
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:21,880
right and oddly not both of my parents

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,680
were really yeah my parents were both uh

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,759
subpoenaed by the house on American

118
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
Activities

119
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:32,160
Committee and they both both pled the

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,720
fifth that is more than upsetting so so

121
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,160
I I mean neither of them believed in the

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,160
Communist

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:47,240
frog but um yeah so it means means a lot

124
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,680
to me on a bunch of different levels but

125
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,600
mostly comedically is so

126
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,639
funny is there uh so I'm guessing I'm

127
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,199
guessing Jason that this is this is

128
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,039
going to be interp interspersed with

129
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,840
some of the the album itself yeah I

130
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,520
normally uh throughout the episode every

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,000
10 minutes or so I'll throw a clip of 30

132
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,120
seconds to a minute in so that people

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
can get an idea of what we're talking

134
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,599
about including like you know esec

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,880
especially if there's a specific beat or

136
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,000
a specific uh you know character moment

137
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,240
that that you like I always like to

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,759
point that out to people so they can

139
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,360
hear what you're talking

140
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,360
about uh I think the one thing that that

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,680
that stood out uh or at least is is in

142
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,360
my memory is the one thing that my

143
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,520
mother always used to quote which was

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,680
just the you know the yeah you know the

145
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,160
cutting off of one another just as a bit

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,160
just that that was in that that could be

147
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,919
a bit is kind of kind of wonderful and

148
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,520
you definitely see a little a lot of um

149
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,960
makes me think of just about anything

150
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,720
that uh Christopher gueston and and uh

151
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,240
Billy Crystal did on SNL they they they

152
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,520
really took a lot from this which is

153
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
fine but uh right you can you can hear

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,560
that influence pretty clearly

155
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,360
too yeah and also they were based in

156
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,840
Chicago I think they Jack Burns and a sh

157
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,879
right think that they came out of Second

158
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:09,720
City yes that's right um so you know I

159
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,639
was also around the time listening to

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Nicholls and may sure

161
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,919
um uh

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,960
Jerry Stiller and an

163
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,879
Mira and I got to work with Jerry

164
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,400
Stiller I made a movie with him that's a

165
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,479
that's see that's amazing a wonderful

166
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,199
movie called The Independent where

167
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,960
Janine garao was my love interest

168
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,960
although she would say it was just a bad

169
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,599
date that's fantastic that you should

170
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,639
try to see that movie if you ever can

171
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:48,520
because it's he portrays a guy who made

172
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:51,599
really bad movies ah and knew

173
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,879
it and he and somebody offered to buy

174
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,120
his entire entire catalog and pay him by

175
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,120
the

176
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,199
pound um

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,120
and you could see a scene from that on

178
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,319
my website I'm I'm going to have to look

179
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,039
that up I'm surprised I haven't seen it

180
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,400
um I there there's a point where I

181
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,319
watched everything Janine Garo was in uh

182
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,000
so I'm surprised I haven't seen it

183
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,840
um is you know that is the the cab

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,720
driver I'm sure I've heard it before but

185
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,919
I had never obviously heard the entire

186
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,759
thing do you is is there something

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,639
specific not necessarily about this bit

188
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,120
but about this album that made you pick

189
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,520
it was I mean how how many how many

190
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,879
albums did you listen to before you

191
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,879
heard

192
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,760
this I want an exact number yeah

193
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,959
43 um what kind of stuff were you

194
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,399
listening to before did this change the

195
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,560
kind of Comedy you listen to or was this

196
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,880
the kind of stuff you were listening to

197
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,680
at the time I think Lenny Bruce was the

198
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,720
first comedy album I listened to L Lenny

199
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,320
Bruce live at Carnegie H some people

200
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,240
think it's one of his worst but I I

201
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,959
happen to love it and um

202
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,959
and then I guess I don't think I had

203
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,480
discovered Woody Allen at that

204
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,320
point

205
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,880
um but and then it's a kid I listen to

206
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,200
funny songs the songs that my sister

207
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,720
thought was funny like there was a song

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,360
about the railroad goes to the middle of

209
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:28,800
my house which you probably don't know I

210
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,800
do not know that one yeah and um

211
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:38,320
I guess jeez

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,320
I you know I was a kid in the 50s

213
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,959
mhm

214
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,160
and you I was listening to a podcast

215
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,640
with do your podcast with Dr Demento who

216
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,399
I think is a little bit older than me

217
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,399
uhhuh

218
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,720
yeah but I did recognize some of his

219
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,959
references sure scares

220
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,279
me um well I mean Spike Jones you you

221
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,920
there was a good 20 25 year period where

222
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,519
you couldn't not know who he was and

223
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,519
then oddly fell off the map for the rest

224
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,519
of us I was aware of him I I was trying

225
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,800
to convince my wife that she would love

226
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,680
Spike Jones that was not a

227
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,560
success she does love me however well

228
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,160

them down during Passover why we do not

253
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,760
know that's it he is I wouldn't

254
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,440
necessarily say an acquired taste but a

255
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,680
taste for a certain type of mind I do

256
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,720
think you have to be either a comedy

257
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,040
lover or of the period or both in order

258
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,200
to appreciate it maybe I I could be

259
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,800
wrong I could be wrong but that's what

260
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,560
it felt like to me because it took me a

261
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,839
second to to get into what it was and

262
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,720
and to understand them but you know

263
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,480
that's that's kind of what I but this

264
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,920
this guy that I introduced you to Jeff

265
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,720
martyr is that his name yes I believe so

266
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,680
he also when I when I did stand up with

267
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,200
him on the

268
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,200
road anytime we had any time off he

269
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,600
would go looking for flea markets that

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,800
sell with old I guess they weren't that

271
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:02,680
old at the time well in the 80s 33s were

272
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:07,639
pretty uh scarce of Comedy

273
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:10,200
right and I I found Woody Woodbury which

274
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,560
I tried to listen to and I couldn't and

275
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,800
then I heard Phil is it Phil Kendry or

276
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,160
Henry Phil Henry yeah he said he was

277
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,279
talking about how wonderful he was yeah

278
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,639
it's it's such a it's such a mixed bag

279
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,279
when you when you interview people the

280
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,839
kind of stuff that they're going to love

281
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,440
and not I mean uh that's why I'm not a I

282
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,920
used to be a real big snob about

283
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,959
highbrow and low brow and then sort of

284
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,959
realize that that doesn't really that's

285
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,600
a useless definition at least for me it

286
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,399
doesn't help anymore I did discover

287
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,639
through your podcast that I have so much

288
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,399
in common with that guy with Phil hry

289
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,480
yeah oh he's wonderful just in terms of

290
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:49,240
a really loving audio

291
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,760
and comedy and but I was amazed to hear

292
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,920
that he does his podcast in real time

293
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,279
and he does all all the voices himself

294
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,720
with no editing It's upsetting and and

295
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,440
to watch him do it cuz you can watch him

296
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,000
do it online just the speed with which

297
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,880
he does it the fluidity with which he

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,199
does it the seeming ease but obviously

299
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,959
you know there's there's no way that uh

300
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,320
there's no way it's not complex for him

301
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,920
still but just it does not seem to be

302
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,959
and it's it's good God and that it's all

303
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,160
improvised I don't know how he does it

304
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,519
at all

305
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,920
yeah hey Jason do you do any accents

336
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,959
it's it you don't find a lot of Upstate

337
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,600
names in in the comedy world at least

338

343
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,920
back to Burns and Trev too easily

344
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,440
distracted

345
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,440
um I'm trying to

346
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,800
remember I think oh uh they on Columbia

347
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,320
Records this one that I'm looking at is

348
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,399
a Colombia record yes this one is that's

349
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,000
how it happened because my uncle my

350
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,920
cousin Paul's father was an art director

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,600
at Columbia really and he would bring

352
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:28,360
home uh real TOS of Nat King

353
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,160
Cole and uh he did the artwork for Dylan

354
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,040
wow and brought home the burns and

355
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,360
triber album one

356
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,040
day and he found me he loved me but he

357
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,240
found me so

358
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,560
annoying

359
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,800
um and and the fact that my cousin Paul

360
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,920
and I were borrowing his real toore tape

361
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,639
recorder just to Pretend We're Burns and

362
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,360
triber drove him

363
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,720
nuts and we also recorded scenes from

364
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,720
Mad

365
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Magazine that's fantastic yeah I had my

366
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,759
whole life on audio which is just in

367
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,959
case you ever want to know what I

368
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,079
sounded like as when I was eight can I

369
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,440
tell you I I absolutely do and I'm the

370
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,000
exact same way uh I've been doing these

371
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,199
same things since I was a I have an

372
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,800
entire podcast dedicated to sketches I

373
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,600
was doing when I was 13 with my best

374
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,680
friend really yeah we have like 50 VHS

375
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,199
tapes worth of garbage that we thought

376
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,160
was really funny at 13 yeah had your

377
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,920
voice changed not much a little bit Yeah

378
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,920
considerably

379
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,759
yeah I I think I I mean it's a different

380
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,600
kind of be of hoarding but it's if you

381
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,240
archive it online it's not so bad yeah I

382
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,440
know I it feels like it has more of a

383
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
purpose because you know nobody has to

384
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,279
come see your crap but they can if they

385
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,279
want yeah and also I think the sound of

386
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:56,639
someone's voice means more than their

387
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:59,040
image to me do you think it uh

388
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,240
emotionally or what yeah no emotionally

389
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,439
I think it's more

390
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,959
potent in in fact I I spent a year of my

391
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,520
life trying to find the sound of my

392
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,640
mother's

393
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,880
voice and that Journey ended up on this

394
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,439
American life that's amazing so going

395
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,319
through all of your old tapes just to

396
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,839
hear her somewhere yeah directly on mic

397
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,880
or in the

398
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,079
background and no it was just you know

399
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,640
she would play the piano and I play the

400
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,039
violin and whenever somebody called her

401
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,039
home they always thought she was Mr cats

402
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,559
she was a smoker uhhuh

403
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,320
um but she died when when I was very

404
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,760
young and so for me it meant a great

405
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,280
deal to hear her voice oddly enough the

406
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,840
pach that Ira

407
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,360
gled was more about my sister and I

408
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,840
going back to our homes in Brooklyn mhm

409
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
he was not interested in my mother's

410
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,520
voice at

411
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,159
all so how how much is of that whole

412
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,960
piece is in there any of it

413
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,679
uh nun

414
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,720
none that's too bad that's do you have

415
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,120
that posted online somewhere I hope that

416
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:15,720
that's on in the um This American Life

417
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:18,919
archives oh okay was called for a return

418
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,280
to Childhood it was a segment in

419
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:25,840
that and it was it was at least 10 years

420
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,840
ago or eight years ago

421
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,400
mhm I mean having these that's that's I

422
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,840
mean that's one of the purposes of this

423
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,720
show too I mean obviously we don't get

424
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,440
to there aren't LPS of uh too many

425
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,679
comedians when they were eight to when

426
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,640
they were you know in their 50s 60s 70s

427
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,200
' 80s but there is it it always means

428
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,000
something to us at the time is there

429
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,159
something that this correlates with in

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,320
your life or I mean I could be jumping

431
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,799
to conclusions there but is there

432
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,720
anything that this reminds you of is it

433
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
remind you of uh getting on stage with

434
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
David mammo or does it remind you of

435
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,760
being a a you know just your friendship

436
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,480
as a

437
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:07,520
kid you talking about Burns and triber

438
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,480
mhm yeah it does it does remind me of my

439
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:16,919
connection to my uncle Abe my cousin

440
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:20,440
Paul to David to Comedy um and I think

441
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,679
even to Dr Katz because one of the

442
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,520
things about Dr Katz which was fun was

443
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,360
that we were allowed to interrupt each

444
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,720
other yeah you know no there was no no

445
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,720
uh

446
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:41,200
no conceit to manners you know it's just

447
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,640
totally people talking over each other

448
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,919
and occasionally stop you would stop

449
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,520
talking talking because you were

450
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,520
laughing so

451
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,400
hard

452
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
um

453
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,320
but yeah I'm sorry

454
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm I apologize for the silence I know

455
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,280
it doesn't play well no it's okay I mean

456
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,880
you're thinking I mean I I hope people

457
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,679
understand that what I'm I I actually

458
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,480
Panic whenever I pause on this show and

459
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,919
I just try and cover it with speaking

460
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,240
and then forget what I was talking about

461
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,400
so worry not do you do you edit the

462
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,200
audio yourself I do I do I don't edit a

463
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,320
whole lot uh unless there's something

464
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,720
where somebody really doesn't want

465
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,200
something in there so if you know if any

466
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,720
racial epithets come out of either one

467
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,039
of us I'll try and cut them out yeah are

468
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,520
are you married I am uh if if you could

469
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,919

with a German German accent no no I'm

481
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,880
kidding I'm asking too much of

482
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,919
you you know the reason I'm asking about

483
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,360
these accents is because in in my next

484
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,919
podcast I'm going to portray a guy that

485
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,080
has a voiceover agency uhhuh so this is

486
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,559
going to come in very handy was the

487
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,559
blood of a

488
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,960
lamb that's that's we don't do it it

506
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,919
money in the pot there in the way out

move along Move Along there

508
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,440
son I'll tell you that bugs me when that

509
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,440
happens

510
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,679
I come on Lord shape up I feel like when

511
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,960
I first watched Dr cats to me the idea

512
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,960
of uh uh stepping on one another's lines

513
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,240
and apparent improv seemed obviously

514
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,039
groundbreaking to me cuz I'd never

515
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,159
really heard that before it's it's it's

516
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,679
good to know know where obviously at

517
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,559
this point having gone to college and

518
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,880
done some studying myself I know that

519
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,640
while your show didn't invent it it

520
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,480
certainly perfected it at the time for

521
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,919
me it's it's great to listen to that oh

522
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,840
no this is kind of where it came from

523
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,279
for you I love I love having that like I

524
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,240
had Billy West on the show a couple

525
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,080
weeks ago that that podcast hasn't aired

526
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,039
yet and he he told me about oh yeah well

527
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,159
you know this not just the three stoes

528
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,000
were the source of uh Ren and Stimpy but

529
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,200
this particular Three Stooges little

530
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,679
yellow plastic album was the the root

531
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,159
for it that's where I discovered it

532
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,039
those little bits and pieces those are

533
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
what's kind of fun to

534
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,360
discover now you're not old enough to

535
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,480
know about going into

536
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,360
a into a little booth and it sounds like

537
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,039
it could go very dark the story but go

538
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,600
going into a little booth in Grand

539
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,440
Central Station and recording your

540
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,400
voice that is something that they still

541
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,919
exist in a few places just you know for

542
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,480
hipsters but uh yeah I've always

543
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,960
regretted that I didn't live in a period

544
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,000
of time when I could just

545
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,440
go to a booth and pay a couple bucks and

546
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,600
yeah

547
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,679
H I'm I'm assuming you have one you must

548
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,279
have one that you recorded or more uh

549
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,600
I'm looking around the room I don't but

550
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:47,200
I have so many forms of of audio

551
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,720
recording that are obsolete M I have a

552
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,080
machine called the El cassette recorder

553
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,440
uhhuh and that's a format that did not

554
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
catch

555
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,159
on what is different from the cassette I

556
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,279
would think of it's much bigger than

557
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,679
much bigger

558
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,200
it's

559
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,400
it's like it was a step it was like

560
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,320
trying to go from the cassette to the

561
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,520
real toore with an extra step oh boy

562
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,080
that was the El

563
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,400
cassette I but I I kind of I've almost

564
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,760
bought a few of those old not

565
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
necessarily that but I've I've almost

566
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,880
bought an Edison uh you know a cylinder

567
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,120
recorder I I I held back because it was

568
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,480
expensive uh and then an Edison wire

569
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,640
recorder which would have sounded like

570
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,799
garbage but still would have been

571
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,000
fascinating oh my God that that would be

572
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:34,039
amazing to own that I know I almost and

573
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,880
I pretty sure it was at an estate sale I

574
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,840
would have gotten it for less than $50

575
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,080
and it still had you know unused you

576
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,760
know G yeah I and I love that stuff I

577
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,039
don't know why I I couldn't I couldn't

578
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,880
begin to tell you why but it's just

579
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:49,720
fascinating to

580
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:52,360
me well I have all these still photos of

581
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,399
movie of movie studios and the thing I

582
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,880
like the most is looking at the audio

583
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:58,760
equipment that they

584
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,440
used and there's also photos of Ginger

585
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,960
Rogers and Fred the stair which is cool

586
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,159
but I I go with the

587
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,960
equipment have you always been obsessed

588
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,559
with

589
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,039
that I well it was happening with my

590
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,360
father who uh at the time was working as

591
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:17,480
a synagogue administrator in New

592
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,919
York and brought home a Wallen sack real

593
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,320
toore mhm and that became my favorite

594
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,399
toy

595
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,960
for the next 10 years

596
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:33,799
sure and then I graduated to

597
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:37,559
a t stereo machine then a t for

598
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,799
track but I've always and then at when I

599
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,320
was in college I learned how to

600
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,799
bounce from one stereo machine to

601
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,399
another one to do multitrack

602
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:51,279
recording and in fact I'm next week I'm

603
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,200
going to Vermont to get my honorary

604
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,320
doctorate degree that's from from Gard

605
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,720
college and that was my senior study

606
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:04,080
was a recording of three Blind

607
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,240
Mice that's fantastic yeah did now were

608
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,080
you originally I'm assuming your early

609
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,720
stuff that you were recording and being

610
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,600
obsessed with your own voice I only say

611
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,520
that because I I understand the I

612
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,159
understand the realities of being

613
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,559
obsessed with your own voice but uh were

614
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,960
they you're just being goofy with

615
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,880
yourself and your friends and eventually

616
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,679
I mean were you musical from I mean

617
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,440
maybe I don't know how many people know

618
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,760
like what a musician you are but you're

619
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,760
a musician uh as well as a comedian so

620
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,880
how how early I guess did music enter

621
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,520
into your

622
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,399
recording I would say by by

623
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,880
age 12 makes sense maybe even earlier

624
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:43,200
because my cousin Paul and I wrote some

625
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,760
of the worst songs ever really bad I

626
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
think that's one of the reasons my uncle

627
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,159
hated me he didn't hate me that's too

628
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,520
strong but he did die of a heart attack

629
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:56,279
listening to me

630
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,310
singing no um what kind of stuff are you

631
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,880
writing die uncle

632
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:04,720
[Laughter]

633
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,960
die what a horrible child yeah no we

634
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,919
wrote a song called the

635
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:15,520
eigor he's so cruel he brings his monkey

636
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:19,320
to school it was really terrible

637
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,320
stuff um and then I wrote One Sweet song

638
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,480
as a sort of a 12-year-old uh sing a

639
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,360
tiny bit of

640
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:32,200
it hey there miss lovely can can I talk

641
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,159

audio sorry I can't I can't even but I

643
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,159
did write some really good songs and I

644
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,240
even got one recorded commercially by

645
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,240
Buzz

646
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,200
KAS do you know that name I don't and I

647
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,279

648
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,720
wrote the song Everlasting Love sure in

649
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,919
the

650
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,679
70s Everlasting Love which was recorded

651
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,799
by a lot of different people mhm and on

652
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,519
the and my song no place for a lady

653
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,760
written under the pseudonym Johnny

654
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:09,600
trevit was a bside and one of

655
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,200
his songs holy crap people don't even

656
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,960
know bides yeah I know I know it's not

657
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,000
an issue anymore you pick what you want

658
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,559
wow see that's that's fascinating to me

659
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,440
so wait what year is this that we're

660
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:26,640
talking uh this is in the I guess the

661
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,159
60s I I signed with a publisher music

662
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,799
publisher in the' 60s uh mhm and I gave

663
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,880
the rights away to so many songs

664
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,399
thinking that was a good thing right oh

665
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,559
my God I thought it was in Show Business

666
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,279
yeah yeah I mean that's that's the thing

667
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,720
that's the draw I I often wonder too

668
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,440
like if if I would have stuck with

669
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,760
comedy if if I hadn't been better at

670
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,039
something else necessarily but you it's

671
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,519
interesting to me that you know as

672
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,000
wellknown as you are for comedy that you

673
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,880
got into it spec with with well what

674
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,600
kind of music was it that's that's my

675
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,880
question it was mostly original music

676
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,360
Anda a few cover songs and the songs

677
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,720
were written by me and I was the front

678
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,480
man for the

679
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,240
bandh uh couple of songs one song I

680
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,039
wrote with David mammo called This Heart

681
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,880
Is Clos for

682
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:16,519
alterations and Robin Williams sang it

683
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,039
on Mor and Mindy my goodness

684
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,480
um

685
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,000
and we did a cover song cover songs a

686
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,640
lot of R&B cover

687
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,760
songs uh but most of the songs original

688
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,679
and I had

689
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:37,760
a a very beautiful young woman play bass

690
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,720
her boyfriend was a great sax player

691
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,360
mhm it was a five-piece band and a good

692
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,810
on a good night we made

693
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,039
$500 and we never had a good

694
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:53,399
[Laughter]

695
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:53,399
night oh finally a joke

696
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,320
finally hey don't expect anything from

697
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,080
me cuz uh you know I I let every I I

698
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,640
save that for for my other podcasts

699
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:09,159
which are garbage admittedly um do

700
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,440
you so at this time was comedy even a in

701
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,120
your world other than you enjoyed it and

702
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,600
you were probably funny on your own with

703
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,399
friends I mean when did you start doing

704
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,679
I remember my first joke and I feel like

705
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:22,640
I'm dropping another name here but my

706
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,440
best friend in in elementary school was

707
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,480
Josh Mell the son of zero Mell holy cow

708
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,880
yeah sure and he once said to me me and

709
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,919
he was a very large kid M and he said to

710
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,360
me your bats in the

711
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,640
belfrey and I said to him thinking this

712
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,159
was funny and your fats in the belly

713
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:44,559
that was my first joke oh my

714
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,559
God but

715
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,799
um but I did get to say go to see him on

716
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:55,039
Broadway and sit stand the Wings and

717
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:58,240
watch half naked women walk out on stage

718
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,240
of course

719
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,799
and that would have been in Fiddler on

720
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,600
the

721
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,960
Roof a very risque production of Fiddler

722
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,120
on the Roof I guess that was a a funny

723
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,600
thing that happened on the Way to the

724
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,440
Forum I would hope so who was was Phil

725
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,159
Silvers ever in the actual stage show of

726
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,039
that am I just misremembering I know

there what you call your New

755
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,840
York yeah that's what we call it yeah

756
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,960
yeah I bet you there are 8 million

757
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,039
stories out there that's probably the

758
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,000
crossroad of a million private lives

759
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:14,120
broken heart for every light bulb of the

760
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,639
Great White Wave I like really goofy

761
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,960
stuff which is actually which is another

762
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,440
reason to bring it back to this album

763
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,279
one of the reasons I really enjoyed this

764
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,600
because it is very goofy and light in

765
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,679
tone except the stuff it's dealing with

766
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,880
is boy oh boy like so racially charged

767
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,840
in in such a great way

768
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,720
yeah um like I said the the subtitle

769
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,360
sort of is the new emerging bigot that's

770
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,080
I mean that's that's that's most of this

771
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,399
is uh that's underlying in all of this

772
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,480
it's just it it's this interesting Fu to

773
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,639
a time that they wish would go away I

774
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,080
feel like what do you mean by an

775
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:52,279
interesting Fu uh uh I should have just

776
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,120
said an interesting [ __ ] you uh instead

777
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,080
of uh yeah instead of shortening it

778
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,000
that's that's okay you know what word

779
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:04,440
really drives me nuts is Fran frig does

780
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,079
that bother you I I think it's so uh

781
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,079
without emotion sure oh I agree there's

782
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,960
there's no K we can start there there's

783
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,720
no k

784
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,679
sound I get it I understand about

785
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,679
censorship but

786
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,399
sure

787
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,040
um I'm just trying to think of if there

788
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,720
was anything

789
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:30,639
else around the time of Lenny Bruce and

790
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,560
Burns and Shor that was funny for

791
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,399
me did you ever have you ever met Jack

792
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,359
Burns did you ever meet Avery Shor

793
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:42,599
before live um but I did I don't know if

794
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:45,599
this is a song you've ever heard of that

795
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,679
a song that Bob Dylan you should play

796
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,919
this on your show cuz it's

797
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,440
um it's an obscure song of Bob Dylan's

798
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,720
called Lenny Bruce is dead you know

799
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,320
people have brought that up a few times

800
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,640
on the show and like an idiot I've never

801
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,240
looked it up yeah I'll try to send you

802
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,079
Rob can you remind me to send Jason that

803
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,920
song

804
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:11,440
um it's another thing that arrived home

805
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,400
by way of my uncle

806
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,640
mhm see that's that's a that's a fun

807
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,839
thing like it it's it's it's a mixed bag

808
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,560
when I talk to comedians of uh did your

809
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,680
parents bring comedy into the house or

810
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,880
were you introduced to it through

811
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,880
friends you had it just this a great

812
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,560
industry connection where I guess every

813
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,160
once in a while you'd get comedy also I

814
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,119
hear my mother was very funny I hear

815
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,800
this from my friends I I just found her

816
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:38,200
was wondering why she was hanging out

817
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:44,000
with me and my friends embarrassing

818
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:46,359
me my dad W loved my comedy mhm if he

819
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
saw other people his age

820
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:53,599
laughing but this is his best joke my

821
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,680
father's best joke uh hey Jason did you

822
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,040
hear about the fight at the bakery I

823
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,599
didn't what happened two roll got

824
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,280
fresh oh my God yeah that's what I was

825
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,599
up

826
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,599
against I had to find peace in that

827
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,920
world

828
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,240
oh but what's interesting to me though

829
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,960
is like you not you weren't just oh I

830
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,920
tried music first you didn't just try

831
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,720
music you did it and and you did it well

832
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,560
what when did comedy

833
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,079
happen comedy well this is the short

834
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:34,240
explanation when I sang people

835
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:38,760
talked and when I talked people listened

836
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:42,319
mhm and when I danced people

837
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,400
left so that's that's pretty that's the

838
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,240
an abbreviated version of my transition

839
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,720
from music to

840
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,680
Comedy but that seems then I mean you

841
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,440
could have potentially then made your

842
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,720
career as songwriter only if you'd had

843
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,160
done that but you needed to perform I

844
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,520
have to assume

845
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,680
yeah and I also could not write a hit

846
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,680
song I guess that would also change

847
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,520
things yeah the closest I came was a

848
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,000
song called the local motion oh wow well

849
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,480
there we go which which I wrote for

850
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,040
Little Eva uhhuh uh-huh uh but other

851
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,680
people deny that sure the guys who

852
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,800
actually wrote the

853
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,800
song you wrote a lot of leadbellies

854
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,560
tunes too didn't didn't you if I'm not

855
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,359
mistaken yeah in fact I call I was the

856
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,920
first guy to call him Leadbelly wow he

857
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,119
just went by lead better for a while and

858
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,310
you're like listen

859
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,560
yeah that's not going to catch

860
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:37,599
[Laughter]

861
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:41,480
on uh my other familial connection to

862
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,440
the music business was my father was

863
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,880
going to marry Woody

864
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,160
guth's ex-wife after he passed

865
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,599
away but she didn't like my father's

866
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,839
kids meaning me and my

867
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:58,680
sister so that didn't work out that's un

868
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,200
Arla Guth was could have been my half

869
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,240
brother I it became good friends with

870
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,680
with Nora Guthrie his sister mhm and

871
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,880
Jord Guthrie his

872
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,640
brother would you get half price tickets

873
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,359
if you went to the Guthrie in Minnesota

874
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,119
just curious if that were to happen if

875
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,720
that had gone through I did I did

876
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,560
perform at that theater you did with

877
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,760
with Robin Williams I toured with Robin

878
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,319
Williams

879
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,920
M that's another thing I was playing two

880
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:28,200
songs on tour with Robin

881
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,880
Williams um

882
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,920
born to be punished and this heart is

883
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,240
closed for alterations

884
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,880
uhhuh and he sang them both

885
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,880
and as only he

886
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,319
can when was this CU I I see online that

887
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,800
you're credited as musical director for

888
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:49,079
his 1979 tour is this after what you're

889
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,599
talking about now or what what are we

890
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,880
talking about the tour was in 78 and was

891
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,760
one of the worst credits ever because

892
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,280
he's not a musician he's a comedian yeah

893
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:04,000
it be likeing be like um being

894
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,160
the uh in charge of Comedy for Isaac

895
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,160
Stern right

896
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,160
right to do all his Woody quips between

897
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,720
sonatas so see that's so were you okay

898
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,800
so this is what's what's hurting my

899
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,520
brain is the idea of him performing

900
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,760
music and that is something that would

901
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,920
not have occurred to

902
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,520
me well it here's how that happened is

903
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,319
that he his first

904
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,160
wife uh a woman named

905
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:39,680
Valerie uh was my girlfriend in

906
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,440
college

907
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,640
and many years later she introduced us

908
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,480
and she said Jonathan I married this

909
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,079
very funny guy and he should do your

910
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,040
songs and I said

911
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,920
okay yeah I mean who are you to turn

912
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,839
that down but wow that's and was it just

913
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,960
for this one tour then that this

914
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:01,720
happened I mean we we we remained

915
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,000
friends and we became fathers around the

916
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:11,040
same time so our my oldest daughter hung

917
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,880
out with his baby boy wow what is okay

918
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,520
so and be my apologies for not knowing

919
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,839
what album did an album come from that

920
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,560
tour I have to imagine reality what a

921
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,960
concept okay okay I thought so and I

922
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,680
think I have a credit on the album I

923
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,319
don't have a song however but you do

924
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,119
have a credit on the album itself yeah

925
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:31,119
cuz I played acoustic guitar

926
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,880
with a

927
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,880
um his opening act was this act called

928
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,960
Rick and Ruby okay one wonderful act

929
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,640
from San Francisco and they played

930
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,839
electric guitar and she sang and there

931
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,839
was a Pianist named Josh Brody who was

932
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,280
wonderful MH but they they were very

933
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,960
quirky

934
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,160
and I actually like I could watch their

935
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:00,280
act night after night and Robin I could

936
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,280
only watch a couple of times

937
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:07,680
because uh his energy scared me I can

938
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,040
completely understand that yeah yeah I

939
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,640
mean that's a I mean it

940
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,760
was it's a it's a trite comparison but

941
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,520
what it must have been like to be around

942
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,960
Jonathan Winters except maybe again

943
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,720
including the drugs it had to have been

944
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:27,440
it its own thing yeah wow I once sold a

945
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,359
vial of his urine for $500 to someone of

946
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,079
his

947
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,079
fans and it wasn't even

948
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:44,240
broke but um no this is he was so hot in

949
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:47,240
78 off off of Mor Mor and Mindy

950
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,760
mhm but

951
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:55,520
he was an amazing talent he really

952
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,119
was um and as an actor as well as a

953
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,720
comedian well sure yeah of course I mean

954
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,800
that's it's it's it's so hard

955
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,319
to that energy can be so like you said

956
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,280
it can be scary maybe to some

957
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:09,560
off-putting uh we just did a tribute

958
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,319
episode to him a few weeks ago a live

959
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,520
episode that was a tribute to Robin and

960
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,760
uh I mean that's one of those things we

961
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,359
talk about where some people don't

962
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,079
necessarily appreciate the skill that

963
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:22,520
went into being that crazy on stage uh

964
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,280
you know and uh like to be in front of

965
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,680
it I can again maybe again not

966
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,640
necessarily even intimidating but

967
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,599
definitely it's like where theck is this

968
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,359
coming from that it would make me

969
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,720
anxious I know the person I am I can

970
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,760
tell that would make me incredibly

971
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,920
anxious to be around but

972
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,480
fascinating yeah the last time I saw

973
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,599
Robin was at at the Four Seasons in

974
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:49,000
Boston mhm and I told him a joke and it

975
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,720
just he was such a generous laugher mhm

976
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,280
and I told him I had seen a production

977
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,280
of The Vagina Monologues with Senor

978
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,119
Wes and

979
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,240
um he would turn a joke into like a half

980
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,599
hour bit

981
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,559

1065
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,800
such a great time at this

1066
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,559
convention because I discovered that

1067
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,800
what people do with these conventions is

1068
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:45,400
they get high I had no

1069
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,400

would he's another guy whose involvement

1073
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,400
in the comedy that I love I feel like

1074
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,880
was underrated until you know I

1075
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,599
discovered the credibility gap years ago

1076
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,559
when I first grabbed one of their albums

1077
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:05,640
and uh you know in my head he was just

1078
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:08,880
from Le and Shirley until oh crap oh

1079
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:13,680

1080
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:16,960
genius and uh wow yeah I have you ever

1082
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,920
that kind of Comedy since you do really

1083
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:24,800

1088
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,240
ASU which is

1089
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,599
just just the name itself is such a

1090
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,440
wonderful setup for a bit but he I'm

1091
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,440
sure he you know he lives in La I'm sure

1092
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,000
he would be happy to do your show that

1093
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,720
would be great I I have reached out to

1094
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,480
him and uh that would be something uh

1095
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:56,960
that would be fantastic I don't know

1096
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,920
what kind of physical shape he's in

1097
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,000
cuz it takes a different course in

1098
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,480
everybody yeah

1099
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,480
um but

1100
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,319
uh trying to think of who else has a

1101
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,079
connection to Comedy in those

1102
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:15,839
days did you ever get Lenny Bruce's

1103
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,440
daughter on the show that's another

1104
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,079
person I've reached out to I've tried to

1105
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,040
get her on the show a few times and

1106
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,400
that's something we've interviewed you

1107
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,000
know the the Sons and Daughters of of

1108
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,520
some of my favorite comedians and we

1109
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,960
hope to do more of that also but uh

1110
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,880
every once in a while I I'll find out a

1111
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,160
few of them are friends already so I

1112
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,839
like for instance Kelly Carlin and and

1113
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,520
Rob newart I'm going to try and get them

1114
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,520
both on the same episode to talk about

1115
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,839
Richard prior because I think that would

1116
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,839
be a lot of

1117
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:46,440
fun this is just a what what we used to

1118
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:49,160
call a coincidence is that Richard PRI

1119
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:52,599
and I have the same birthday and the

1120
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:55,440
same and the same illness that he had

1121
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,960
not was not his biggest medical problem

1122
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,880
but he did have MS sure um and it's the

1123
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,280
same birthday it's shared by Woody Allen

1124
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,799
and Sarah

1125
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,040
Silverman that's interesting and then

1126
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:09,920
also a guy named ed

1127
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,400
Hawkin that is also that is equally

1128
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,119
interesting even though I don't know the

1129
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,000
name Ed Hawkin is a financial planner

1130
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:17,000
who couldn't make it in

1131
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,160
comedy jeez I'm so

1132
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,240
predictable do do you have a favorite

1133
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,520
line off of this album I had to write

1134
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,520
down some of mine that that kind of

1135
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,680
stuck

1136
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,559
out I'm just trying to think there was

1137
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,240
something about it might be in the cab

1138
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,760
thing

1139
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,920
about

1140
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,599
uh I guess Jack Burns is talking

1141
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,480
about uh what was what it's like at

1142
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:50,960
conventions he goes to uhhuh and he say

1143
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,160
I was up there all night with this guy

1144
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,839
we had we had win with wilky

1145
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,559
ties um it puts talks about putting a

1146
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,119
lampshade on his head which is a big

1147
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:02,119
deal in those

1148
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,799
days uh I never quite saw the appeal of

1149
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:15,880
that but um let me see about in the um

1150
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,240
in the faith healer

1151
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,440
one uh I

1152
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,760
think um they do say kakami for Christ

1153
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,440
which is one of my favorite yeah lines

1154
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:31,160
in that and also um

1155
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,839
the reverend's name is is Moly yeah so

1156
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,040
he says holy moly so ridiculous but I

1157
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,440
love it

1158
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,440
um they just were nuts those guys that

1159
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,440
were great

1160
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,559
um the sound of the Communist frog I

1161
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:50,200
mentioned that already yes right right

1162
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,520
right I'm going to do my impression of a

1163
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,720
communist frog and then you can then you

1164
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:59,000
can uh play theirs this this is this is

1165
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,000
how I would portray a communist

1166
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
frog

1167
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:07,319
ribbed um and they have a totally

1168
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,799
different approach they certainly do

1169
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:10,400
yeah I'm trying to think of what else I

1170
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:12,880
could do that with

1171
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,119
there there is a bit where he's asking

1172
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,040
one gentleman about it and uh his accent

1173
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:22,640
seems to reveal quite a bit to the to

1174
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:25,319
the Reverend I'm a convite yeah and also

1175
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,680
one of my favorite lines is um he the

1176
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:30,680
first time he's trying to be healed is

1177
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:35,640
he he's portraying a guy with with a

1178
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:38,280
immobile thumb yes and and Jack burn

1179
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,599
says immobility immobility immobility

1180
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,240
how many times have I heard that

1181
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,080
tiresome

1182
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:46,400
phrase three

1183
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:49,599

yeah so what do you uh you drive a cab

1213
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:16,559
huh yes sometimes yeah you're lucky you

1214
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:19,440
caught me when I

1215
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,240
was it's this it's this interesting mix

1216
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,680
of like obviously these guys come from

1217
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,319
uh this new emerging not all that new I

1218
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,480
guess in 19 what do we say 19 197 no

1219
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:32,440
this is 1965 so it's it's newer this

1220
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,880
this this form of uh of improv but

1221
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,400
there's also there's always this uh

1222
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,000
temptation to go a little sticky which

1223
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,760
is fine because that's I love that kind

1224
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,640
of Comedy but it is funny listening to

1225
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,040
that mix because you don't find it as

1226
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,079
much in in improv where people are

1227
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,640
taking it a lot I guess more seriously

1228
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:52,119
for whatever reason um so you don't find

1229
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,319
like the temptation to go shticky as you

1230
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:57,040
as you might then you know you said

1231
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:59,079
you've said the word shticky yep should

1232
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,880
I say it again which makes me feel like

1233
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:04,799
you should book Andy Kindler on your

1234
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,960
podcast he he is already booked and I I

1235
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:08,079
don't know when that's going to happen

1236
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:11,839
but I I am so excited for whenever that

1237
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:14,960
is yeah he's so wonderful absolutely he

1238
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,720
is and when I when I when I when he's in

1239
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,359
therapy with me on stage which you which

1240
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:25,079
you've been doing lately he says Dr cats

1241
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:25,079
are you doing shtick

1242
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,960
he's wonderful IND oh God it's a genius

1243
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:35,400
uh and there's there there only certain

1244
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,839
types of comedians who can keep alive a

1245
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,240
certain type of humor without it seeming

1246
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:42,240
uh like a hack move like you can still

1247
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,640
build on these older forms of Comedy I

1248
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,079
mean otherwise improv wouldn't still be

1249
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:50,040
alive either because it's just a tool

1250
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,720
it's a fun tool that you can use you

1251
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,040
know

1252
00:54:51,720 --> 00:55:00,000
um you know when we before we did Dr K I

1253
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:02,880
go out to to see live improv with with

1254
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,760
my friend Tom snd the co-creator of the

1255
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,079
show and we decided we didn't like it

1256
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,040
that much CU they should just do the

1257
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:15,000
funny parts right which is why editing

1258
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:17,440
became so valuable

1259
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,960
sure I mean that's and that that's

1260
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,319
another huge huge thing too is there is

1261
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:25,680
there are a couple examples in that

1262
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,000
period U of when Dr cats came out uh of

1263
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,480
stuff that's

1264
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,559
that feels improvised uh and usually is

1265
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,039
but also has the benefit of editing

1266
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,680
yours has more the benefit of editing

1267
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,440
than a Christopher Guest documentary but

1268
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,760
there these these things that may not

1269
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,599
that you're responsible for this but

1270
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,559
these things that made everybody think

1271
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,920
they could

1272
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,280
improvise and uh a lot of people are

1273
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,520
trying to recapture the magic of again

1274
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,319
Dr cats or any Christ one of those

1275
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,520
people is Larry David on Curb Your

1276
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,720
Enthusiasm sure who who asked Tom Snider

1277
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,319
how we could possibly get such a natural

1278
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,960
sound

1279
00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:06,559
mhm he would

1280
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:09,400
never uh he's not big with the

1281
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,480
attribution Larry David that happens

1282
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,200
that'll happen yeah in this in this in

1283
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,720
this

1284
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,839
business

1285
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,839
uh is that where we have to leave it I

1286
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:21,319
feel like we have to leave that that I

1287
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:24,160
think so I mean he married he married my

1288
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:27,079
ex-manager so our lives became sort of

1289
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:30,640
intermingled for a while there that is

1290
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:33,599
interesting I don't know what to make of

1291
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,520
that well I think the the what I made of

1292
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:41,000
it is that she didn't really find me

1293
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,000
attractive that's oh that's been

1294
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:48,470
Mar I gave him his own ringtone that's

1295
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,920
you're so generous yeah

1296
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:54,440
[Music]

1297
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,359
um let's see if they left a message was

1298
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,960
coming from 213 which is your

1299
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:01,079
neighborhood that is true van lives

1300
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,160
right down the street

1301
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:06,559
yeah um do you remember is there just

1302
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,280
because I really do like this cover do

1303
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,680
you

1304
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,640
remember are there any particular albums

1305
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,559
in terms of album art since you seems

1306
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,799
like you got brought home a lot of stuff

1307
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:18,359
was there anything in particular stood

1308
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:21,799
out I wanted to decorate the basement of

1309
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:24,520
my home with album

1310
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:27,160
artwork but my

1311
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,520
wife uh had other

1312
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,240
plans yeah that'll happen so I mean I

1313
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,520
did throw out some amazing album covers

1314
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,400
most of them were music I don't think

1315
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,880
any were

1316
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:41,039
comedy see that's that's the thing about

1317
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,960
like I mean I I think by I just have to

1318
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,240
because I do this podcast I do have one

1319
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,160
at least half of a wall are a lot of

1320
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,480
album covers that I particularly love

1321
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,200
but there's never enough room for all

1322
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,240
the ones that I especially I just keep

1323
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,039
discovering newer and newer ones or

1324
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,160
getting signed ones on occasion like

1325
00:57:54,039 --> 00:58:00,680
from fire sign theater or Rusty Warren

1326
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:02,079
uh I I love having those as a reminder

1327
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,359
they're nice I mean the these bits of

1328
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,480
art I actually have a friend who I think

1329
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,280
he just said he's going to be framing

1330
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,960
he's got enough copies of this one fire

1331
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,200
sign album that he's cut it in half so

1332
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,039
he can frame the entire piece as one

1333
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,240
long one long piece of art which is kind

1334
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,319
of great I have to revisit Fire Sun

1335
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:23,520
theater

1336
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:26,240
cuz I I was in a little too distracted

1337
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,520
at the time they came out mhm understand

1338
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,720
understandable a lot a lot of people

1339
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,880
were I feel like that's that's why that

1340
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,920
that's one of the reasons why they're

1341
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:37,559
not as they're not given nearly as much

1342
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,359
credit as as as they they deserve um you

1343
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:41,599
know uh for breaking a lot of a lot of

1344
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:43,200
new ground or a lot of ground that might

1345
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,680
have been being broken at the same time

1346
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,319
by other people who were then more

1347
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,079
recognized recognized for you got a you

1348
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:50,760
got a long back catalog to go through

1349
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:55,559
but there's a lot of great stuff in

1350
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:57,000
there yeah well the good news is that uh

1351
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,880
I have all all the time in the world no

1352
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,720
I don't I wish I

1353
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,960
did but I think tell me when you feel

1354
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,720
like we are have a comfortable amount of

1355
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,240
material for you to work with yeah I was

1356
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,960
actually just about to ask you if you're

1357
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,240
going to recommend this album for people

1358
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,000
to listen to if they don't know who

1359
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,599
burns and shriber are or even if they do

1360
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,160
and they're not familiar with this type

1361
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,079
of material what's a good reason to

1362
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,799
listen to this album and give this one a

1363
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:25,280
listen as their first bit of exposure to

1364
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:27,520
them well I'm just I just I'm missing

1365
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,520
another call which is Okay the reason

1366
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,880
the reason to listen to Burns and triber

1367
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,280
is because they're

1368
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:38,720
silly they're

1369
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:45,000
incredibly well rehearsed mhm

1370
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:47,599
they are almost like a a musical on

1371
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,960
uh they're very there's a lot of

1372
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,920
musicality in their act with the

1373
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,920
exception of Avery shriber playing the

1374
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,880
guitar which I don't think is

1375
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,440
necessary right um but just the way

1376
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,720
their

1377
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:04,839
voices work together and the way they

1378
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:07,319
step on each other's lines and it's that

1379
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:11,559
wonderful thing where they cut each

1380
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:11,559
other off in a comedic

1381
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,359
way

1382
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:23,640
um and I think it's it's just

1383
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:27,119
politically potent it's a really

1384
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:28,559
wonderful picture of what life was like

1385
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,599
at that

1386
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,280
time yeah I mean it's not even

1387
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:34,240
necessarily the hippie aesthetic it's

1388
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,960
its own thing and I like that that we

1389
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:39,920
can find something from uh this period

1390
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,559
that's got its own feeling to it I mean

1391
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,599
it's these two guys that are doing all

1392
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:48,720
making all their commentary through very

1393
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:51,720
seemingly silly sketches that underneath

1394
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,720
them are a lot deeper yeah you know they

1395
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,640
they they had their own show for after

1396
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,599
that and they were appeared on The Dean

1397
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:02,520
Martin Show which is a credit I don't

1398
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:05,400
have unfortunately

1399
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,520
um but uh you know you were talking

1400
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,520
about Robin's genius and backtracking a

1401
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,799
little

1402
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:14,960
bit he had the same gift that Letterman

1403
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:18,039
had was to make things appear

1404
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,280
spontaneous sure and that's such an

1405
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:22,319
amazing

1406
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,079
talent yeah I mean the idea of

1407
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,640
retreading something like even like this

1408
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,039
it starts out in as Improv and making it

1409
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,400
again to be able to interrupt somebody

1410
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:31,640
and and act as though you made that

1411
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,079
decision or to act like you're being

1412
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,640
interrupted for the first time that's

1413
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:38,839
there's an awful lot of skill there

1414
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,520
yeah my dad went to came to see me on

1415
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:43,720
Letterman one night and he the first he

1416
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,559
asked a producer who was Bob Morton at

1417
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,359
the time mhm he said to him do you

1418
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,440
really need all these

1419
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:53,200
people he couldn't believe how many

1420
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,559
people were involved in making a a half

1421
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,520
hour of

1422
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,799

1423
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:04,039
crew but

1424
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:07,440
