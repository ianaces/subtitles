ways Ray noticed he was wearing

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,599
headphones thus making our approach much

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,720
easier we worked our way around the

66
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:25,800

hour so our luck seemed to dry

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,360
up Ray and I talked a while and decided

85
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,080
to change our

86
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,599
plan what we needed was a different

87
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,880
strategy I suggested a lure of some sort

88
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,880
Ray agreed

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,680
silly balloons clowns just can't resist

90
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,680

97
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,520
you know hunting is relaxing and fun but

98
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,120
it can be dangerous too that's right Ray

99
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,639
that's why you should always be cautious

100
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,120
when using Firearms last year alone over

101
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,560
50 Hunters were hurt is that so maybe

102
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,919
they would not have injured each other

103
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,319
if they would have followed these four

104
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,960
easy

105
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,879
rules one treat all guns as if they are

106
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,000
loaded two treat all other Hunters as if

107
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,599
they are loaded three only point a gun

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,440
at something you intend to shoot and

109
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,519
number four always be sure of your

110
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,919
target before you shoot follow these

111
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:42,080
