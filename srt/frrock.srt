historian but you're a DJ music business

225
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,040
but over a quarter of a century now and

226
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,320
fan and fan no it actually goes back

227
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,320
about uh to 1955 so we're looking at

228
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,839
about 35 years wow that's a long time

229
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,560
and as a matter of fact unlike a lot of

230
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,920
people I remember the first day I heard

231
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,399
my first rock and roll record Rock

232
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,600
Around the Clock in the movie Blackboard

233
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,720
Jungle the cedar theater on Cedar Avenue

234
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,680
and I told a friend of mine I said

235
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,360
something's going on here and we stayed

236
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,360
to hear the music again at the end of

237
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
the show I went home bought a copy of

238
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
the record and I used to have to listen

239
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,600
to the radio under the pillow and

240
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,760
covers and one night I fell sleep and

241
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
the radio melted because I had tubes in

242
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,360
them back then so I could listen to this

243
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,920
rock and roll music cuz my parents uh

244
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
were concerned about listening to that

245
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,839
kind of music and what it do to me in

246
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,000
fact speaking of that kind of music that

247
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,560
brings a point was at this rock and roll

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,880
where does Rock and Roll come from well

249
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,279
the earliest thing I remember hearing

250
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,000
rock and roll in the Twin Cities was a

251
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,680
fellow named Augie Garcia and uh I used

252
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,079
to when I was 10 11 12 years old I was

253
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,839
almost six foot tall I mean I was a big

254
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,279
kid and I used to pretend I was shining

255
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,440
shoes to get into the clubs to hear

256
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,399
these great musicians and it goes back

257
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,639
to guys like Augie Garcia and some of

258
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,800
the R&B clubs in town down on nicholet

259
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,279

261
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,320

that we're talking about rock and roll U

367
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,279
talk about some early rock and roll

368
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,759
figures you know a man that I absolutely

369
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:30,160
love and I met a few times is Bo deadly

370
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,720
tell me about Bo I only met the guy once

371
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
uh and he's bitter that's the best way

372
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,959
to put it about the way he was treated

373
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,120
by the rock and roll industry right and

374
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,319
one thing about Bo dley he is just truly

375
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,120
one of the great pioneers he's going to

376
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:42,680
be in town uh this coming week I'm going

377
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,319
to see him and he puts on a great show

378
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,319
and I remember watching a video tape

379
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:49,480
that he was on down in Louisiana he had

380
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,440
70,000 people in the streets during an

381
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,680
event down there rocking from the front

382
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,519
row all the way to the back the man is

383
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,079
just a dynamite Entertainer but never

384
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,360
got his does that's true that's very

385
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,000
true and it's so funny that B's been

386
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,279
Rock and rolling for so many years and

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,720
it's not until he did his commercial

388
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,519
with Bo Jackson they got more

389
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,800
recognition that's really a shame real

390
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,360
quick we got to wrap up here and I I

391
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,399
wish we had more time who's the king of

392
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,639
rock and

393
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,319
roll well I've got to say Little Richard

394
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,480
and I don't say that because some

395
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:17,199
obvious reasons but

396
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,240
uh the first time I saw Little Richard

397
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,839
was down at the lon on nicholet Avenue

398
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,360
in Lake Street and Jimmy Hendricks was

399
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,639
his guitar player uh really goes back a

400
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,040
long way and one thing about Little

401
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,720
Richard uh he just captivates uh the

402
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,319
audience and every time I hear a rock

403
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,880
and roll song you here here or see

404
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,920
Little Richard that's that's very true

405
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,680
everything's just spin-off how about

406
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,560
Chuck Bay what's his influence Chuck is

407
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,880

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,839
guitar also I mean in Guitar it's

409
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,120
everything and uh by the way Chuck

410
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,800

because I think Minneapolis is a big

453
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,240
city that has a lot of the virtues of a

454
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,760
small town just yesterday I was driving

462
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,240
out of your house at night burglars

463
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,360

other day they're so security minded all

467
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,880
the coat hangers are attached to a metal

468
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,840
pipe for security doesn't do any good

469
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,120
somebody took my jacket left the

470
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,039

486
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,840
valy oh this is f how much time have I

487
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,360
got left here two minutes I wanted to

488
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,480
explain something to you I was talking

489
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,200
to Dell Roberts earlier and he knows so

490
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,360
much about music I never knew this

491
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,720
before there any fans of Blues out there

492
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,480
Blues I've always loved the blues and I

493
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,679
didn't know this about it it surprised

494
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,520
me Dell explained to me that the blues

495
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,520
actually originated in ancient

496
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,640
Scandinavia

497
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,640
it was actually early

498
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,799
Vikings who first invented the blues and

499
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,320
and they they went on one of their crazy

500
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,600
Viking raids uh to

501
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,679
Chicago they taught it to people there

502
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,840
and then returned to Norway and Sweden

503
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,159
to develop that accordion

504
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,120
music so if you ever listen to the real

505
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,360
early Blues recordings you're going to

506
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,039
hear a lot of that old Viking influence

507
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,690
and just to demonstrate it sounds

508
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:14,869
something like

509
