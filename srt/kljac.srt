great when Christians are upset at

85
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,960
seeing atheists enjoying Christmas I

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,240
feel like I have to explain to them what

87
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,000
an atheist is like I'm an atheist that

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,080
means I don't believe in God that's all

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
it means it doesn't mean that I reject

90
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,000
everything in their Bible there are

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,319
parts of their Bible that I really love

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,840
parts that mean a lot to me parts that

93
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,560
are beautiful like I love in their Bible

94
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,440
where it says that you should go out

95
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,199
into the woods and fell a tree and then

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,160
drag it back to your house and stand it

97
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,599
up and decorate it all in astrological

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,680
symbols it's good

99
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:21,360

191
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,800
one of these guys that said when I die I

192

tongues on the bottom of my

379
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,760
feet so that I can kick things and taste

380
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,400
them

381
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,600

such an amazing person for two decades

393
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,840
uh but I also sometimes feel weird about

394
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,320
telling people CU I think that when you

395
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,880
say to someone I've been in a

396
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,520
heterosexual monogamous relationship for

397
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,520
20 years what they're thinking is yeah

398
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,520
this guy's boring in the

399
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,919
bedroom right because being in a

400
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,200
relationship for two decades like that

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,360
to the children and we can't stay on our

426
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,720
moral High ground and refuse to fight

427
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,360
fire with fire it's time to lie to the

428
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,799
children do you know that they're

429
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,640
telling kids that condoms don't work by

430
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,600
using this scientific tidbit the pores

431
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,279
in a condom the little microscopic pores

432
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,720
in a condom are actually bigger than an

433
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,440
AIDS virus so the AIDS virus can get

434
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,679
right through them of course because we

435
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,200
all know that aids viruses ride tiny

436
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,200
little bicycles and travel on their

437
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
own

438
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,520
we need to be willing to lie to the

439
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,679
children we need to say kids kids kids

440
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,960
listen listen the reason they're so bent

441
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,720
about condoms is that there's actually a

442
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,080
loophole in the Bible and sex with a

443
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,080
condom doesn't actually count a sex at

444
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,640
all it's

445
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,320
true just bang all you want you can

446
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,799

announcement I wish they would let me do

457
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,159
public service announcements cuz I did

458
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,400
drugs and I drank alcohol and they were

459
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,400

moved on I could give good advice

464
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,360
instead they always have somebody who

465
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,799
was terrible at

466
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,919
it come and talk to

467
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,240
you and they don't give you advice it's

468
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,880
going to help you it's just say no yeah

469
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,080

yourself no imagine if I had a public

472
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,600
service announcement they'd zoom in on

473
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,559

waitress at Denny's at 3 in the morning

487
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,960
because she didn't stay away from the

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
white drugs and she's gonna mess with

489
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,960

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,250

508
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,679
you went to church

509
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,279
[Applause]

510
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,360
camp I hope they never figure out how

511
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,600
badly those things are backfiring

512
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,960
on they're the most awesome little

513
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,159
atheist factories it's

514
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,799
just so

515
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,600
great so I went to church camp and I got

516
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,480
up early in the morning to go use the

517
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,000
swimming pool and uh I get to the

518
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,840
swimming pool and there's one other

519
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,399
person already there and she's swimming

520
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,039
across the pool so I sit down and uh she

521
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:41,559
gets out on the other side and I realize

522
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,679
that she's swimming in nothing but a

523
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,679
t-shirt with nothing

524
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,600
underneath I don't know if you guys know

525
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,679
what happens when a t-shirt is soaking

526
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,240
wet there are

527
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,640
contests

528
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,000
uh I'm not sure if she was training to

529
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,520
compete or not uh but she could have she

530
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,360
could have I would have given her a 10 I

531
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,799
was pleased to be there at that moment

532
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
and so she walks in front of me and I

533
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,559
expect her to keep going embarrassed and

534
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,360
leave but no she walks around to the

535
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,240
other side of the pool and jumps back in

536
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,679
and gets back out on the other side

537
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,880
again which means she now knows I'm

538
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,360
there and is fine with it and this gives

539
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,679
me the most tremendous erection I've

540
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,679
ever

541
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,600
had she walks in front of me again she

542
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,520
jumps in the

543
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,520
pool

544
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,039
she gets out on the other side and I'm

545
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,120
sorry to say this please be generous I

546
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,760
was very young but it was at that point

547
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,520
that for the first time I actually

548
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,520
looked up at her

549
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,200
face shouldn't have taken so long I know

550
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,880
but when I looked at her face I went oh

551
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:54,320
I know her that's my friend Sue and Sue

552
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,840
is developmentally

553
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,600
disabled yeah which screwed up this

554
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,640
whole consent she knows I'm looking

555
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,120
thing and made me feel really horribly

556
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,480
guilty I said my friend Sue has a

557
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,159
disability and I just exploited her she

558
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,440
didn't know what she was doing and I

559
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,520
took advantage of it and I felt terrible

560
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,200
I was horribly morally conflicted and I

561
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,440
say conflicted because not all of me uh

562
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,399
had a problem with

563
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,919
this there was one part of me that was

564
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:25,720
like

565
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,679
still like do you have a soul and then

566
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,840
he was like what you're still looking

567
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,320
and I was like damn it I know I

568
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:36,240
[Laughter]

569
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,399
am Sue walked by again and as I my gaze

570
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
followed her I noticed that Kenny had

571
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,000
entered the pool area and Kenny was one

572
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,159
of the counselors at this church camp

573
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,880
and I thought these are the kind of

574
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,360
moments that these counselors are here

575
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,039
for so I strategically arranged a towel

576
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,480
and then walked over to talk to Kenny

577
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,440
and I get there and I say hey Kenny and

578
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,880
he says hey little dude and I said can I

579
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,519
talk to you for a minute he says sure I

580
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,760
have a seat and I sit next to Kenny

581
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,000
Kenny and Kenny is playing with a huge

582
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,960
gash that he put in his knee uh hiking

583
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,279
or skateboarding or something and he

584
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,240
hadn't taken care of it and it was

585
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:12,200
swollen up and disgusting looking and he

586
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,080
says check out my knee bro and I look at

587
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,240
his knee and he

588
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,240
says doesn't it look like a

589
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,399
[ __ ] my answer to Kenny was

590
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,640
two-part

591
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,640
the first part was I don't

592
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,360
know the second part was oh my God I

593
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,360
hope

594
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,960
[Applause]

595
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:52,000
[Laughter]

596
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,679
not but my erection had gone

597
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,480
away so that was

598
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,159
cool then a female counselor came out

599
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,720
and saw Sue and went over and wrapped a

600
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:04,799
towel around her and took her away to

601
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,440
teach her about undergarments and I want

602
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,000
went back to my cabin and masturbated

603
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,000
and became an

604
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:18,840
atheist that's not the true story of how

605
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,159
I became an atheist it's a true story

606
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,799
but not the true story of how I became

607
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,640
an atheist but the true story of how I

608
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,440
became an atheist involves books and

609
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,320
reading and all this boring stuff I like

610
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,320
that one

611
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
better

612
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,119
how'd you become an atheist [ __ ]

613
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,119
[Music]

614
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,480
knee I think it's a good

615
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:47,720
answer you guys get Robo calls oh yeah

616
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,960
yeah why'd you sound so

617
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:53,360
unhappy you gotta you gotta maintain a

618
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,080
child sense of wonderment about these

619
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,840
things think about it when you were a

620
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:04,480
kid if they told you that in the future

621
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,480
you were going to get phone calls from

622
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,360
robots that would have sounded way

623
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,519
cooler than it has actually turned out

624
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,440
to

625
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:20,200
be oh heinan how you've disappointed

626
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,720
me I like to imagine that the robots

627
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,720
calling me are at least wearing high

628
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,799
heels and some

629
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:31,360
leather something exciting is going on

630
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:34,279
we get we get one Robo call all the time

631
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,039
uh or we were getting it you answer the

632
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:41,000
phone and you hear Google that's right

633
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,799
Google and we got it so often that that

634
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,760
became a greeting at my house like I'd

635
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,600
walk in and say Google and my wife and

636
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,440
kid would say that's right Google and

637
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,640
then we would go about our night

638
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,320
together so it was funny it was funny

639
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,799
for a while but then I got tired of it

640
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,799
so I answered found Google that's right

641
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,760
Google and I wait through the whole

642
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,919
recording

643
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,080
and then they get to the end and they're

644
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,880
giving you the options you know uh to be

645
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,279
annoyed in another language PR you know

646
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,200
uh and then finally I he to talk to a

647
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,519
live operator hit this button I hit the

648
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,600
button uh they Place him Antonio Carlos

649
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,960

650
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,159

um no it's beautiful music and they

652
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,679
shouldn't be abusing it that way it's

653
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,120
just wrong uh and then the guy comes on

654
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,840
and he says would you like to be on the

655
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,799
front page of Google

656
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,880
and I was like oh man I think I'm

657
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,639
talking to the guy that made the

658
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,320
recording this is

659
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:38,080
amazing but then it Dawns on me I hadn't

660
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,360
come up with anything clever to say like

661
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,440
I just dialed right away and I'm

662
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,919
thinking I'm supposed to be a comedian

663
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,679
I'm supposed to be quick on my feet

664
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,320
think of something to say come on do it

665
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,320
so I

666
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,320
say

667
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,000
gole and he replies yes

668
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,880
Google like this is the most enthusiasm

669
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,720
he's had all day like I hear other

670
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,559
operators coming and gathering around

671
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,120
him like come on Jeff's got one on the

672
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:16,120
line you know you can do it buddy you

673
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,360
can do it I gave him another one

674
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,240
Google he says yes yes we'll get you

675
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,760
right on the front page of Google and

676
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,360
then he starts explaining to me how

677
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
they're going to do it and it's really

678
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,399
complicated considering I've presented

679
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,440
myself as a not that smart cave man at

680
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,320
this point it's got algorithms and all

681
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,159
this other stuff and the weird thing

682
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,760
about these sales people is they expect

683
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,279
you to cut them off they expect you to

684
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,840
hang up so they try to just talk as

685
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,600
quick as they can and if you don't stop

686
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,639
them they will stumble right into

687
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,919
personal business it's amazing oh Google

688
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:48,559
and we'll do this and we'll get you on

689
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,039
the front page and oh you're really

690
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,519
going to like it I hope so you know I

691
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,120
deal with a lot of rejection in this

692
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,600
business my uh my wife thinks I don't

693
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,080
work that hard cuz I get to sit down for

694
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,039
a living but you can really start

695
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,519
feeling bad about yourself your

696
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:05,720
time the guy finishes and he's given me

697
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:09,480
a lot to think about you

698
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,480
know I'll think it over and I

699
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,480
say

700
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:19,360
Google at which point he

701
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,360
says

702
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,120
yeah

703
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,080
Google and then I remembered something

704
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,000
that a friend of mine who did phone work

705
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,919
had told

706
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,200
me which is that they're not allowed to

707
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,039
hang

708
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,159
up and I had nothing to do that

709
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,440
night like

710
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:44,960
cool this poor guy is like pulling out

711
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,000
the employee manual and just reading

712
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,200
everything to have something to keep

713
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,200
saying and I just keep

714
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,120
Google

715
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Google

716
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,960
Google

717
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Google

718
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,360
then after a

719
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,560
while he says yeah yeah Google we can

720
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,639
get you on front page Google listen we

721
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,079
can also get you on the front page of

722
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,839
Yahoo and much to my surprise I found

723
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:22,000
some brand loyalty had kicked

724
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:25,879
in when he said Yahoo it got my dander

725
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,399
up and I replied

726
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,800
Google

727
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,320
and to my

728
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:38,119
delight he started playing

729
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:41,119
along and in a perfect Clint Eastwood he

730
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,119
said

731
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,839
[Applause]

732
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:48,280
[Laughter]

minutes yelled highly patented but

742
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:23,119
completely nonsensical sounds at one

743
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,599
another possibly thousands of miles

744
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,800
apart from one

745
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,599
another and and then my favorite thing

746
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,839
happened I

747
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,200
heard all right thanks brother man you

748
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,200

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,359
click

750
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,960
Victory but the more I thought about it

751
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,720
and started telling other people about

752
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,920
it it started Dawning on me what a

753
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,800
magical thing it was that had happened I

754
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,839
mean two adults two adult

755
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,480
strangers paused in their day to to play

756
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,680
like children to tap their imagination

757
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,280
in the way that we don't do often enough

758
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:08,440
as adults and to just be creative and

759
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,920
silly and ridiculous together and I

760
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,640
thought man that's really cool I should

761
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,640
share this story I thought I should blog

762
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,319
this story I should YouTube this story I

763
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,599
should get this story out there and you

764
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:23,319

know I'm easy to

768
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,240

769
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:37,680
need to do is I need to find a way to

770
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,680

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,160
Google but they don't call me

772
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,680

773
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,680
thing people say thank God it's Friday

00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:04,400
really CU as I remember it God was

775
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,520
actually a big proponent of the six day

776
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,119
work

[Applause]

781
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,119
much I recently reread the book

782
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,200
1984 it's a fun book to read on this

783
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,160
side of

784
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,520
1984 George Orwell had some ridiculous

785
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,520
ideas

786
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,079
do you know that he supposed that by

787
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,960
this point in our history we would all

788
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,800
be speaking in some kind of hyper

789
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,200
efficient news speak I tell you what

790
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,520
when I read that I just l m AO you know

791
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:47,560
what I'm

792
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:51,319
saying I just loled and L and L and L

793
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:53,520
and L L

794
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:56,079
L it's interesting is the thing that

795
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,960
Orwell never could have foreseen is that

796
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,960
we would all go out and buy the cameras

797
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,920
ourselves and that our biggest fear

798
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,920
would be that no one's

799
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,040
watching I I really love the band Joy

800
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:16,400
Division they're one of my favorite

801
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,880
bands I really love the band new order

802
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,560
another one of my favorite bands I

803
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,400
realized recently that I actually like

804
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,520
New Order better than Joy

805
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,280
Division yeah it's troubling to me

806
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,000
makes me feel guilty because it kind of

807
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,880
feels like I'm saying that Ian Curtis

808
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,880
might have made the right

809
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,240
[Laughter]

810
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,920
decision that guy will explain the joke

811
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,920
to you after the

812
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:54,000
show I've been doing some writing I'm U

813
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,520
working on a country song I haven't

814
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,079
gotten past the title but I think it's

815
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,390
pretty darn good

816
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:05,640
it's called her safe word was

817
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:07,839
[Laughter]

818
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,319
goodbye if you know a couple of chords

819
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,160
and some words that rhyme with goodbye

820
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:12,160
hit me up after the

821
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,960
show I've writing a lot of suicide notes

822
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,400
lately

823
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:28,480
[ __ ] don't worry about me

824
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,000
bro no no no don't worry about me it's

825
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,280
just uh I think that it's an

826
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,720
underappreciated art form and I thought

827
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,760
I would take a stab at

828
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,440
it came up with one that I really like

829
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,760
it says

830
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,880
goodbye you can have my

831
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,880
records but I'm taking all my

832
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,040
pills

833
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,780
[Laughter]

834
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,760
kisses I do suffer from depression a

835
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,319
little bit I think that's thing is I'm

836
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,359
not sure if I suffer from depression or

837
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:04,920
if I'm just legitimately sad about

838
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,440
things that are perfectly valid to be

839
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,400
sad about you know like maybe I'm

840
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,359
depressed or maybe I just have this

841
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,079
creeping Sensation that I'm trapped on a

842
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,359
rock hurdling through space with a bunch

843
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,160
of people who instead of using their

844
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:17,760
resources to figure out how to get off

845
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,800
of the damn Rock are committing most of

846
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,800
their resources to blowing pieces of it

847
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,280
up that gives me a

848
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,720
sad

849
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,520
there's a lot of stuff to make you sad

850
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,319
out there I had to go and buy life

851
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,240
insurance because I have a kid and if

852
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:37,800
you're poor and you have a kid you buy

853
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,160
life insurance lest you be a

854
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,319
jerk so I go into buy life insurance and

855
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,960
I'm sitting across from the insurance

856
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:47,200
broker she's a nice lady well-dressed

857
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,760
smelled like soap and she's explaining

858
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,560
it to me and she's throwing around

859
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,839
numbers that I'm not used to I don't own

860
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,560
a house I drive a hand me- down car I

861
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:58,839
don't deal with numbers of this size

862
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,839
they're all abstract to me but as she's

863
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:03,280
throwing these numbers at me it Dawns on

864
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:07,760
me holy

865
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,319
Toledo for the first time in my life I'm

866
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,400
worth

867
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:13,640
something I sign that paper I'm actually

868
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,280
worth

869
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,280
something if I

870
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,440
die and because I have no filter I say

871
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:28,200
this out loud to

872
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,079
her and cool as it cucumber she responds

873
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,560
well suicides not covered for the first

874
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,560
48

875
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,200
months

876
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,480
whoa just tell me I can kill myself in

877
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,480
four

878
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,240
years I have 17 months

879
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
left I didn't intend to keep count that

880
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,480
was never my intention but when someone

881
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,760
tells you something like that you can't

882
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,520
help it

883
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,079
like every look at the calendar becomes

884
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,880
this really depressing thing like to me

885
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,480
now every calendar is a really morbid

886
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,480
Advent

887
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,400
calendar you peel back the date instead

888
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,240
of a piece of chocolate there's like a

889
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,240
Zoloft or

890
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,920
something but it's a depressing thing to

891
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,119
to be worth all that money if I die when

892
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,000
when your three-year-old experiences

893
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,480
death cuz the neighbor's rat dies and

894
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,160
she's exploring her own mortality and

895
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,359
she says to you Daddy I hope you never

896
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,070
die your first thought shouldn't be are

897
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:37,440
you

898
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:41,440
[Laughter]

899
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,440
sure you know you could go to

900
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,400
college I uh I do have suicidal thoughts

901
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,680
and impulses and I have since I was a

902
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,920
kid uh it happens all the time um and

903
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,599
I'll I'll tell you it's funny cuz they

904
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,520
never never happen with like the

905
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,839
legitimate heavy stuff that you would

906
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,440
think would make one want to take their

907
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,520
own life it's never because of losing

908
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,920
some job that meant a lot to me because

909
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,200
I've done that a lot uh never happens

910
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,880
because someone breaks my heart those

911
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,559
are the moments when I feel most alive I

912
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,520
know how to get on top of that stuff you

913
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,200
know it's for stupid reasons uh like

914
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,040
embarrassing myself that's the number

915
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,599
one thing that'll trigger a suicidal

916
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,240
impulse In Me Is embarrassment like if I

917
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,160
bomb in front of a comedy audience for

918
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,160
instance no pressure

919
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,480
um or if I farted a party that's a big

920
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,480
one like like it's weird that that's

921
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,599
such a huge fear to me like I have

922
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,800
actually not done some things in my life

923
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,800
that probably would have been amazing

924
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,760
because I'm like oh what if a fart you

925
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,760
know just kept me home

926
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,200
alone think of all the horrific things

927
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,599
that could happen in life it shouldn't

928
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,119

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,800

00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,440
telling us all to go [ __ ] ourselves

943
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,440
I become a

944
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,079
martyr I had a really terrible

945
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,800
embarrassment recently uh this was a

946
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,599
really bad one I I went to my

947
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,760
gastroenterologist I have a disease

948
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,520
called ulcerative colitis uh don't worry

949
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,599
about me it's managed very well thank

950
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,040
you science

951
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,599
uh but I have to go and get a finger

952
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,440
stuck up my ass a little more than I

953
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,480
might otherwise so it's not a big deal

954
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,920
you get used to it which is funny cuz

955
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,640
there was a time in my life where I

956
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,920
didn't think that that could ever be the

957
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,880
case uh when I was a kid about eight or

958
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,319
nine years old I was playing at my

959
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,400
friend Mitch's house and his dad comes

960
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:11,400
home and I say oh hey Miss uh Mr mcneel

961
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,280
how you doing and he says uh oh not good

962
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,760
Keith I said oh why is that and he said

963
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,960
the doctor just stuck his finger in my

964
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,960
ass and I said oh God

965
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,880
why to which he said to make sure I

966
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,880
don't have ass

967
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:37,319
cancer and oh the innocence of Youth I

968
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,319
said [ __ ] that I'd rather have ass

969
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:43,559
[Laughter]

970
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,480
cancer if there was a god at that moment

971
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,599
he'd be all lots of fingers up your butt

972
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,599
your

973
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,760
future so I go into my

974
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,319
gastroenterologist and I want want to be

975
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,520
mature I know it's not pleasant for him

976
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,440
either you know uh probably more

977
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,640
pleasant with me than some other people

978
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,920
that's one of those thoughts that makes

979
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,079
you feel a little bit better you're like

980
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,640
I bet I bet this isn't the worst ass he

981
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,079
has to stick a finger

982
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:15,040
in I'm not going to ask him like it's

983
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,040
nice right it's

984
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:21,240
[Applause]

985
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,680
nice I go in and we have a ritual that

986
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,880
we do he says hello we talk conspiracy

987
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,520
theories for a while he's a cool doctor

988
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,000
then he comes over and he and he feels

989
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,640
my glands and he feels under my ribs for

990
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,920
pressure and then he goes over to his

991
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,800
little table now I know when he goes

992
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,119
over to his little table that's my queue

993
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,680
and I undo my belt and I unbutton my

994
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,559
pants and I unzip my pants and I open my

995
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,960
pants up because he's getting a glove on

996
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:45,480
and getting looped up at that point

997
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,079
right only on the last occasion he turns

998
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,160
around with no glove and then sees me

999
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:50,160
and goes no no no not

1000
00:46:51,720 --> 00:47:00,119
today and then stands there and watches

1001
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,119
as I have to do the zip of

1002
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,680
Shame as if I had enthusiastically

1003
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,319
prepared and I'm now suffering from

1004
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,360
rejection from some jerk whose finger I

1005
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:17,440
didn't even want up my ass

1006
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:22,119
[Laughter]

1007
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,119
anyway doc are you allowed to prescribe

1008
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,880
zolof is that a thing you can

1009
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:33,040
do um I do know that I've been talking

1010
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,160
about a lot of depressing stuff and

1011
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,640
suicide and kind of buming you guys out

1012
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,880
but I did warn you that this was going

1013
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,880
to be a Christmas special

1014
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,599
so set a goal for myself that I wanted

1015
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:49,640
to make the most depressing Christmas

1016
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,640
special since Charlie

1017
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:57,720
Brown and that's a high

1018
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,720
bar a high bar that brilliant brilliant

1019
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:05,760
special so uh I have I I've hit a point

1020
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,160
where I I think I had a breakthrough I

1021
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,559
think I'm actually doing better than

1022
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,119
I've ever been doing in my life and

1023
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,400
here's the Breakthrough I realize what

1024
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:15,640
happened with me my life just peaked

1025
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,720
early that's the thing that happens you

1026
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,200
know your life just Peaks early and

1027
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:24,480
sometimes sometimes life goes on long

1028
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:26,559
after the thrill of living is gone to

1029
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,119
truism and I'll tell you about when my

1030
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,700
life peaked and what happened uh so when

1031
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,440
I was in the fourth

1032
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:38,559
[Laughter]

1033
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,480
grade I went out to the lunch area at my

1034
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:44,440
school and uh we used to take pieces of

1035
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,760
our pizza and throw them to the seagulls

1036
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,040
and we had this crowd of Seagulls that

1037
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,319
would always be flying over our lunch

1038
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,799
area and on this one day I go out and

1039
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:53,240
this sixth grader is standing there with

1040
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:56,640
a handful of Pebbles and he's throwing

1041
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,960
pebbles at the seagulls and what a jerk

1042
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:03,200
you know sat down eat my lunch and then

1043
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:07,480
he hit one of the seagulls and he hit it

1044
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:10,400
hard and the seagull cried have you guys

1045
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,880
ever heard a seagull cry and I don't

1046
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,760
mean that sound that they make that

1047
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,280
means hey throw me another pizza crust

1048
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:22,160
bro they make this noise this sound of

1049
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:25,040
just betrayal and sadness and I'm sorry

1050
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,520
Prince I'm sure when dobs cry it's

1051
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,520
heartbreak

1052
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,680
but this turned me inside out this is

1053
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,680
what you should have wrote the song

1054
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:40,559
about and I turn to the kid and I'm

1055
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:44,599
expecting to see remorse and instead I

1056
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:48,079
see yeah bro I got one give me five and

1057
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:52,119
he puts his hand out and at exactly that

1058
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,119
second a bird [ __ ] in his

1059
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:02,200
hand

1060
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,200
and I said oh wow that was

1061
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,680
awesome I will probably never see

1062
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,760
anything that great

1063
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,160
again

1064
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,720
damn I would have would have lik to have

1065
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,720
saved

1066
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,599
that there's this documentary about

1067
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:22,280
something they call the moonman syndrome

1068
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,000
and it's about the men that went to the

1069
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,640
moon and then came back they actually

1070
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
stood on on the surface of the Moon and

1071
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,520
looked at the Earth just a little Blue

1072
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,240
Marble floating in space and when they

1073
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,440
came back from that they were hit with

1074
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,040
the most

1075
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,880
powerful

1076
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:43,000
depression because what do you do after

1077
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,280
you've been to the moon like catch up on

1078
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,599
the dishes you know obviously have sex

1079
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,920
with a lot of people but that would get

1080
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:53,160
boring after a while I suppose I'd have

1081
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,760
to imagine

1082
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,359
uh and as they're talking to these men

1083
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,839
about this experience and they're

1084
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:01,440
zooming in on their faces and I'm

1085
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:04,720
looking at that lost expression in their

1086
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,720
eyes I

1087
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,040
thought I got you on this one I

1088
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,119
understand I once saw a bird [ __ ] on a

1089
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:18,119
sixth

1090
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,040
grader and don't get me wrong I'm not

1091
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,559
saying there haven't been amazing

1092
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,640
moments in my life cuz that would be

1093
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:27,880
wrong of me there have been in I've had

1094
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,119
insanely wonderful life I got to stand

1095
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,280
this close to the woman I love's face

1096
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,119
and watch her say those magic words I do

1097
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,200
and a short time after that I got to be

1098
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:39,799
equally close to her as our child came

1099
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,960
into the world through her body this is

1100
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:45,319
all amazing stuff but the thing that you

1101
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:48,160
have to understand is that the bird [ __ ]

1102
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:51,240
right in the middle of his goddamn Palm

1103
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,640
at exactly the right second perfectly

1104
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,359
executed Aven Revenge [ __ ] five and I

1105
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,359
was there to see it

1106
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,710
[Laughter]

1107
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,160
