your background of your research well my

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,160
my academic uh background is Berkeley I

83
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,880
I spent several years there thesis when

84
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,319
did you write the book well I finished

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,479
at the end of last year I spent about 2

86
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,000
years were you in a tight space no but

87
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,880
you know that's a very interesting

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,960
question thank you thank you and that's

89
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,680
what my book deals with human beings in

90
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,199
tight places yes yes yes I I noticed

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,479
right away here that there's some very

92
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,120
very interesting chapter names the first

93
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,880
chapter I I see here is called hard

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,280
architecture what what sort of

95
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,039
architecture do you consider to be hard

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,440
well by hard uh I don't necessarily mean

97
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,280
physically hard but um intrinsically

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,479
hard hard yes yes I think you know what

99
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,639
I mean yeah yeah yes it's the materials

100
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,840
the way things are arranged um the hard

101
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,759
bolted on things which confine the human

102
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,479
form into a natural position so so I

103
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,400
would imagine that you studied um

104
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,520
institutions um hospitals factories

105
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,800
schools yes yeah even things like like

106
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,720
airplanes there is a chapter on mass

107
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,160
transportation oh oh wow airplanes are

108
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,240
very tight and close yes they are that's

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,880
wonderful well let's let's look at some

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,840
of the examples that you have here in

111
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,639

112
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:45,080
interesting um here is um a um a picture

114
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,680
um some University buildings yes that's

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,080

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,680
claiming to write this book and you

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,280
don't know you don't even know what's in

130
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,599
it

131
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,520
well okay okay well um let's let's look

132
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,800
at some other examples here the the

133
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,000
author whoever it may be decided to

134
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,039
include some examples of an airport of

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,160
the people and the area around an

136
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,240
airport mhm you you can see how the

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,879
people the people sit apart because the

138
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,319
chairs are arranged Too Close yes right

139
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,520
that is very close and that's the main

140
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,680
problem here I don't know about you but

141
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,080
when I get home in the evening I like to

142
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,759
relax I like to loosen up I like to sit

143
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,720
back and I think most people like to do

144
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,680
that so you you went to school at

145
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,680
Berkeley yes in California yes Berkeley

146
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,159
where where did you get these ideas well

147
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
where does one get ideas how did you

148
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,280
come across these ideas of being loose

149
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
at home and comfortable well I think

150
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,680
it's just basic human nature I want to

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,800
be comfortable you think it's just basic

152
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,840
human nature to allow yourself to be

153
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,479
lazy and and loose and to actually

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,960
rearrange constructed from cement and

155
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,680
other rock hard materials mhm well an

156
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,560
airport is a very good example of all

157
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,360
the bad things the hard architecture the

158
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,719
bolted on things the um the funnels and

159
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,720
tunnels well what an airport actually is

160
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,320
it's it's a funnel you walk in and then

161
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,200
you're funneled into smaller passage

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,519
waves you you go through and you go

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,120
through you go through the orange

164
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,040
Concourse through the metal detection

165
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,640
machine through yet yet another small

166
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Passage

167
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,320
and you find that upsetting yes and

168
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,160
after that into yet one more smaller

169
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,079
tube into the airplane itself which is a

170
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,720
small tube I think airport should be

171
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,839
even smaller and more tub you walk into

172
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,000
an airport and immediately airports have

173
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,959
very very high ceilings and are very

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
very big and open yes they are very big

175
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,600
and wide and open let me when you walk

176
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,279
into an airport it should be like

177
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,880
walking in or or under or in a cave or

178
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,399
something I just don't feel like I'm

179
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,519
going in anything when I go into an

180
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
airport because it's just such a big

181
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,320
high ceiling in an open space I feel

182
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,560
like I'm still outside and I don't feel

183
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,560
safe or happy at all and for you to say

184
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,040
that airports should be less tubular and

185
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,600
and more open it's it's beyond me could

186
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,519
we go on to another

187
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,920
chapter well I'll go to another chapter

188
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,920
but it's just a waste of time go

189
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,079
ahead when the CBS building opened in

190
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,959
New York City there was a long list of

191
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,920
reg ulations governing Behavior people

192
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,440
couldn't put plants on their desks move

193
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,120
furniture or change their office without

194
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
written permission and that's an

195
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,000
experience I actually had at one point

196
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,440
it actually took two inter office memos

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,880
just to change a light bulb well I think

198
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,040
that's wonderful we need to have

199
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,440
structures in our in our buildings and

200
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,200
companies to ensure that the highest

201
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,800
amount of productivity is achieved oh no

202
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,320
the highest amount of productivity is

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,320
not achieved by all these M how can we

204
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,160
have a productive society when when

205
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,760
people are allowed to just put things on

206
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,040
their desks flowers clutter and

207
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
portraits um bags of of food and the

208
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,040
flowers will spill and things will smell

209
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,240
why don't you listen to me when when our

210
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,800
country was the most productive in in

211
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,079
the past 20 or so years we have straight

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,200
away from these hard tight settings and

213
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:55,519
we've adapted more loose LAX and lazy

214
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,079
areas to work in no wonder we've gone so

215
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,320
downhill in the past 20 years because

216
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,040
we've strayed away from this we're we're

217
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,240
working in these these these comfortable

218
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,519
loose open there's carpeting they have

219
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,519
carpeting in them and and plants and

220
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,720
