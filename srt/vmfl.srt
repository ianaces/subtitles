it's just regular yoga well maybe that's

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,520
why you can fit your own head so far up

82
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,080

83
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,199

you wouldn't like it your behavior is

85
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,520

86
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,080
take your behavior and shape it up make

87
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,600

all the time you only eat it when you're

96
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,919
stressed out which makes your BFI higher

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,840
your childhood dreams Gary wakes up
