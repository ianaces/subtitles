things that are a little edgy and it

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,959
makes me uncomfortable but that's why I

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,519
like

69
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:59,879

around the table and just talk about

73
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,400
Phil Hartman but let's start with Vicky

74
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,239
even though it's not really going around

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,239
the table because um because it's like a

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,840
bad game of musical chair yeah I love it

77
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,519
I mean obviously you worked with him for

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,440
a long time but what was your awareness

79
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,599
of him before news radio and what did

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,840
you think of him and then how did

81
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,760
meeting him totally change that okay

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,200
that's a lot and you know I as I was

83
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,680
coming here I was trying to remember you

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,840
know all the sort of pertinent things

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,319
that that happened in my life you know

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,680
parallel with Phil and you know I have

87
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,720
to say um it was my first series I came

88
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,640
I was a New Yorker so I always was on

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
the stage and I I always was doing

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879
theater and I theater's like television

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,840
but you know in front of people right

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,760
away you know I didn't real we had to

93
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,120
explain oh I'm just that's for everybody

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,959
out there who might not

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,879
understand on the Broadway I was and

96
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,599
that's and that's theater re e sing like

97
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,720
when you run out of talking you sing

98
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,439
that's why they make a music

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
right exactly but so I actually I'm

100
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,920
talking about myself already way too

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,159
much not about Phil um I sang for a

102
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,799
musical that Jim Brooks was uh producing

103
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:15,040
called I'll do anything and um it took

104
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,840
me out to LA and I got news radio while

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,359
I was out here and I had never done a

106
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,800
sitcom and I remember um we were

107
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,240
shooting the end of the pilot and Phil

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,880
and I were standing across from one

109
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,240
another and at the elevator of the set

110
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
and we were waiting for them to set the

111
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
lights and waiting for the brilliant

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,479
writers that we had to rewrite some

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,880
stuff and I looked over and I realized I

114
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,759
I'll never forget it it's so corny but I

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,039
thought I actually made it like I I'm

116
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,680
standing here with Phil Hartman and

117
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,919
something kind of Genius is happening

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,960
and you could feel it on that set you

119
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,039
could just feel it that's amazing you

120
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,759
know I mean so and I mean I could tell

121
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,720
you more and you can ask me things but I

122
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,639
mean that moment is always you know

123
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,360
illuminated in my head like a like a

124
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,919
Christmas tree ornament because it meant

125
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,360
so much to me and my life changed in

126
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,400
that very moment that night I speaking

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,720
as a fan you can feel that because there

128
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,360
are some projects that you watch um

129
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,039
where you can just feel how much people

130
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,840
are having fun sometimes they're not

131
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,840
necessarily professionals luckily they

132
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,840
had a group of people together that knew

133
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,639
how to make comedy well the thing about

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,240
the thing about news radio which is I

135
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,160
find as the years have progressed am I

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,759
you can shut me off or like

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,759
please keep talking okay so I mean the

138
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,479
thing the thing for me with news radio

139
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:41,680
that I realized um with time it's been

140
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:45,759
what 15 years yeah um or so is that we

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,400
were the writers and the actors all very

142
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,039
somewhat broken

143
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:55,280
people um and I say broken in a good way

144
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:59,759
um we were eccentric we were uh you know

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,440
uh left of center we were not you know

146
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,080
we didn't really fit in with mainstream

147
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,199
television and we really didn't fit in

148
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,080
with the world and it's interesting that

149
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,080
Paul Sims the Creator handpicked each

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,400
one of us um and we became this very

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,240
dysfunctional kind of I mean I consider

152
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,479
them all family but when you asked me

153
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:26,039
about Phil of all the people Phil to me

154
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,639
was the most grounded and was the most

155
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,800
professional and when I came in he took

156
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,280
me under his wing said this doesn't last

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,080
yeah you know it doesn't last and save

158
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,039
your money don't buy Six sports cars and

159
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,919
you know I got to write this down right

160
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,680
cuz your head I know Jeremy we talk

161
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,080
about your new pirate in a minute but I

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
don't want you to spend all your money

163
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,280
next week but um but it was an

164
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,039
interesting Dynamic I'm did he literally

165
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,000
give like that kind of advice and stuff

166
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
he gave it to me that's amazing it was

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,960
amazing it was so amazing and he would

168
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,960
sit with me and show me how to trust to

169
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,759
learn stocks and to invest my money and

170
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,520
it was interesting Dynamic to watch

171
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,039
because some people in the cast had

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,479
three cars and big houses and it got a

173
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,120
very big you know life and I I know I

174
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:17,560
thank him to this day for my Nest Egg

175
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,879
yeah you know um but he was the kind of

176
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,479
the the the stable one you know like the

177
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,240
NBA and the NFL they have like these

178
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,680
rookie symposiums to tell these guys

179
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,039
Hollywood doesn't have

180
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,120
that that's pretty cool no you're right

181
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,879
it would be a neat thing for the to do

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,080
too so let's get on them exactly i a m a

183
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,520
mentoring program I like it no but it's

184
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,800
a you know it's a cruel fate and if you

185
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,960
don't see it coming and and even with

186
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,960
that knowledge in my head and Phil going

187
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,400
it doesn't last you got to just do the

188
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,319
work you know when people are stopping

189
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,240
you and looking at you and your paycheck

190
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,199
is huge and it's just feels like crazy

191
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,599
dirty money and you know it it's hard

192
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,639
not to it's hard when it ends and it was

193
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,759
devastating when it did end I ad bet it

194
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,440
was devastating his relationship with

195
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,879
you I mean uh that just reminds me

196
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,639
because I've seen too much news radio

197
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,319
but like it reminds me of the character

198
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,479
Jimmy's relationship with Beth like a

199
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,199
same kind of Mentor teaching you stocks

200
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,639
exact same kind of thing very much well

201
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,440
and Stephen was very much a daddy too I

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,560
mean you know Phil and Stephen were kind

203
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,520
of the guide posts for me in that group

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,800
and you know that was

205
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,919
and having friends who work on the

206
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,959
show uh having friends worked on the

207
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,800
show I I probably was at 15 or 20

208
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
tapings you know in the first four years

209
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,479

210
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,680
season oh that sounds nice we have to

211
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,920
evacuate but I really have enjoyed it's

212
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,800
my pacemaker let me just let me turn it

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,839

feedback give us feedback on our

219
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,920
feedback the live podcast um uh but what

220
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
I was going to say is like the thing

221
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,000
that I remember was like even like as

222
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,920
just having friends on the set Steven

223
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,800
root and and um Phil you know they

224
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,680
treated everybody the same you know from

225
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,959
like the guy visiting to the crew to

226
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,920
whoever and and I had this image like

227
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,000
one of my images of news radio was Phil

228
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,560
and I don't know if he did this every

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,800
show but he would go up at the audience

230
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,040
during the show and stuff was that was

231
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,000
kind of his thing he'd go in and like

232
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
talk to the people in the studio

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,440
audience too and stuff you know and it's

234
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,680
like people have lines and you know bits

235
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,160
to do you don't have you know that's not

236
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,320
for everybody to do but he was that kind

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,640
of a person who would go out and he

238
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,839
after sure he loved meeting the people

239
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,640
too that was just kind of that that Phil

240
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
Hartman that you get you know out in the

241
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,040
crowd I forgot that about him I mean he

242
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,160
used to because they have these comics

243
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,640
on sitcoms not So Much Anymore um warm

244
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,320
because it's cruel really who hold the

245
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,839
audience hostage and try to keep them

246
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,880
laughing and Phil would see it dying and

247
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,200
would you know wake them back up for the

248
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,760
good of the right cu the audience would

249
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,800
love that you know one impression and

250
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,640
stuff would walk out in that audience

251
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,120
right now and talk to them boom right

252
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,519
picked up so much right now if I see

253
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,680

again being a fan of the show and being

264
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,120
a fan of everybody was on it you know uh

265
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,120
news R was just it for me as somebody

266
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,200
who now like works out here and has a

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,519
pilot all right all right what's the

268
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,240
name of that pil what's the name of that

269
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,200
J called Aspen

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,600
network I just got it yesterday have no

273
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,200
information crazy mismatched with on the

274
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,519
show playing a talking cat that has

275
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,959
magical powers love that that's great

276
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,639
and it's you know it's what you think

277
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm not going to ruin

278
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:15,639
it it's like a modern-day sort of cereal

279
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,320
Citizen Cane Meats water shipped down

280
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,040
well I don't I have no I don't know I

281
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,639
got descri it as a simple comedy I was

282
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,399
going to say something nice and now

283
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,760
we've gotone all this horrible tangent

284
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,880
um no but no as a fan of news radio

285
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,040
because I can see it it's coming through

286
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,959
him and I see it as well but you know

287
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,160
when I see now that they give away you

288
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,200
know SAG Awards and em like to for best

289
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,120
Ensemble sometimes that's the first show

290
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,120
I always think of yeah because I've

291
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,760
never seen a group of people who I mean

292
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,839
like literally at the beginning it just

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,320
like I don't know how this is going to

294
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,279
work and then after the third episode

295
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,839
you wondered how it ever wouldn't work

296
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,120
well and what's interesting is you know

297
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,959
I was in the pilot only to be in the

298
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,680
pilot I was written and I had two lines

299
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,560
I believe and so I that's why I picked

300
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,279
up the chewing gum right because I sat

301
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,480
out there in that freaking break room

302
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,880
for so long where they were doing all

303
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
the scenes I was like I got to come up

304
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,480
with something and my line in the pilot

305
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,160
literally was coffee day so I took the

306
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,760
chewing gum and I can make this annoying

307
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,760
popping sound with it so I it started to

308
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,639
become a thing and you know what was

309
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,040
great is that Jimmy Burrows sort of

310
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,480
latched onto those things that we found

311
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,320
and kept it going but um wow I lost my

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,920
train of thought I'm very old so sad

313
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,760
really wow just the

314
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,079
no it was it was a you know we would we

315
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,279
got close very T very quickly um at the

316
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:40,680
rap of the first six I believe we all

317
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,600
didn't want to leave one another's side

318
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,920
and I believe it toyed with all of our

319
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,680
personal lives um to be honest I know it

320
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,040
did um and we went we were drinking and

321
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,880
and partying on the set and in the

322
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,079
dressing rooms and the sun started to

323
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,360
come up and I remember the writers you

324
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,240
know Josh Lee who I adore and all these

325
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,160
guys Al Hig and and they put foil on the

326
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,880
Windows they covered the window they did

327
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,720
because the light was our enemy and we

328
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,240
would when we had nowhere else to sort

329
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,720
of hang out and the light was coming in

330
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,519
they were like we went to Paul SIMS

331
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
house and somebody said where can we go

332
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,680
to keep on drinking and hanging out and

333
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,320
I said Vegas right and so they're like

334
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,440
yes and so at like 1100 a.m. you know in

335
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,440
the morning we're sweating like

336
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,760
rapists you know what I mean like

337
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,480
waiting like I'm not high anymore this

338
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,600
isn't Fun you know but we and we Up in

339
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,880
Vegas and I remember coming

340
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,760
home little thankfully we wouldn't get

341
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,880
in the car but you know I remember

342
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,760
coming home like 2 Days Later I'd never

343
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,959
been that person who just you know and

344
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,760
it became very just clicky and strange

345
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:48,440
and I think part of the reason we were

346
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,720
never nominated for

347
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,800
Stu is because we would go to Awards

348
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,360
like we were banned from the SAG Awards

349
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,079
now when I say we I recall the evening

350
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,959
of Steven Rood and myself sitting

351
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,079
perfectly you know normally at the table

352
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:09,720
but Andy decided to ask for Helen Hunt's

353
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,800
autograph on his dick so it was stuff

354
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,440
like that you know it got a little there

355
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,279
was certain elements that would get and

356
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,560
so we were banned you know and we didn't

357
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,759
act as a group right ever anywhere it

358
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,959
wasn't possible you know so I I think

359
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,120
that's we scared people even even Phil

360
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,519
because I mean I don't know you talk

361
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,720
about him as an anchor but that just

362
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,320
that blows me away that he would still

363
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,880
be that kind of a crazy person Phil was

364
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,920
not part of that no he wasn't he was his

365
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,240
own thing he was he was absolutely not

366
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,759
in that and Stephen rot was not really

367
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:49,320
uh so much of it was mainly myself Paul

368
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:54,160
Sims Dave Andy of Mora and uh and Brad

369
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:57,639
Isaac's and Josh Lee and Joe say Vegas

370
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,959
Joe no but Joe the writer Joe I love

371
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:05,160
name foret Joe red hair Joe one man news

372
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,880
radio Jesus Christ we're old Joe Fury no

373
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,440
Joe Fury yes Joe Fury right Joe Fury we

374
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,519
became a nucleus yeah and within that

375
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,079
we're you know and then I saned out a

376
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,639
little bit you know it was hard to keep

377
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,399
it up yeah um and I think it took a toll

378
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,480
on all all of our relationships and

379
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,600
marriages at the time um as you will

380
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,800
have probably read in the Press yes

381
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,880
right yes and what one one other thing

382
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,199
that I do say in in in kind of

383
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,120
heartbreaking way

384
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,240
is that at the time of news radio I

385
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,360
lived with Nick

386
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:42,759
Noti and Phil lived with with Bren MH

387
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:46,720
and they were both people in the darkest

388
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:49,040
part of their disease yeah and it was

389
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,160
heartbreaking and I think that Phil and

390
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,160
I had a bond around it because we

391
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,399
thought that we could save the people

392
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,399
that we loved so Des would make things

393
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,759
better yes and we were not able to do so

394
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,040
and you know I will never forget we went

395
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,160
to the Golden Globe Awards and I brought

396
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,319
Nick and he brought Bren and they were

397
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,800
both sober uh Nick was sober when I met

398
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,920
him um on I'll do anything and she was I

399
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,800
guess sober I don't didn't really follow

400
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,800
you know it wasn't my business and they

401
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,920
both began to drink they got together

402
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,680
and Phil and I looked at each other and

403
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,360
I thought my life is over like I we were

404
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,480
so worried and um towards the end you

405
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,160
never knew with Phil but towards the end

406
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,319
of that that

407
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,199
season he came in a couple of

408
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:43,279
times without having shaved which for

409
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:47,079
him was was unheard of and not late but

410
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,920
worn and had slept on the boat and was

411
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,720
you know calling hospitals when his kids

412
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,319
weren't brought home and it had gotten

413
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,079
to that place that we all know it got to

414
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:58,959
and I remember he said to me how do you

415
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,800
do this yeah and I made up some

416
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,959
ridiculous thing I had convinced myself

417
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,400
that my relationship was going to be

418
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:10,160
okay or I just wasn't you know handling

419
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,959
it and when he was killed you

420
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:18,679
know I my relationship went all the way

421
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,919
down and I left the business for two

422
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,439
years and I left Nick you know at that

423
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,480
time and I'd been there 10 years you

424
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,520
know and I I feel like I got out before

425
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,400
the boat sank and

426
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,440
how I dealt with Phil's death was all I

427
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,039
could do was write so I locked myself

428
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,120
away on that Hiatus after he was killed

429
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,760
and I had all these literary Martyrs who

430
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,679
I loved my entire life Dorothy Parker

431
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,840
and Salinger and you know all these

432
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,799
great writers and Tennesse Williams and

433
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,799
and I just sat down and wrote about 24

434
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,880
songs and produced a record called East

435
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,640
of midnight which is out but I don't say

436
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,600
it for that reason but that's a that was

437
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,240
a journal for me of of how to walk

438
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,520
through that and I actually that album

439
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,280
was a premonition of what what came

440
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,400
which was my relationship just it nearly

441
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,760
killed me you know and so um I always

442
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,000
felt Kindred with with Phil for that

443
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,880
reason sure you know because you you

444
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,919
can't save the people that you love

445
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,799
sometimes right of of all the things you

446
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,320
know that resulted from his death you

447
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,799
know I feel like if the show had already

448
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,080
ended and it you know and like what had

449
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,360
happened happened years later I I feel

450
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,200
like that it was like almost like a a

451
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,400
God sent to his fans that you know you

452
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,240
guys got to do a farewell show you know

453
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,880
because it was to Phil Hartman you know

454
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
even though you know it it was his

455
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,679
character and then you know that had

456
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,880
happened at least on the Hiatus so you

457
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,919
guys had some time to process cuz could

458
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,360
you imagine that was like a weekend off

459
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,880
and you know obviously there's no way to

460
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,760
come back the next week and shoot a show

461
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,440
or anything they so there was a if I

462
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,200
remember it was like August I'm not sure

463
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,799
you know so there was like weeks or

464
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,880
months or whatever to get ready and all

465
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,080
too cuz well and I and I you know none

466
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,720
of us wanted to come back yeah we really

467
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,480
didn't want to keep going sure and um

468
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,919
and I also never forget this this is

469
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,080
going to sound all made up like it's on

470
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,640
ghost hunters or something but you know

471
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,080
I was asleep and the day the morning the

472
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,840
news came out Nick woke me and he had a

473
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,120
look on his face and I remember I sat up

474
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,200
and I said it's Phil like I I just

475
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,320
somehow oh wow I just somehow it was so

476
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,240
strange to me but um we didn't want to

477
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,760
come back and you know John love it's is

478
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,360
the reason I believe that Phil got on

479
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,120
Saturday Night Live Phil's a graphic

480
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,720
designer as we all know John sort of

481
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,280
dragged him in and got him seen and he

482
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,600
was on there and so you know we thought

483
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,799
that that choice made sense but it was

484
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,039
never the same and it wasn't John's

485
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,520
fault you couldn't blame him for it no

486
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,360
there some some of my favorite episodes

487
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,520
in that season are actually or from the

488
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,600
show are actually from That season um

489
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,440
you know it's it's you know we we you

490
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,400
know

491
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,480
obviously there's there's no denying

492
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,159
what a huge impact that death had on

493
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,240
people who knew him yeah obviously I

494
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,799
never met him he's the reason I wanted

495
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
to get into voice over and in into

496
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,200
acting the first he's the first

497
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,159
celebrity that ever mattered to me was

498
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,840
lost you know and um and that's just

499
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,880
mostly because everything he did was so

500
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,200
full of joy at least on camera you know

501
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,039
what I mean and I just wanted to talk

502
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,559
about what made him so funny that's just

503
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,840
so important to me I mean and Jeremy you

504
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,200
and I have talked about that episode of

505
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,760
Saturday Night Live that I mean it's I

506
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,760
mean you know for me I mean it's it's

507
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,440
like with any great performer any great

508
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,880
comedian and because I you again I don't

509
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,799
think you can call him a comedian he's

510
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,520
just a brilliant actor and he just was

511
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,039
really good at comedy and it comes down

512
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,120
to what Edmond Keane always said you

513
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:42,760
know like dying is easy comedy is hard

514
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,960
and Phil for whatever reason made it

515
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,799
look effortless everything he did was so

516
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,000
clean and specific you know I I mean and

517
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,679
and you can talk about bits he did from

518
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,640
Saturday Night Live I mean I can talk

519
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,559
about you know even just one line as a

520
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,159

and he just there's nothing sloppy about

523
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,840
anything he did he was he was just a

524
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,880
quintessential professional as as an

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,720
perfectly through the whole thing and

542
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,760
they ask the innocuous questions like oh

543
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,799
the first topic is um bread what do we

544
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,360
think of bread bread good and then Tanto

545
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,080
bread good and Frankie time bread good

546
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,279
you know I mean it just and then when it

547
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,159
comes to the end and you know it's

548
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,919
coming again fire bad the second time

549
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,080
after talking about like trade unions in

550
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,760
the West Indies you know after fire good

551
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,760
fire bad a little bit of condescension

552
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,159
and it comes to the end and you know

553
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,880
it's coming and he freaks out and

554
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,840
punches a hole through the wall up stage

555
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
and leaves and I mean it's the only time

556
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,120
I ever saw him crack in anything and it

557
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,440
was like the most effective thing I have

558
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,400
because again how are you going to end

559
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,679
it it was like the ending it was like

560
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,840
ending um uh um sorry Billy Wilder um uh

561
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,840
movies the the Something Like It Hot you

562
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,080
know like like nobody's perfect it's

563
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,559
like they didn't think that was going to

564
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,760
be the end line but it had to be you

565
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,799
know what I mean and like it just yeah I

566
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,880
I just I love watching everything he did

567
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,919
even the small like Sergeant Bilo he's

568
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,640
great in oh yeah I am probably the only

569
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,880
person to put those English words

570
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,520
together in that sense it's true it is

571
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,960
but yeah I just everything he did was

572
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,600
just you know and again as somebody

573
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,240
watching him as a young person watching

574
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,600
him on TV it was he was somebody to

575
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,919
steal everything from abely you know I

576
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,039
mean and it was just inflections or

577
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,000
takes or whatever it was and yeah and I

578
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,039
would just would have loved to have seen

579
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
him do zap ranig again on future

580
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,880
God just would have loved to have seen

581
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,400
that but I mean there's no doubt that I

582
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,919
love Billy West don't get me wrong and I

583
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
think everybody on the show is great for

584
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,559
I mean everybody's great but to see to

585
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,200
have him do that would have been oh just

586
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,400
pretty damn good impression Billy West

587
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,480
does though

588
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,279
oh oh yeah he's amazing he's amazing but

589
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,760
Mike was the first thing or at least the

590
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,120
most the thing that first hit you I

591
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,320
think so much of America just remembers

592
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,600
him from satday Night Live and just you

593
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,600
know they you read all the things they

594
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,880
called them the glue there story that in

595
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,880
a room and they start

596
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,440
going and some of the things that I

597
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,360
thought was I I watched some interviews

598
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,320
with him he did like a later with GRE

599
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,279
caner that's on YouTube it's fairly

600
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,480
because you just want to kind of hear

601
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,080
his side of things because you never

602
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,480
know these stories you hear you know

603
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,200
which they are and that you know the he

604
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,200
says in the mid 70s you know went to see

605
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,400
the Groundlings and he talks about

606
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,559
himself coming into acting later in life

607
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
and then like about to quit too because

608
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,600
sure he had the little falling out with

609
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,120
Paul Rubin over you know things that

610
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,760
happened on PeeWee Herman and all he was

611
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,760
about to quit and ended up on satday

612
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,480
Night Live and it's just when I think of

613
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,400
things you know so many people peg him

614
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,440
as Bill Clinton was as big and he was

615
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,760
hilarious but I wonder how much he got

616
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,120
sick of that because you know you want

617
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,360
to walk in the room every time and go

618
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,159
come on do Bill Clinton because I love

619
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,440

636
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,679

637
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,080

here just so you right uh but no and

642
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,840
then there's one other thing that I just

643
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,399
um yeah no I just yeah and Phil is

644
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
amazing but the first thing because I

645
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,159
just want to jump back to that the first

646
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,120
thing that I ever remember seeing him in

647
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,159
or like remembering it was him yeah was

648
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,399
watching peewee's Playhouse the original

649
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,880
on HBO when they showed it the live

650
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:28,919
action the the the one for adults you

651
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,200
know shoir you know like that one uh and

652
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,960
they had the s in the Family Stone

653
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,240
medley and it was amazing but the the

654
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,480
one thing and I'll never forget it was

655
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,760
when he came on as Captain Carl and the

656
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,960
best thing is is you don't even get a

657
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,200
look at him because he runs immediately

658
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,039
enters and then runs off stage cuz he

659
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,240
said he has to use the bathroom so you

660
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,399
don't even get a look at him he's like

661
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,919
excuse me and he's gone right so you're

662
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:50,799
waiting for this guy to come back and he

663
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,000
finally does and it's it's the line that

664
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,559
I'll never forget and it's got this

665
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,120
brilliant physical bit his he comes up

666
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,039
to him and says wait a minute Captain

667
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,159
Carl did you wash your hands and he goes

668
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:02,320
no

669
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,120
oh and just take and covers his eyes

670
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,679
nose and mouth and then they sing a song

671
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,559
about you know Sailors washing their

672
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,840
hands and it's and and I just sat there

673
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,520
with my mouth open going like that is

674
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,240
the funniest thing anyone could ever do

675
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,960
and yeah and again it was just it was

676
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,360
just perfectly done you know and when I

677
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,399
found out that he had written so much of

678
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,200
it you know was responsible for that

679
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:25,200
good when peewee's big adventure came

680
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,919
out I went and saw that instantly and

681
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,240
then again when I found out he was

682
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,640
responsible it was you know everything I

683
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,679
find out about him it's just it adds to

684
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,440
it how about for you Jason your first

685
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,559
Phil Hartman and it's hard because I

686
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,080
know I saw him on on SNL a bunch but I

687
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,480
have hated most of SNL since the mid 80s

688
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,760
and so I wasn't really paying attention

689
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,279
to it um but I did I thought you were G

690
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,840
to say but I hated him I I don't know

691
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:54,320
why we're doing this actually I have no

692
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,720
IDE me no I did not like a lot of SNL at

693
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,000
the time so he stood out he always stood

694
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,520
out there's no doubt so I knew exactly

695
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,760
who he was but when I started hearing

696
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,399
him on The Simpsons I think Troy McClure

697
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,960
just again that was like the epitome of

698
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:09,039
smarm and again that's what's attracted

699
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,720
me so long for to him so much and yeah

700
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,000
there are people laughing in the

701
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,000
audience who know why um just because of

702
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,440
my personality but he I uh once I saw

703
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,600
him on on news radio sort of embodying

704
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,320
that like that was the thing that just

705
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,399
killed me because he's one of those

706
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,919
classic I was almost like executive

707
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,799
smart you know like Eddie isard is an

708
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,799
executive trans you know what I mean had

709
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,080
this kind of you know absolutely yeah

710
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,480
yeah it was dignified and it was it was

711
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,080
filtered through something else you know

712
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,919
because he was a good actor and you know

713
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,200
the the good actor acting made him a

714
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,919
great comedic actor he um I'm just

715
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,480
trying to think I totally forgot what

716
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,440
the hell say first thing first thing

717
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,760
first thing what first sketch Satur live

718
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,720
or that you like that that you remember

719
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,840

00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,840
bit set up your bit okay well basically

769
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,120
um uh I was I was able to talk to to

770
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,159
Melanie hudel who of course played Jan

771
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,559
Brady and um Tor spelling on Saturday

772
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,399
Night Live While Phil was there and uh

773
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,000
she wanted to be here today but

774
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,399
unfortunately had things to do with uh

775
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,880
the family but she did write this so

776
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,399
that I could read it for her um and it's

777
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,760
it's just it's great I don't need to set

778
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,120
it up any more than that um this is so

779
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,880
Melanie hudle on Phil Harman I don't

780
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,480
think I've ever been quite as nervous as

781
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,360
I was when I auditioned for Saturday

782
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,440
Night Live it was the first of many

783
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,880
outof body experiences I would have over

784
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,080
the course of the three years I was on

785
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,600
the show I didn't realize that not only

786
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,320
Lauren and other producers would be

787
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,279
watching the audition but lots of cast

788
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,159
members as well when it was time for me

789
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,120
to perform my Jan Brady impression I

790
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,480
needed somebody to play Mike Brady and I

791
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,080
asked Phil if would do it he said I

792
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,360
would love to be Mike Brady but I think

793
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,080
it would be better if I read it from

794
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,080
offstage so that all eyes will be on you

795
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,640
well at that point on the one hand you

796
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,159
know he had a point but on the other

797
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,320
hand I really really went against the

798
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,720
plan I'd had in mind for weeks but the

799
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,840
overriding feeling was oh my god I've

800
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,840
been watching this guy since college and

801
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,240
I can't believe I'm standing in his

802
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,080
presence oh my God he eventually

803
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,799
convinced me and it turned out to be the

804
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,360
right move it was a very thoughtful and

805
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,720
generous gesture coming from a fellow

806
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,639
actor and I've never forgotten it that

807
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,279
first interaction that we had during the

808
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:02,559
audition pretty much set the course for

809
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:04,240
our relationship over the next 3 years

810
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,720
he was always stopping by my office just

811
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,760
to talk and he gave me a lot of really

812
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,600
great advice it has been said that he

813
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,320
was the glue during those years not only

814
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,240
in his ability to play the Everyman

815
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,639
roles but also bringing our group

816
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,000
together behind the scenes as well I

817
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:19,480
remember that every time he would walk

818
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,279
into a room everybody would start

819
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,200
chanting in the lowest register of their

820
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,639
voices

821
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,159
GL he cared about everybody and was a

822
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:29,639
true team player I do remember one time

823
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,519
he expressed to me that he really missed

824
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:34,320
working with Jan Hooks and and she

825
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:35,679
understands why they had such a great

826
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,960
chemistry together but he certainly

827
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,399
didn't let this slow him down she felt

828
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,840
very lucky to be in the presence of

829
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,360
somebody working at the top of their

830
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,440
game especially knowing how kind and

831
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,840
giving he was behind the scenes uh

832
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,000
Melanie has been part of a Facebook

833
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,679
campaign to help get Phil a

834
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,960
much-deserved star on either the

835
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,039
Hollywood or Canadian Walk of Fame why

836
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,440
not both yeah and I really do hope that

837
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,720
it happens and this is what she wrote uh

838
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,039
just to end up I miss Phil the world

839
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,880
misses Phil but thankfully he was able

840
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,600
to use his talents in such a way that he

841
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,559
left behind quite a body of work that

842
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,320
will continue to make people laugh for

843
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,559
years and years and years that's nice

844
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,559

919
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,760
was a lifetime of first Phil you know

920
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,359
like just about everything I did in life

921
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,400
I did with Phil you know because we were

922
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,280
so close and Age and and he had to

923
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,680
babysit me a lot so

924
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,119

925
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,280

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,839
you know we things like that you know

927
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,240
and uh he was also one of the first acts

928
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,280
I ever booked when I was a baby agent

929
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,000
you know I I got him some of his first

930
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:51,880
gigs you know and uh things like that so

931
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,960
it it it was just a long line of first

932
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,839
you know and that's kind kind of how I

933
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:01,400
look at Phil is uh he uh was set a

934
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:04,680
Renaissance going in me you know and and

935
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,839
uh and it has again you know even with

936
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,880
with him being gone so it's uh it's one

937
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,560
of those things you know it's like two

938
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,800
projects I'm working on that are

939
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,160
animation projects are based on original

940
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,160
artwork Phil did that's awesome and

941
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,119
we're now five years into that process

942
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:27,359
and about to do the pilots so it's it's

943
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,640
uh it's kind of like uh you know the

944
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,200
last time I saw Phil was the night our

945
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,880
father died and uh and Phil and I talked

946
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,839
and and he said you know someday we'll

947
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,200
do something together and uh and I look

948
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:46,359
at these things and and like getting him

949
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:50,280
at stars as um the a dream and a promise

950
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:52,560
right sure and so that that's how I I'm

951
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,599

960
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,920
influences were if you had something to

too yeah yeah he does he he he doesn't

1022
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,079
look dissimilar very much uh you want to

1023
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,880
just read all your notes for the rest of

1024
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,960
the show that's what you can do really

1025
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,880
since you took so many damn notes

1026
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,040
actually we went we went over everything

1027
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,440
for making me look like yeah that's it

1028
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,400
um actually the only other thing that I

1029
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,960
had on here that I even wanted to

1030
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,640
mention cuz I thought it was interesting

1031
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,520
but apparently he auditioned to be the

1032
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,720
announcer on the prices right did he

1033
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,280
really yeah and and Rod Rody or whoever

1034
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,359
it is got it instead of him I know isn't

1035
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,599
that crazy show business makes no it's

1036
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,240
insane I mean like could you imagine

1037
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,079
Phil Hartman showing up and being the MC

1038
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,920
for something and going no no you know

1039
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,040
what that's wrong I can't even imagine

1040
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,000
that you get to the point where you

1041
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,800
don't just offer him that like I go to

1042
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,880
appointment sometimes as you do I'm sure

1043
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,480
and you're just sitting there and it's

1044
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,440
like There's Tom Arnold and pet there'sa

1045
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,160
man and why are they bringing people

1046
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:38,280
know aware what part are all those

1047
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,319
people auditioning for that's what I

1048
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,240
want that's like I wonder who will get

1049
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:46,800
it it's for the Morgan Fair child story

1050
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,119
exactly I know how did she get a story I

1051
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,560
don't I don't know she was auditioning

1052
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,200
for it actually Morgan Fair brought her

1053
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,720
in I was like this is so unfair I'm sure

1054
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,800
we've all had that at one time but like

1055
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,319
I had a we want a Vicky Lewis type for a

1056
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,319
voice over but I didn't get it yes uh in

1057
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,000
fact actually didn't get it that's the

1058
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,280
uh my uh my father told me actually but

1059
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,520
before I started to do this horrible

1060
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,599
thing my father told me the four stages

1061
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,040
of the actor's career and actually

1062
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,440
Martin mole until death gave me the

1063
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,839
fifth which I didn't know there was one

1064
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,079
but the four stages of the actor's

1065
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,200
career if I remember correctly is who's

1066
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:26,680
Jeremy gusin two get me Jeremy guskin

1067
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:29,480
three we need a young Jeremy guskin four

1068
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,119
who's Jeremy gusin and then of course

1069
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,280
five that uh Martin mole told me was

1070
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,599
you'll never hear what happened to

1071
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,119
Jeremy

1072
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:40,119
G so uh so yeah so I mean like that I

1073
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,040
think is that's the full cycle so I try

1074
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,720
to remember that no matter what you know

1075
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,200
no I like it when I go in and they're

1076
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,119
like we're so I can't believe you came

1077
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,480

stupid um speaking of Pilot's licensees

1124
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,160
Phil Hartman had a pilot's license back

1125
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,599
to Phil to be honest with you I think I

1126
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,760
could literally just talk about things

1127
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,440
I've seen him in for a good four to

1128
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,520
seven hours sure to I'm serious because

1129
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,119
I mean like again you know like there's

1130
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,839
so many things he did that I remember

1131
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,280
almost verbatim you know because and

1132
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:50,400
they were just you know like when on Sat

1133
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,200
Night Live when he used to play that

1134
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,800
crazy waiter with the was like hello you

1135
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,720
know you take a nothing part and make it

1136
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,760
into something uh

1137
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,240
the anal retentive

1138
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,640
Chef it's always hilarious well first we

1139
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,000
fold this up then you like then you take

1140
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,319
the refere you put that in a bag then

1141
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,760
you took the refu baggie and put it in

1142
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,839
another bag they run out of time for the

1143
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,319
show cuz the very first time he like

1144
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,960
would cut off a piece of something he'd

1145
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:15,760
have to wrap put in a trash bag and

1146
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,000
stuff and like there was and that was

1147
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,240
the character he didn't need to put on

1148
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,640
any physicality or a voice or anything

1149
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,000
it was all in just the setup it and also

1150
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,359
I remember in news radio I mean the he

1151
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,760
never rehearsed I mean I guess at a

1152
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:30,240
certain point none of us needed to we

1153
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,400
knew who our characters were but there

1154
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,440
was a Cadence and the stakes were so

1155
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,960
high and so

1156
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,200
real I to this day I don't know why it

1157
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,559
was as funny as it was it was something

1158
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:46,559
innately it's just a gift at a certain

1159
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,160
point I me I don't know I can't I mean I

1160
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,720
I think it comes from and almost it

1161
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,440
might be easier from an outside

1162
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,520
perspective especially on this but you

1163
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,880
know I've always heard that good

1164
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,760
directing is 90% casting and you cannot

1165
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,400
ask for a better cast than all of you

1166
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,880
and regardless of whether or not you

1167
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,760
know it was the right amount of right

1168
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,480
people for the right whatever it was it

1169
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,440
all worked because you guys were all so

1170
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,000
good together when you get good actors

1171
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,240
you don't need to have great material

1172
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,839
even as long as you're talking and

1173
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,040
listening to One Another when you have

1174
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,359
funny people or intelligent people you

1175
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,599

never understood and Ray would make me

1203
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,559
die laughing because he and I had

1204
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,559
nothing to do right so it's like they

1205
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:31,520
gave I had a piece of gum in the pilot

1206
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,480
and he had like a tool right and we're

1207
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,359
like who the [ __ ] are we right and we're

1208
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,760
trying to figure it out and he would say

1209
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,240
to me he said it to me I think once or

1210
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,240
twice like I they going to fire me like

1211
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,319
I really don't know what I'm doing and I

1212
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,000
remember saying stop saying that you

1213
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:45,000
know but that didn't they couldn't find

1214
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,839

1215
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,119
C right and so then we had a second guy

1216
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,680

00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,720
what made the show great and it also you

1254
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,160
know not a dysfunction but you know

1255
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,599
there there was creativity there that's

1256
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,200
what you get with creative people you

1257
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,680
know wild no work to do the show and the

1258
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,520
writer started writing like really uh at

1259
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,520
the middle of year 1 they we began at

1260
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,160
like 2 a.m. and we'd get like this many

1261
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,000
pages at noon they'd be warm you'd be

1262
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,200
like okay but it was always genius I

1263
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,640
mean you know and I go on certain shows

1264
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,440
today that I just I'm kind of like where

1265
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,640
where have you put the writers where you

1266
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:46,040
know where are those guys where is Brad

1267
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,200
isic where is Josh Lee and and they're

1268
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,160
all working and they're around but you

1269
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,040
know that was a time when writers got an

1270
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,280
18 million deal you know and writers

1271
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,640
were I think the driver right I mean

1272
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,200
they were the driving force and

1273
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,000
something happened that's

1274
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,040
unexplainable where you know it's

1275
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,720
Network you know like like the network

1276
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,520
did very little with that show you to

1277
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,520
touch to touch news radio they were

1278
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,559
there and the production company was

1279
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,799
there but but but you know it was it was

1280
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,480
so it was Paul you know calling the

1281
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,119
writers in at you know 1 in the morning

1282
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,960
and stuff you know there was no network

1283
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,040
there and I don't all all the shows I

1284
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,359
know of now are all like kind of N9 to5

1285
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,160
you know kind of and I mean there's

1286
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:30,160
wonderful writers out there I mean I

1287
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,760
have a recurring part on How I Met Your

1288
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,760
Mother and those writers are kind of

1289
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,640
Genius you know I was I was so thrilled

1290
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,319
to see that writing they're out there

1291
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:41,040
but it's like reality television came in

1292
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:43,319
or something and the bar got changed and

1293
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,680
I don't know what happened you know

1294
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:48,040
although it feels very you know hopeful

1295
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:53,799
that we have modern family and that we

1296
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:58,640
have you know Aspen yeah and as exactly

1297
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:58,640
exactly yeah say the

1298
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:04,119
coming this fall now I'd like to read a

1299
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,400
little

1300
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:08,680
poetry as far as your acting Jeremy what

1301
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,160
do you ever feel anything coming out

1302
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,079
you're like holy [ __ ] I just did a

1303
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,480
little Phil Hartman yeah every time I do

1304
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,359
any voiceover anything yeah anytime

1305
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,559
anything anything what specifically do

1306
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:21,280
you do voiceover wise what kind of

1307
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,920
things do you get cast for I mean I mean

1308
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,079
it's I mean it can be anything you know

1309
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,119
it's I mean one of the things that I

1310
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,599
love doing is is cartoon voices and one

1311
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:29,559
of the reasons I love doing it is

1312
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,880
because Phil Hartman was one of those

1313
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,799
people who you know let me know and I

1314
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,599
mean I grew up with you know like those

1315
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:37,880
ones in the 80s you know like gi. Joe

1316
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,319
and Transformers and like all that stuff

1317
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,119
and you know and a cartoon voice was ah

1318
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,760
Megatron you know I mean and like that

1319
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,599
was a big cartoony voice and you know

1320
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,319
like to see Phil go on The Simpsons and

1321
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,920
you know you know make that almost sort

1322
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:54,480
of like stylized 1930s thing acceptable

1323
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,839
to do for something you know and again

1324
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,599
you know like cartoon voices are always

1325
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,640
about stealing from something you know

1326
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,880
it's you know you look at all the

1327
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,599
Simpson voices and they're stolen from

1328
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,400
some else it's like you know like it's

1329
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:05,920
so nice to see American Dad that Paul

1330
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,400
Lind is working again you know what I

1331
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,359
mean like in things like that you know I

1332
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,520
mean and and you see that and it's great

1333
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,839
because you got a whole new generation

1334
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:16,680
of people who you get too exposed to it

1335
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:19,520
and Phil was he was just so good at

1336
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,680
locking in on something in a voice that

1337
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,040
was exactly it but made it his own it's

1338
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,160
like J Moore doing Christopher Walkin

1339
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,640
it's like when people do Christopher

1340
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,480
Walkin they don't do Chris Walkin they

1341
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,960
do him doing it you know and it was like

1342
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,760
people doing Clinton or doing Frank

1343
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,960
Sinatra in the 80s they weren't doing

1344
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,720
that they were doing Phil doing it and I

1345
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,640
think when you've taken something that

1346
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:43,160
everybody knows and have basically bent

1347
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:46,040
it to your own will that's a type of

1348
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:48,040
skill and a type of just Artistry and

1349
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,720
genius that you don't find very often I

1350
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,200
think you said that really beautifully I

1351
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,839
think that Phil you know didn't

1352
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,720
necessarily have the soul of an actor

1353
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:58,880
and it made him a great actor because he

1354
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,359
was almost too smart and levelheaded to

1355
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,240
be an actor and that's and that's

1356
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:04,160
literally it and one of the last quotes

1357
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,280
you know that I saw of his that that

1358
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,720
really struck home for me is that I mean

1359
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,839
he was in his 50s and for all intents

1360
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,760
and purposes by my book he had made it

1361
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,319
you know like he was getting film work

1362
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,240
and I mean like you know definitely not

1363
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:18,400
top but second or third and that's the

1364
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,079
best position to be in because if it

1365
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,920
tanks it's not your fault you know I

1366
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,400
mean he was in a great position he

1367
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,200
always did a and he always did good work

1368
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,880
the crime to me I mean

1369
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,520
that's you

1370
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:36,720
know was that he was so pure in his

1371
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:40,200
motive in life you know and he was

1372
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,799
always working he yes and you know what

1373
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:47,559
kind of broke my heart about that scene

1374
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:50,480
that night was what I knew was that he

1375
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:52,920
had made an emotional decision to stop

1376
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,000
that if it if it wasn't going to you

1377
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,079
know he was he was tired right and you

1378
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,480
know I believe she called him three

1379
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,359
times and he hung up right you know and

1380
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:09,040
I like to you know I I think he probably

1381
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:12,640
was saying no right he BR right finally

1382
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:15,000
but you know he just was sleep he went

1383
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,640
to sleep you know I just he had cold

1384
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,559
medicine in his toxicology report if I'm

1385
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,640
not mistaken you know and I just I just

1386
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,160
think what an awful permanent solution

1387
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,400
to a temporary problem which is leads me

1388
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,240
to guns and I won't even go there you

1389
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,000
know had there not been a gun in that

1390
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:36,480
house he might be sitting here today you

1391
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,599
know and you know F your kids yeah yeah

1392
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,880
you know that's it you know yeah and

1393
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,680
that was it you know and then it's just

1394
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,799
he was he was that quintessential

1395
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,520
professional it was you know even though

1396
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:48,240
you be the top of his game he never

1397
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,200
thought that he was there he was always

1398
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,880
humble enough and smart enough to know

1399
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,440
that he had to keep working yeah and he

1400
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,760
knew it was temporary know he knew that

1401
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,240
well of course he did I mean because he

1402
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,720
said to me it doesn't I me and he used

1403
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,440
to sit at his bill mcneel desk and draw

1404
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,480
awesome all of his you know and I it's

1405
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,040
so funny cuz I was he was not that much

1406
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,960
on my radar when I got the show but you

1407
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,599
know as the show went along I used to

1408
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,280
look over at his desk and he would just

1409
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,280
draw the most magnificent things and you

1410
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,640
know hindsight I would have I would

1411
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:24,839
stolen them you know when he passed

1412
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:27,520
right no but you know um when he passed

1413
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:30,359
our costume or maid

1414
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,160
we it was kind of morbid it we all went

1415
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:37,880
in and sort of took a piece right and I

1416
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,920
took his tux jacket from the number that

1417
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,440
we did at the piano where I sang and he

1418
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,200
played yeah you know and I kept that tux

1419
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,920
jacket and then the costumer made us all

1420
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:52,280
pillows of the different squares of all

1421
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:55,000
of his suits that's awesome um and why

1422
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,839
am I I'm just saying that because I you

1423
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,640
know it

1424
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:00,760
at a certain point I gave that jacket

1425
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,119
away because I wanted to let him go in a

1426
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:07,520
sense do you know what I mean I just but

1427
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,559
um he will forever be you know a

1428
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,440
blueprint a part of my blueprint of my

soul you know I mean he he was in my

1430
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,599
life in a chapter that changed my life

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,920
remarkably sure um and he taught me and

1432
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,920
he led me and he made me laugh you know

1433
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,520
I'll never forget um I think it was the

1434
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,000
first table read and I was nervous and

1435
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,599
somebody made a joke joke and you know

1436
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,280
table reads are always awkward anyway

1437
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:32,799
and there's always like somebody going

1438
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,039
you know that's F horrible laugh and I

1439
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,799

1440
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,000
show but I have this like cackle laugh

1441
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:39,440
but I was nervous and so I was like and

1442
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,039
he was sitting next to me and he goes

1443
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,400
you know you know relax you've already

1444
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:46,760
got the job you know I mean it was just

1445
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,000
like oh my God you're so freaking funny

1446
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:52,000
but um I I love him and I'm glad that we

1447
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,200
can talk about him today and um and I'll

1448
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,839
tell another thing that'll sound like

1449
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,839
Ghost Hunters but I was on my way to

1450
00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:00,559
um news radio had ended and then I was

1451
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:03,280
testing for a show called three sisters

1452
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,960
that I did following it and some comedy

1453
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,839
check off thing know exactly only you

1454
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:12,280
would make that from Aspen

1455
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:13,839
but um I was driving back from the test

1456
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,000
and you know those things are absolutely

1457
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:18,240
unnatural like you're in a room this

1458
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,760
small they're staring at you like they

1459
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,160
smell bad cheese you know you know who

1460
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,920
it's up against and you've already

1461
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,880
signed the page and the money's on the

1462
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,760
line right so I stand to make amount of

1463
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,359
dollars that have one two three four

1464
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,920
five six seven numbers in them a week if

1465
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,359
I'm good in that one minute right but

1466
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,599
and I got out of there and I was

1467
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:40,200
sweating profusely and I thought I did

1468
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,280
well and I had I sunroof and I it was

1469
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,839
night time it it was like s or 8 and I I

1470
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,680
put the sunroof down I was driving back

1471
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:49,119
to

1472
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,280
Malibu and I just I just would talk to

1473
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,400
Phil sometimes and I I looked up as I

1474
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,680
was driving I didn't crash and um I said

1475
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,160
you know Phil I I miss you you and I

1476
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,319
don't want to move on to another show

1477
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,119
but I think I did well and I miss you

1478
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:05,720
and I was just talking and a shooting

1479
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:08,680
star went and I just I H I've always had

1480
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,880
these moments with him in my life where

1481
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:13,200
you know like I say it's like a

1482
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,720
blueprint on my soul still yeah so yeah

1483
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,960
I just wonder what it is about a person

1484
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,599
like that obviously not knowing him

1485
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,520
personally why the hell it would affect

1486
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,280
me at all you know what I mean because

1487
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,440
you can sense goodness in people and you

1488
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,079
can sense uprightness and you can sense

1489
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,480
that he wanted to do the next right

1490
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:30,839
thing yeah you know I mean he was

1491
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,160
lovable ABS oh yeah absolutely he wasn't

1492
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:35,079
just I think it's that's I mean it was a

1493
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,520
visceral reaction to him it was kind of

1494
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:38,920
impossible to hate him sure sure I mean

1495
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,640
you never saw anything mean behind

1496
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,039
anything he did even when he was acting

1497
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,480
like I mean he would go on interviews

1498
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,880
and was clearly having fun Have You Ever

1499
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,240
Seen the interview on Conan for jingle

1500
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,960
all the way no I he just comes on Conan

1501
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,640
says so you're here for a movie called

1502
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,400
Jingle All The Way and he's like jingle

1503
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,400
all the way to the

1504
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,720
bank and then the rest of the interview

1505
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,119
was

1506
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:02,280
I it didn't matter matter he just killed

1507
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,839
it in the first second that's him and he

1508
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,559
like but you know he wasn't being a jerk

1509
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:07,880
he he didn't care but he wasn't being an

1510
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,400
[ __ ] about it like it was just you

1511
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,640
had to keep watching the whole time yeah

1512
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,319
and again it's just one of those things

1513
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,680
I could literally watch him do nothing

1514
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:22,359
and news radio was so good about letting

1515
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:24,760
you guys like do stuff and then cut away

1516
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:27,280
and then cut back to it and see you know

1517
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,440
the the repercussion of it like let him

1518
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,000
smoke in the booth you know and you cut

1519
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,160
away when you cut back you're like where

1520
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,079
did that big white square come from oh

1521
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,119
the Booth's full of smoke you know and

1522
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,319
all you see come out from it

1523
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,520
is all I mean it was all office

1524
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,240
inappropriate oh yeah right I mean even

1525
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,920
the way I mean what we came out with my

1526
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,400
outfits was what's the most

1527
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,440
inappropriate thing this idiotic

1528
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,799
secretary can wear and it's and it's so

1529
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,480
and it and like and there's one thing in

1530
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,520
it that's really gratifying about being

1531
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,799
a fan of of the show and you know

1532
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,079
watching stuff now and seeing like

1533
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:03,839
something so that something so obvious

1534
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:06,520
that you did perfectly that they lifted

1535
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,480
verbatim and stuck in 30 Rock you know

1536
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,680
what I mean I mean honestly they took it

1537
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,440
and went oh that worked there let's do

1538
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,000
it here and it works again they I don't

1539
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,520
want to go too far down this road but

1540
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,319
you know they did it with suddenly Susan

1541
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,240
yeah of course they took it exactly and

1542
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:23,720
named that character Vicki no really I

1543
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,599
didn't I mean and I you know I remember

1544
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,839
Paul Sims going to the network you know

1545
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,280
to war

1546
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:32,760
really you know to mix this up maybe you

1547
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,960
know but but you know do a good

1548
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,920
impression of

1549
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,920
you I know thank

1550
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:44,799
you um that was her going through a wind

1551
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,960
tunnel ladies and gentlemen I um was I

1552
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,680
GNA say I thought it was good too you

1553
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,359
know I think it was Phil maybe who said

1554
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,319
to me you know imitation is the

1555
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:56,160
sincerest form of

1556
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,359
Television you know so I you know I felt

1557
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,880
like that was flattering to us you know

1558
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:01,599
and and they did just shoot me and all

1559
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,960
that kind of stuff and then but you

1560
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,400
can't you know there's you can't create

1561
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,960
it's impossible it never works

1562
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,280
especially with you guys had you know

1563
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,039
again every moment you know you it's

1564
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,559
just you didn't know who could come in

1565
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:14,880
and it didn't matter because and I don't

1566
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,160
think it'll ever happen again which

1567
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,119
makes me sad you know but I feel blessed

1568
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,280
that I got that because it happens so

1569
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,880
rarely in television yeah you mean

1570
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,760
happened in general or happened to you

1571
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,319
just happened to an actor you know who

1572
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,039
get get on a show that can run that is

1573
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:33,160
also not creatively embarrassing that

1574
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,440
you know can make you some good money

1575
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,359
and you can find a job for six years

1576
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,559
five and a half years whatever it is you

1577
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:41,440
know where you respect everybody and you

1578
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:43,799
you feel like the bar is raised every

1579
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,480
day yeah you know every kind of

1580
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:48,079
opportunity since then is I I have only

1581
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,960
that to compare it to because it was my

1582
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:53,079
first experience and it's always

1583
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:55,119
somewhat daunting to me to try to find

1584
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:58,079
my way in another setting and you know

1585
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:00,280
thankfully I love to sing and I'm a sort

1586
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,000
of a theater monkey so you know that's

1587
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,079
what I spend my time that's kind of my

1588
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,559
joy and I'm grateful that I have that

1589
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,559
because I don't think television could

1590
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:10,240
compare for me yeah film some film does

1591
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,799
you know I did a film with Dave we were

1592
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,079
trapped in Omaha for four months you

1593
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:17,359
don't want to know the story that's

1594
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:20,039
another podcast wow really okay we had

1595
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,119
stay and stay's grandparents are from

1596
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:23,880
Omaha as well all I remember about Josh

1597
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:26,799
Le was that his pen was always exploded

1598
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,079
in his pan pocket you remember that

1599
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,359
on one of the writers on news radio and

1600
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:33,680
ran the show the last season hilarious

1601
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:35,319
great writer who always has something in

1602
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,319
the works too I think he just moved back

1603
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:39,280
to LA in the last six months as well

1604
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:41,400
yeah yeah yeah do you have a favorite

1605
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,760
scene that you did with Phil

1606
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:48,599
Harman we had the make out scene in the

1607
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:52,960
um Daydream episode oh yeah that was fun

1608
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:54,640
um and uh cuz he's a good gu there and

1609
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,960
but I you know I had the most fun with

1610
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,640
Phil on a Christmas episode where he and

1611
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,279
I were doing voiceovers together and

1612
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:04,279
also when he and I sang and at the piano

1613
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:07,960
so those are my two sort of no make it

1614
01:02:04,279 --> 01:02:09,680
pretty when she so so good she if you

1615
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,920
haven't seen the episode she's singing

1616
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,400
beautifully and he just keeps trying to

1617
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,520
correct her and tells her no make it

1618
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,720
pretty like this and he just does the

1619
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,839
worst eel merman just type of thing

1620
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:25,039
she's like but what am I doing wrong yes

1621
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:27,559
it was very funny yeah that that those

1622
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:30,000
moments I mean every day was kind of I

1623
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:32,279
you know that show I mean the cast of

1624
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,520
characters it just it's impossible to

1625
01:02:32,279 --> 01:02:36,599
not have that viscerally sort of alive

1626
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,400
at all times in my world sure usually

1627
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:40,079
for fans it seems but for the actors

1628
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,240
it's probably personal times that you

1629
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:47,200
spent it you know it's V it's dressing

1630
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:48,760
rooms it's you know dramas that occurred

1631
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,160
oh my gosh yeah I think Phil actually

1632
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,760
kissed most of everybody on that show he

1633
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,839
kissed he kissed Andy Dick he yes that's

1634
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,240
right uh all the all the ladies in the

1635
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,440
the Fantasy episode I don't know if he

1636
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,319
ever kissed Dave he may have I think he

1637
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,319
did I've seen him kiss Dave well

1638
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:07,960
that's that's good enough for me you

1639
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:10,920
know Dave would get in Drag and I love

1640
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,039
Dave is hot in drag love Dave fully to

1641
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,440

1647
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:26,559
so attracted to him in a weird way and

1648
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,880
Dave and I never made out all made out

performer well you know I came to Phil

1685
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,119
kind of late I didn't really become a

1686
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,799
fan of his till 2000 um Vicki I never

1687
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,520
watched news radio in it land because I

1688
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:56,440
couldn't keep up with the time changes

1689
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,960
it seemed um so you know I came to him

1690
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,520
kind of late and as I look back on it

1691
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,319
now and especially with what I'm doing

1692
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,119
now with Paul and and the rest of the

1693
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:08,839

Hollywood Walk of Fame right well we do

1732
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,079
have to wrap up in about 10 or 15

1733
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,359
minutes 20 minutes uh you know we can

1734
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,079
keep stretching out cuz I could just

1735
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:51,160
listen to you talk all day so that's

1736
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:53,359
like Jeremy you're fine but um I get it

1737
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,760
Aspen Jeremy by the way is wearing a

1738
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,720
picture of himself Jeremy is wearing a

1739
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,200
picture of himself

1740
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,480
that's the problem maybe you could post

1741
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,720
a picture because I didn't know if that

1742
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:06,000
was maybe if you and Jean Wilder had a

1743
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:09,240
child no that's me it's a picture of me

1744
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,319
on my chest so I remember how humble of

1745
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,839
you I knew I was coming down to Melrose

1746
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:16,000
and I figured if somebody cut my head

1747
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:18,039
off they can still identify my body so

1748
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,680
that's what I did my God you know Mike

1749
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:21,079
from the writers room in news radio did

1750
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,079
you ever hear any stories about Phil or

1751
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,000
were at that point where they just

1752
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,920
didn't want to talk about it really was

1753
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,520
the last season and I just think it was

1754
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,279
too hard you know I mean I think it

1755
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:34,319
almost you know everybody had to move on

1756
01:07:32,279 --> 01:07:35,920
in the sense of the show itself you know

1757
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,920
I had been around before you know when

1758
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,480
Phil was there just as you know a friend

1759
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,839
of the show and by the time I was there

1760
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,279
you know it it's interesting to me how

1761
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:46,000
you know Vicki talked about the cast

1762
01:07:44,279 --> 01:07:48,640
because the writers were pretty tight

1763
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,200
too and and you know in the the couple

1764
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,680
of episodes that I was around were

1765
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,240
really gang written you know somebody's

1766
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,559
name my name was on one but you know it

1767
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,960
was written by the entire staff you know

1768
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:58,559
and you know I had scenes that I wrote

1769
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,799
and all but you know it's it's

1770
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,760
interesting how that show the cast was

1771
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:04,480
Ensemble and a lot of the writers were

1772
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,680
Ensemble a few moved on to other project

1773
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,279
at the time but there was kind of a core

1774
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,839
group that kind of stuck around for the

1775
01:08:07,279 --> 01:08:11,760
years and all too and you had to be well

1776
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:13,319
you couldn't be careful but you know it

1777
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,359
what happened was we were all such a

1778
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:18,440
nucleus that if things were going on in

1779
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:20,040
your life they would take them yes oh

1780
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,640
okay you mentioned something right it

1781
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,239
became part of the show that fact now

1782
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,040
just go on to news radio tangent had you

1783
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:29,000
met Melissa Samuels because I'd always

1784
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,600
heard that your character was somewhat

1785
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,880
based on Melissa Samuels do you know who

1786
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,359
she is was she Paul's assistant at a

1787
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,960
time or something he looked I guess

1788
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:38,920
somewhat I don't know maybe maybe yeah

1789
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,199
you know it's funny because I got this

1790
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:44,239
the scene the audition scene and it said

1791
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:46,000
something like the description was which

1792
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,000
I've come to ignore every one of them

1793
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,839
now but you know I was young to it and

1794
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,080
and it said uh something like you know

1795
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:56,000
Spacey you know which isn't me like

1796
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,640
everything that's not me bubbly faced

1797
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,239
out you know and I thought I'm not going

1798
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,839
to get this so let me go the other way

1799
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:06,480
and I made it really serious and I think

1800
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:07,880
something flipped and you know and um

1801
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,520
and the writers were smart enough to see

1802
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,520
it because I certainly only knew it to

1803
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,159
do it that way but it's when I

1804
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,080
auditioned I remember I was sitting next

1805
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:16,719
to Dave who I didn't know because I I

1806
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,920
was like locked away in the world of

1807
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,040
theater and I was like a kid from Ohio

1808
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,400
where we would fight over who was going

1809
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,120
to get the mail me and my sister I mean

1810
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,920
there was no access to like St I'm not

1811
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,679
even lying and so

1812
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,000
um you know we got to go to the mall and

1813
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,799
Heen forbid your parents knew you were

1814
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,799
watching Kids in the Hall men dressed as

1815
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:35,839
women that's right it was so was just so

1816
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:39,640
edgy but so Dave was there and like

1817
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:41,040
Bernie brillstein and Paul and you know

1818
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,319
all these people were there and I had no

1819
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,920
idea who any of them were Jimmy Burrows

1820
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,560
and I remember I when I got the job you

1821
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,359
know and I got to the table read and I

1822
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:52,880
started realizing like oh that's pH hard

1823
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:54,360
man Jesus that's day fully I would have

1824
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,440
been nervous and probably wouldn't have

1825
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,360
gotten it but I don't remember how I got

1826
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,199
on that tangent of just the writers

1827
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,120
would take you know what was going on

1828
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:04,320
with us they would it was a little scary

1829
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,480
sometimes and you know oh and Joe Rogan

1830
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,800
used to do this thing I just have to

1831
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,640
tell because it was used to terrorize us

1832
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,719
I don't know if you remember this he

1833
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,880
used to do this thing where he would

1834
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:16,520
draw ahead and then he would do like

1835
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,000
what day like today I'll do you Vicki

1836
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,080
and he would like do in front of

1837
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
everybody and it was supposed to be

1838
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,920
funny but it was too honest so it would

1839
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,440
be like this much of your brain is taken

1840
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:27,120
up with I hate my life with Nick this

1841
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:29,040
part of your brain is taken up with just

1842
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,440
let me get through the day this part of

1843
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,400
the but remember he used to draw those

1844
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:35,040
brains he used to terrorize us like we

1845
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,960
all would have a brain it would be like

1846
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,840
what is he who's he going to draw today

1847
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,120
he was always honest that's kind of

1848
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,960
ironic that the guy who's most into

1849
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,800
other men punching him in the head would

1850
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,840
be writing about somebody else remember

1851
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:50,560
story of Joe Rogan one day on the set

1852
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,159
like kind of being amused that the gas

1853
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,679
guy got trapped in his backyard with the

1854
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:58,199
two pitbulls

1855
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,239
that's kind of how I would sum him up he

1856
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:02,239
funny again you have a different

1857
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,679
experience than I do because I love Joe

1858
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,120
Rog and I'm not saying

1859
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,840
you by way the image that people that

1860
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,560
the average person has of him is man

1861
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,320
show and punching guy I know he's

1862
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,199
[ __ ] amazing you know like he was

1863
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,360
always like so friendly to me like the

1864
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:18,040
episode I

1865
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,520
did so hard he's one of the main reasons

1866
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:23,159
I actually watch UFC or MMA at all

1867
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,800
because I hate announcers for anything I

1868
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:26,080
mean literally and one of my favorite

1869
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,960
ones and I know why I'm going on Joe

1870
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,560
Rogan tagant but um it was one of those

1871
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,000
moments and it's like it's where it's

1872
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,239
where the reality of something butts up

1873
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,719
against what the perception should be

1874
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,560
and everybody turns into a [ __ ] idiot

1875
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:37,159
you know what I mean and so it's this

1876
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,159
it's this UFC fight and it's these two

1877
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,760
guys fighting and basically all of them

1878
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:42,760
look the same now you know they all have

1879
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,840
shaved heads and Tattoos over 40% of

1880
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,320
their body and they got these shorty

1881
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,760
shorts and everything else all right so

1882
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,000
there's two guys fighting and there's

1883
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,520
the color guy and Joe calling it and the

1884
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,960
one guy the color gu is trying to

1885
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,040
describe the two people and they both

1886
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:56,159
have whatever their names are they look

1887
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:59,120
exactly the same shaved head tattoos

1888
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:02,679
weing black trunks one's black one's

1889
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:05,320
white all right the guy doing color goes

1890
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:07,800
and maae is the one in the in the black

1891
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:09,840
trunks that have the writing that says

1892
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,800
and the and he's trying to describe them

1893
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,159
even though they look exactly the same

1894
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,760
and Joe goes politically correct you

1895
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:17,080
mean the black guy you know not the

1896
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,960
white guy through just could not tell a

1897
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,040
lie you know it was like how do I look

1898
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,120
in this dress like the Bartlet

1899
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:26,239
pear like what if you couldn't lie right

1900
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,560
but um yeah he's that guy but he's know

1901
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:31,360
he's very uh generous and fun he's a

1902
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:34,159
different person like the projected than

1903
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,080
the uh uh uh what was the eating bug

1904
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:38,320

1906
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,239
crazy stuff he's good on it but as a

1907
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,560
personal level just so you know that guy

1908
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,000
uh I have nothing but great things to

1909
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,800
say about it's funny yeah and he was you

1910
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,320
know as we all were heartbroken but I

1911
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,239
was most surprised to see his reaction

1912
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,719
to Phil hard right hard yeah very hard

1913
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:56,840
yeah very sensitive guy you know again

1914
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,800
he wouldn't think you know and but you

1915
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,600
know everybody there took it so hard it

1916
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,960
was just there was no way to take

1917
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,440
something like that easy no matter how

1918
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,199
hard you you know what you knew about

1919
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,840
his Phil and brinn's relationship you

1920
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:10,600
know nobody projects that you know what

1921
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,800
ended up happened you know and it was

1922
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,880
great talking to brother there's a part

1923
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,520
of me just wanted to kind of yell are

1924
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,440
the kids okay you know just figure

1925
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,199
they're okay I've heard that they're

1926
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,199
thriving and that they are okay they're

1927
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:22,199
with her

1928
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,920
sister you know I I think probably Brinn

1929
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:25,639
like anybody that is in the middle of a

1930
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,280
disease was a lovely person that got

1931
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:30,639
lost you know absolutely um and so that

1932
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:32,679
her sister has them is probably perfect

1933
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:35,639
I think one thing to make sure we

1934
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:39,159
concentrate on before we end is

1935
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:41,080
obviously uh you know he left a huge

1936
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:42,639
Legacy for people and I don't the point

1937
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,360
of this podcast is for people not to

1938
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:46,880
forget those legacies not that I think

1939
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:48,520
it's in he's in any danger with that but

1940
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,800
I think there are people who just didn't

1941
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,199
they're already they wouldn't have grown

1942
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,360
up with him and they might have seen him

1943
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,280
they're just gonna see him on reruns or

1944
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:56,480
they're gonna hear his voice and not

1945
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,400
know who that guy is um I I don't know I

1946
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,360
I just like to leave it leave people

1947
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,800
with uh listen to everything you can see

1948
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,880
everything that you can and realize that

1949
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,159
it's just go to IMDb and then be blown

1950
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,760
away and see all the different things

1951
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:08,880
he's done and understand how important

1952
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,080

funny men yeah Vicki is there anything

1973
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,679
else you would like to leave us with as

1974
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:55,480
far as you know I just feel absolutely

1975
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:58,360
blessed that I was lucky enough to get

1976
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,960
to spend five and a half you know five

1977
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,760
and a half years with him yeah you know

1978
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,960
I'm I'm a better person for it I learned

1979
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:07,360
a lot I'm a better actor you know and I

1980
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,120
miss him terribly to this day you could

1981
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,520
see his SK skill and everybody else's

1982
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,880
skill rubbing off on one another but you

1983
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,239
could see there was something in him

1984
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,920
that clearly rubbed off on everybody you

1985
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:18,080
know what I mean and I mean whether it

1986
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,800
was the way that the man could go quote

1987
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,480
unquote over the top but still you

1988
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,560
didn't care you believed it the whole

1989
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,159
time I mean you know you're you're stage

1990
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,960
trained and you knew how to go over if

1991
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:28,159
you had to go over but I mean still like

1992
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,880
slowly but surely you could see

1993
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:31,800
everybody kind of catching up he taught

1994
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,400
me to make the stakes high but to use

1995
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,520
the forehead as a prum you know because

1996
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,400
when I first came to TV I was doing this

1997
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,639
still because I was on stage all the

1998
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,920
time I hadn't figured out you know not

1999
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:43,960
because I see a lot of people in

2000
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,639
television the Trap is I don't want to

2001
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,120
really see like I'm not going to do

2002
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:49,920
anything I did an episode never mind I

2003
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,239
did an episode of something an hour long

2004
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,960
it's like my grandmother always said if

2005
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:55,280
you don't have anything nice to say come

2006
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,360
sit next to me

2007
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,280
but literally I I couldn't hear some of

2008
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,239
the I was in right here and I was like

2009
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,800
what the [ __ ] are you I can hear you you

2010
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:04,600
know yep that's one of my I did I did it

2011
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,080
one of those dramas and like literally I

2012
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,840
had to wait for the person's lips to

2013
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,920
stop moving because otherwise I wouldn't

2014
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,159
have known where to speak like oh God

2015
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,239
you know and you don't want to be a dick

2016
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:17,840
to the lead and go what why do you

2017
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:20,000
say I'm right here I can't even hear you

2018
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,760
I know speak up and I remember like I

2019
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,880
was doing pushing ton and Billy Bob

2020
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,520
Thorton was in the movie and John qak

2021
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,719
and they used to you know we would play

2022
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,679
around play around and then they'd say

2023
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:31,000
film you know and all that sound speed

2024
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:33,040
and Billy Bob would say now no acting

2025
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,520
but Billy Bob makes choices with his

2026
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:38,000
non-acting you know but but Phil did

2027
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,280
teach me how to make the stakes High I

2028
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,040
watched him and learned from him you

2029
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,639
know how to keep it high but keep the

2030
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,120
prenium in the forehead area and and he

2031
01:16:43,639 --> 01:16:47,719
could do it better than anyone and he

2032
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,199
was the glue of that show he without him

2033
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:52,280
