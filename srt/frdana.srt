suit no no they don't say that about you

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,920
Dana cuz you're making the big bucks out

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,640
in Hollywood now that's right but I

94
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,120
ain't I ain't spend it in un clo as you

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,159
can tell who spent more time in the

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,959
wardrobe no no no but you know something

97
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:50,599
Dana is that your comedy act you touch

98
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,879
issues and go places that most comedians

99
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,040
wouldn't go yeah I just do what I think

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,519
is funny you know as as you do you know

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,319
uh I just try to think of what kind of

102
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,920
show would I like to see what would make

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
me laugh and and those are the places I

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,280
like to go I've always been sort of

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
laughing at the things that not

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,840
everybody else laughs at you know but I

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,480
mean you're talking about like

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,040
alienation humiliation uh misery despair

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,120
that's not a place where most comedians

110
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,840
go well when I experience other emotions

111
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,519
I'll talk about them the question I have

112
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,720
to ask ask of you is how much of that is

113
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
from your personal experience and how

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,520
much of it is just an act right well

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,680
it's it's all from my personal

116
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,280
experience but it's not exclusively you

117
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,199
know I mean I I'm in a great happy mood

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,880
as much as everybody else but everybody

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,600
goes through that really awkward stage

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,479
when you're in your mid 20s or or

121
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,000
whenever as a kid and that's really from

122
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,520
where I draw most of my humor that's the

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,120
stuff that I think is really funny is

124
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,039
the stuff that also hurts a little bit

125
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,400
too you know that's that's where I find

126
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,680
I'm best suited I can write jokes about

127
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,880
politics or whatever but the stuff that

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,560
I really do best is go to that sort of

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,840
feeling of uncomfortable you know when

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720
you're uncomfortable or you've blown it

131
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,759
with a woman or you know it's just when

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
it's really wrong that's what I find the

133
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,479
humor in but there's so much pain I mean

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
most people don't go there for humor

135
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,759
yeah they don't that's why I'm sort of

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,720
unique it works I mean that's but that's

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,120
you I mean that whates make Dana G so

138
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,080
special yeah right exactly I mean it's

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,280
it's a limited it's a a limited thing

140
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,880
but it it works for me you know uhhuh I

141
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,919
can't imagine you ever feeling any of

142
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,280
those feelings oh no no no no the last

143
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,639
time I felt misery was one day I was got

144
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,600
up in the morning I looked in the mirror

145
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,160
and it was dirty oh no no

146
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,680
see now you tell me that story I'll put

147
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,360
it into my hat okay true true it's so

148
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,800
true in your act you make fun of

149
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,880
comedians who do the like you know

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,840
punchlines set up punch line set up

151
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,759
punch line set up punch line I I love a

152
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,280
good comedian and it doesn't have to be

153
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,280
standard what I sort of like to poke fun

154
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,720
at is people that do it in an uncreative

155
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,080
way and there's just that cookie cutter

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,360
you know sort of thing I mean cuz you

157
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,039
know you created a vehicle for yourself

158
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,440
that's it's Unique and you're your own

159
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,919
person you know how to do it you know

160
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,039
what you're doing and we know other

161
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,360
people that have done the same thing and

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,039
then there were people that they there's

163
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,600
no creativity to it they just sort of

164
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,199
come out blurt out the jokes get their

165
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,720
check and leave and those are the people

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,680
I have little patience with who inspired

167
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,080
the type of Comedy that you do it um boy

168
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,840
it's really hard to say I remember when

169
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,319
I was young like who was your favorite

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
comic when you're starting out man

171
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,080
unquestionably Richard Pryor yeah

172
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,120
Richard prior the first Richard PRI

173
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,280
movie live in concert where he had the

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
heart attack that one bit where he had

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,919
the heart attack is really what stuck

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,919
with me as like because it was about

177
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,080
something really horribly painful but it

178
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,039
was so hilarious and he did it in such a

179
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,800
theatrical way I just thought that was

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,360
amazing I was also a huge fan of George

181
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,280
Carlin although I don't think that I

182
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,280

you like his style of Comedy no see I

215
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,240
like I like all that sort of stuff I

216
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,159
mean I mean I I love Don Rickles okay I

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,599
think Don you know anybody that's that's

218
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:55,120
telling the truth about who they are M

219
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,840
makes me laugh I didn't I never saw raw

220
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,199
okay and I I'm not a big fan of Martin

221
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,000
Lawrence because I don't think Martin

222
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,720
Lawrence put as much creativity into it

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,400
as Eddie Murphy did I mean Eddie has an

224
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,960
incredible mind and Martin I think is an

225
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,000
amazing performer but he doesn't the

226
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,039
material it just doesn't have the the

227
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,360
spark to me that Eddie Murphy had stepen

228
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,360
Wright another just being who he is

229
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,080

his day was nobody could touch him was

267
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,480
so great and you can see him hold back

268
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,680
and you can see him try to please

269
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,560
everybody instead of making people laugh

270
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,560
he's not being himself have no time for

271
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,519
it like what do you mean he's not being

272
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,200
himself what he's it's like if I went on

273
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,079
and pretended to be really and pretended

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,279
to do just Bland material when I when

275
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,959
you know there's somebody there's

276
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,399
something behind it mhm you know if if

277
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,839
uh if Prince how how would I look at you

278
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,440
and think of Prince If Prince If Prince

279
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
went on and sang you know Michael Bolt

280
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
and stuff to try to sell more records

281
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,480
he's not being himself Jerry Seinfeld

282
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,600
same thing clever bright boring nothing

283
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,640
there excites me there's nothing

284
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,000
dangerous about either one of those

285
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,360
performers you know what I mean that's

286
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,240
but is it still funny though they're

287
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,720
still funny but to me I don't I'm not

288
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,200
interested because there's no danger

289
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,320
there you know what I'm saying you know

290
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,120
there's going to be a sense of danger

291
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
Eddie Murphy brilliant Richard Pryor you

292
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,880
don't know what's going to happen next

293
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,360
what's going to happen it might be scary

294
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,120
it might be wild it might be something

295
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,240
I've never heard before you know that's

296
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,600
what keeps you on your seat that's

297
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,839
what's vital that's what's theater

298
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,760
that's why you watch Jay Leno Jerry

299
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,240
Seinfeld boring Sandra burnhard has

300
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,160
never made me laugh I don't get it uhuh

301
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,519
how about Sam Kennison Sam Kennon was

302
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,079
great and when Sam Kennison started um

303
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,920
towards the end of his life uh he sort

304
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,279
of became this parody of a heavy metal

305
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,320
guy but before Sam Kennison was even on

306
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,800
TV when he was just working the door at

307
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,240
The Comedy Store no one could touch it

308
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,600
Sam Sam kenneson was the most you laugh

309
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,079
so hard you like beg him to stop really

310
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
yeah another guy who was just real being

311
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,360
himself Bill Hicks greatest being

312
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,680
himself talking about What mattered to

313
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,519
Bill Hicks the best the best yeah Paula

314
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,839
Poundstone very funny talks about what's

315
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,639
important to her gets it out M you

316
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,880
mentioned Leno now you've done Areno

317
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,320
have you done have you done Leno yet

318
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,639
haven't yeah know and I know the guy

319
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I've been to his house you know but he

320
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,079
just I think he looks at people like me

321
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,839
it's probably why I don't like him is he

322
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,920
looks at me and sees somebody that's

323
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,040
that's a little on the edge and

324
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,519
dangerous instead of framing that and

325
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
putting it on television and presenting

326
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,240
it it here something different and

327
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,839
unique they go no no we can only have

328
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,480
Bland people on but is because the style

329
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,959
that you do the comedy that you do is

330
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,320
such it's so dangerous does that hurt

331
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,040
your TV appearance to say like Letterman

332
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,760
yes it does but I can't compromise who I

333
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,600
am you just got to do what you do and

334
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,480
eventually they'll catch up that's what

335
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,120
you wait for I mean same with you you

336
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,040
you wouldn't change ticket on TV you

337
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,040
just do what you do let everybody else

338
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,519
catch up could you see me in blue jeans

339
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,120
no could you see me in anything

340
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,160
but my my my my my my there's room for

341
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,279
all different types that's you is a wide

342

500
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,280
why of I'm doing at the comedy Gallery

talking more about just the way I see

502
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,600

many things that don't work that should

510
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,960
and it's just so frustrating and it's

511
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,440
and it goes all the way back to it goes

512
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,760

513
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,280

I'm right behind you talking about the

516
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,400
Generation X of course we just lost Kurt

517
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,919
coang with the terrible suicide thoughts

518
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
about that uh oh that was that was sad I

519
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,000
mean I mean people joke about suicide a

520
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,799
lot but I think the thing that people

521
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,280
don't really understand is that when you

522
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,080
for a lot of people that commit suicide

523
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,240
they don't have a choice it's a chemical

524
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,840
imbalance in their brain like my dad

525
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,000
would Kur Coan some drug addict junkie

526
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,159

528
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,280
situation go well if I was a big rock

star and had all the money in the world

530
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,080
I wouldn't kill myself of course not

531
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,960
because your chemicals are all in the

532
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,520
right balance right you know that was

533
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,520
sad I mean again why can't Michael
