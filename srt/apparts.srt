98
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,360
like you know like here's like 17 things

99
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,240
to do with your kids schooling and all

100
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,120
that jazz so just let me know I'm gonna

101
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,479
pitch something to you and then you let

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,560
me know if you think it's reasonable or

103
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,600
not okay uh so here's here's a tip uh if

104
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,199
you especially if you need to get some

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,840
work done try asking your toddler for

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
help with work and do simple computer

107
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,199
tasks like emails and make a plan for

108
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,880
what you need to do do you think that

109
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:51,320
would po that for a um that

110
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,919
is technically a yay okay and I say

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,000
technically because you don't want to

112
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,240
give them any anything real that they

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
can get their sticky little peanut

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,520
butter hands on little ones are like yes

115
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,520
yes I got to get those likes I have a

116
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,360
tweet they copy you but he likes to play

117
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,840
the game of I'm an adult I've got jobs

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
you know I like to play that game too

119
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm playing I'm making a TV show right

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,360
now okay here's another activity collect

121
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,319
rocks I thought someone someone was

122
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,600
trying to hit a word count on that blog

123
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,000
and they were like I need one more

124
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,039
activity that sounds like an insult that

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,240
sounds like what a old school like kid

126
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,520
from the 20s like a b boy would say

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,160
they're like why don't you go collect

128
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,800
rocks you know like that's

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,840
this doesn't sound like a fun activity

130
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,880
at all here's the one I really liked uh

131
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,000

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,919
like because they do need to kind of

136
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,560
figure out sometimes how to be by

137
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,880
themselves and you know not have you in

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,880

specifically likes to hear over and over

164
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,800
again you say no song practice being

165
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,199
boys I'm like let me listen to some

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
bootsy baby come on a little oh our

167
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,240
wedding song was Gucci Collins so that

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,039
was fun um i' rather yeah that's a good

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,759
wedding song it's a sweet jam and then

170
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,280
the last uh tip you told me if it's a

171
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,840
yay or a nay is just have a real

172
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,000
conversation I do actually like to have

173
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,639
a real conversation with them I I you

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,199
know I heard this thing about baby talk

175
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,280
apparently developmentally a child

176
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,879
figures out how to get you to say the

177
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,160
word that they want you to say so you

178
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,800
say like you want your bottle and they

179
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,560
go Baba and then at some point you go

180
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,919
Baba too because you've heard them say

181
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,720
that and it's how they learn but really

182
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,360
it's Master manipulation when it comes

in Los Angeles a lot you know the only

381
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,240
thing I don't like about it is that when

382
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,880
people come to comedy shows

383
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,320

385
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,559

uh you know it's not it's not fun it's

388
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,080
not fun I will say the last time you

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,600
were in La I had the pleasure of opening

390
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,120

391
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,520
before the show so you can eat it uh

392
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,200
they love you the fans they do love well

393
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,520
that was very fun that show was very fun

394
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:40,159
yes we're going to play a game uh called

395
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:42,600
uh La Orno uh Los Angeles or no and um I

396
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,360
just found a couple a few um but it's

397
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,240
also Chicago because uh because why not

398
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,039
um I found some phrases that were

399
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:56,440
overheard in either Los Angeles or

400
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,520
Minneapolis okay or Chicago okay so

401
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,360
you're I'm going to read one and then

402
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,720
you tell me if it's la or no Minnesota

403
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,799
or Chicago okay okay all right uh so the

404
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,520
first one is uh first phrase is uh I

405
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,919
wasn't actually saying words I was just

406
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
saying

407
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,600
things it seems very that seems very Los

408
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
Angeles to me it seems like the

409
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,080
beginning of a podcast that has to do

410
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,080
with True

411
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,039
Crime right to making my husband laugh

412
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,679
hasn't laughed once this whole time

413
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,799
probably because I yelled at him when we

414
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,280
were live and I have 17 text messages

415
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,480
about people saying we can hear you

416
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,159
great wasn't looking at my

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,440
like where where you heard it oh I

421
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,600

422
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,280
like very reliable Twitter and Instagram

423
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,320
