if you're just walking around drunk all

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,439
the time calling everyone [ __ ]

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,079
y'all and what were some of uh your

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,240
favorite comedians growing up oh man

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,360
um you know when I was really young I

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,759
would watch you know just comedy Central

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,079
and and not really know who I was

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,399
watching and I'd meet these people later

36
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,960
on you know when I was when I was doing

37
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,600
standup or whatever I remember watching

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,119
Marin when I was real young really

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,560
liking it it's I think about that a lot

40
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,320
and it's pretty weird you know I was

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,479
like a 10-year-old who was like I get

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,680
this cynical egotistic like Bohemian guy

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,640
but I did yeah you you've met some of

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,240
these people how disillusioning did that

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,719
end up

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,479
being oh it's it's varies from person to

47
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,000
person you know like they say don't meet

48
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,280
your Heroes and a lot not a lot but some

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
times people tend to you know let you

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,039
down be a little bit of a mess and then

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
sometimes it's like oh they're

52
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,200
everything you thought they were going

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,599
to be a lot a lot of comics I could say

54
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,879
I worked with who I was big fans of

55
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,200
proved me right you know they were great

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,440
um some I won't name complete [ __ ]

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,640
psychos but it goes with the territory

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,400
yeah you came from Austin now you're in

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,280
New York um I know there's a lot of

60
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
differences between LA and New York

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
stuff what are the differen is kind of

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,360
between doing comedy in Austin and doing

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,640
comedy in New York City somebody want

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,560
describe new York to me is a city with

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,560
like an exclamation point on it like no

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,000
matter what it is it has a exclamation

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,319
point you know it's like when something

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,319
terrible happens like worse than it

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,560
would be anywhere else but then when you

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,480
have like a great set you know you were

71
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,200
you were there next to some [ __ ]

72
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,640
famous person you used to watch on TV

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,040
you know and you you reach these high

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,120
highs or whatever uh so it's just kind

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,000
of like living in an exaggerated fast

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,080
motion I lived in Austin forever there's

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,480
always old musicians that'll just you

78
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,959
know work a job make a record in their

79
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,519
spare time you ask them how's the record

80
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,080
coming they go great you know they don't

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,360
go I'm going to be on America's Got

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,239
Talent tomorrow and it's going to make

83
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,239
my career you know it's just you love

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,239
what you do and you make a

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,280
thing uh humors the uh stand up Records

86
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,599
album we made a few years ago

87
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,640
um I uh well there's a lot going on

88
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,200
there it's actually kind of fitting that

89
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,080
we're in Minnesota right now cuz one of

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,400
the reasons I I decided to call it humor

91
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,959
is I was think I was a lot about The

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
Replacements and uh I really liked their

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
sort of sense of humor and their

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,280
antagonist antagonism with like the

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,840
music industry and just the concept of

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,239
selling your art and that sort of [ __ ]

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,080
you know so they made an album called

98
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,959
Let It Be yeah that's a very funny thing

99
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,120
to do you know just name your album like

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,000
after somebody else's clearly famous

101
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,519
thing you know so um that kind that idea

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,599
kind of collided with h just a

103
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,680
conversation I was having with a friend

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,920
of mine we were trying to figure out the

105
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,040
funniest album cover of all time and uh

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,799
I think Fleetwood Mac Rumors is just one

107
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,599
of the weirdest [ __ ] things ever you

108
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,239
know so you can see the dots connecting

109
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,799
then oh [ __ ] rumors I'll call it humors

110
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,200
it's also kind of a double on Tandra for

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,560
the way the med medieval you know people

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,680
would uh refer to your bile and your

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,919
insides which to me comedy is sort of

114
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,040
adjacent to you know uh I've been

115
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:25,360
accused of puking out jokes a few times

116
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,800
um uh I was in college and I was I was

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,880
dating this girl she's drawing a picture

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,720
of me right we're hanging out she's

119
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,199
drawing a picture she goes hey man I I

120
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,639
don't know if you know this but you have

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
very wide set eyes you have very exotic

122
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,560
features right and I was reading a

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,759
textbook and the textbook was telling me

124
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,360
that WID set eyes are often a byproduct

125
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,360
of fetal alcohol

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,919
syndrome so here's why I shouldn't have

127
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,520
kids though cuz I turned to her and I

128
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,400
said uh hey you know be really funny is

129
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,479
if I got you drunk or I got you pregnant

130
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,160
h probably both uh and then you got

131
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,800
drunk a lot while you were pregnant and

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
then you gave birth to a child that we

133
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,960
would name shark face right

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,560
cuz eyes would be all over the side of

135
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,960
head able to see in both directions

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,280
that'd be hilarious but not in the long

137
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,440
term of that story right you don't need

138
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,880
a sharkface kid living on your couch not

139
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,560
going to Community College playing Xbox

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,360
and [ __ ] all day smoking menthols for

141
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,360
some reason I don't know why

142
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,840
I think it's interesting because if you

143
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,160
look at uh humors you see a fresh fa

144
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,840
face clean shave and well not clean shap

145
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,199
but you know I me and this this is what

146
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,919
New York's done to you yeah yeah yeah

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
you know it's funny that you bring that

148
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,560
up because I've been seriously trying to

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,960
cut my hair for like a year straight and

150
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,479
I'm just so [ __ ] busy I just kind of

151
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,240
like it hadn't come up um I kind of have

152
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,440
live a life that's just wall to- wall

153
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,319
[ __ ] work and uh I kind of just

154
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,599
forgot to pay attention to what my head

155
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
looks

156
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:09,599
like this is a part of the show where I

157
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,759
guess I would ask if you guys like drugs

158
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,759
but we can just skip over

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,280
that the G the Gathering here we're at

160
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,400
right

161
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,880
now I feel like you guys like people

162
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,039
like drugs but you guys don't even know

163
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,919
about the the good ones yeah check this

164
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,880
out I started doing uh poppers recently

165
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,400
no one [ __ ] knows about this drug

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,759
poppers this guy [ __ ] knows there's

167
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,360
like a new woke like some some of you

168
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,160
guys don't know about this

169
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,319
[ __ ] they're fun they're like a disco

170
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,319
drug from the 70s that just gets you

171
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,160
high as you sniff it gets you high as

172
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,160
[ __ ] buy them in a like gas station

173
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,520
or some [ __ ] and no one does them but

174
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,080
everyone knows one thing about them

175
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,080
what's that your but they dilate your

176
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,960
butthole and that's why no one does

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,039
them that's the only thing there's an

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,919
amazing drug in this little capsule but

179
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,000
no one does them cuz no one wants people

180
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,680
to think that they dilate

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,680
