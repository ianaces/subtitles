1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,080
it's

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,360
ridiculous I did do Zumba though and uh

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:14,320
if you've never tried it Zumba is maybe

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:17,000
the most fun and humiliating way to lose

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,199
weight all in the same

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,600
millisecond CU they don't explain

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,760
anything to

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,720

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,480

00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,320
stripper name like a fruit or a

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,600
spice but it's next

something and that's it that's all the

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,520
instructions you

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,479
get there is no more help a

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,560
common then they start the music and

27
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,680

[Laughter]

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,479
I can't prove it but I believe that the

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,159
Zumba Corporation pays senior citizens

33
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,159
to master

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,759
it and it's a brilliant marketing

35
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,079
strategy when you see an

36
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,399
