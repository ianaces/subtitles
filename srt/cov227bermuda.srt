with me so uh let's talk about your

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,559
influences so I know that I emailed you

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,399
a long time ago and you're like I didn't

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
listen to a lot of comedy albums that's

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,480
fine you're on a lot of comedy albums I

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,120
listen to so I still want to talk to you

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,280
about your influences um so you're a

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,000
master mimic in terms of and maybe

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,120
that's by uh maybe because you had to be

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,920
but or is that something that you've

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,760
always done I think I've always done

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,399
that I always heard stuff on on records

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,960
and on the radio and I always imitated

24
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,280
that so I was already tuned into hearing

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,160
something and duplicating it mhm and or

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
trying to duplicate it so you know Al

27
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,720
didn't have to get me up to speed at all

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,360
I was already there I was already on on

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,920
board with him and the way he wanted to

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,560
do things M uh some of the early stuff I

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,680
I grew up in listening to music in the

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,560
early 60s and and into the 70s of course

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,720
uh you know my parents had uh I did have

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,159
you know some comedy albums in the house

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,920
had Alan Sherman sure and uh uh you know

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,520
some kind of things like that and and

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,320
some Jewish uh comedian albums and stuff

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
and uh but my parents also had Latin

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,360
orchestras and Jee Kuper records and

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,600
stuff like that and by the time I

41
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,600
started becoming aware of a lot of uh

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,079
pop music the Beatles had just had I was

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,880
sitting in front of the TV on February

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,960
9th 19 you know 64 wow like like

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,040
millions of others were MH and uh uh so

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,040
the Beatles of course were a big

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,479
influence uh you know a little later

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,439
Frank Zappa and sort of his humorous

49
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,960
take on a lot of stuff sure um you know

50
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,240
I just I I uh as it turns out Al

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,200
listened to a lot of the same stuff that

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,680
I did I mean you he was just a a couple

53
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,920
years behind me age-wise but he was a

54
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,960
big fan of The Beatles And The Kinks and

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,360
uh the monkeys and the Rolling Stones

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,160
and and Zappa and you know we listen to

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
a lot of the same stuff and we also both

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,319
listen to the Dr Demento show I think I

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,959
started listening probably in 71 or so

60
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,120
and how early is that into the run of

61
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,959
the show very early I think within just

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,280
a year yeah okay that makes sense wow

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,200
that must have been like the first year

64
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,080
yeah yeah I know they called 1991 his

65
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,959
20th anniversary so oh okay yeah all

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,560
right 70 or 71 would have been started

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,959
here in Los Angeles gosh and so I was

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,599
right on board with that as was Al as

69
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,360
were a ton of people in high school and

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,480
Junior High yeah so it's what we listen

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
to did you have a ton of friends who

72
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,040
also listen to dementa with you or was

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,879
it your thing where you were no a bunch

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,280
of people uh uh bunch of uh friends and

75
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,319
also bandmates and school orchestra and

76
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,400
stuff like that and those were the

77
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,400
people that worked with me on Pico and

78
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,400
svh and the ballot of woodsie owl and uh

79
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,680
um Mr ghost goes to town okay yeah so

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,159
they were you know they weren't just oh

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,519
we have to do a music project it's like

82
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,400
cool we're gonna send something to Dr

83
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,680
dento that's so great and so it was

84
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,120
although all of that stuff I mean I

85
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,599
really shouldn't have taken credit for

86
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,599
it I mean I sort of organized it and I

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,959
was the contact person but I I certainly

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,879
didn't write any of the songs uh I I

89
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,920
really didn't sing or very much on any

90
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,879
of the songs you know yet it became

91
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,000
known as the John Schwarz project yeah

92
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,560
yeah yeah okay and and actually I think

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,640
at the time it was just John Schwarz and

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,439
later on in deference to all of them we

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,159
we agreed that John Schwarz project was

96
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,280
a little more inclusive okay and uh it

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,680
uh you know that was that was the

98
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,560
beginning for me you know with with

99
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,439
catering to Dr Demento a little bit at a

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,959
time when not many people were sending

101
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,920
homemade tapes yeah uh I was I was

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,360
literally the the second or third person

103
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,640
ever to get a homemade tape plate on his

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,519
show that's insane which is what

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,040
prompted the interview in 1980 where I

106
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,040
met Al yeah oh my God that's that's a

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,239
very quick history of that brings us up

108
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,280
from the Beatles to Al mhm a strange

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,400
trip what a short strange trip it's been

110
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,640
you know you mentioned in your email the

111
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Beatles and the other day I actually had

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
another drummer on the podcast is uh

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,040
name is Tony Thaxton he's a great

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,480
drummer uh and uh also just a very funny

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,000
dude and we we were drawing all kinds of

116
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,720
just comparisons between like how

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,560
comedians learn to M mimic when they're

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,280
young and same as drummers same maybe

119
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,759
maybe most musicians are just going to

120
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,360
learn of course by listening first I

121
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,080
would unless your Mozart when she seemed

122
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,919
to be able to pick it up immediately but

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
uh he mentioned the Beatles and I was

124
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
like you know we could have talked about

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,800
the Beatles as a comedy group he's like

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,880
well shoot we should have done that

127
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,440
because I I don't know did you have was

128
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,039
it just their music or did you like them

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,400
as funny guys too did you watch the

130
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,039
movies well yeah I was I was right there

131
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,680
with hard days night and and help and uh

132
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,680
eventually Magical Mystery Tour which

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,880
was I wouldn't I don't know if it was

134
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,759
intentionally funny but right right

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,479
right uh you know yeah I was I you know

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,400
all the the TV appearances and stuff

137
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,320
like that and and the teen magazines and

138
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,800
books that were coming out and all of

139
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,280
that stuff I was right there got every

140
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,840
album you know whenever a new album was

141
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,039
coming out there was always you know

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,000
that was a birthday present or a

143
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,520
Christmas present or a you know I was I

144
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,840
did good in school present or whatever

145
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,240
it was you know that was always my

146
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
reward was getting an album that's great

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,960
uh bought the singles I mean I I just I

148
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,080
was really really into that yeah you

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,800
know probably more so than than other

150
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,280
contemporary groups like The Beach Boys

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
at the time and the stones at the time

152
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,840
even I mean I came to appreciate those

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,560
groups later on sure uh when the monkeys

154
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,840
came along they were that was what the

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,479
prefab for yeah they referred to them

156
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,240
and and and there was a lot of that kind

157
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,840
of very obviously deliberately you know

158
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,479
the the comedy and and you know the

159
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,280
interaction between the guys and a lot

160
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,280
of good music a lot of great music you

161
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,759
know written by a lot of great

162
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,479
songwriters yeah uh so so that was the

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,120
attraction too you know for that so I I

164
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,280
guess really Mo most important was the

165
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,680
music for me and uh as it is with

166
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,400
anybody of course yeah what were what

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,080
bands before you got to Al what bands

168
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,520
were you in because I I read off of your

169
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,199
website just that you were seem to be in

170
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,199
a bunch of bands before

171
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,440
I I I played with a bunch of different

172
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,400
people I think my first well my first

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,080
real band was 1970 or 71 with some guys

174
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,680
from school not my school from another

175
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,319
school that's funny which at the time

176
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,360
was unheard of I mean you really didn't

177
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,639
have a way of connecting with people

178
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,560
yeah you unless you went to school with

179
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,319
them or or they lived in your

180
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,199
neighborhood and I honestly don't

181
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,759

183
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,639
and I I was in Hamilton High okay and uh

184
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,599
they'd come over to the house and it was

185
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,160
a very odd uh it was a tree well they

186
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,319

played guitar he could play drums he was

196
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,960
one of those guys that could could put

197
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,879
his hands on an instrument and make it

198
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,080
work jez and sound really good at it but

199
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,599
no bass player at the time so they'd

200
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,199
come over we had a piano in the house

201
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,840
and and I'd bring my drums downstairs

202
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,720
into the the living room where the piano

203
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,879
was and they'd ride their bikes over

204
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,039
sure and uh you know no amps no nothing

205
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,800
you know the flute player would have the

206
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,360
flute you know in a backpack and that

207
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,560
was it yeah and and we'd play Just drums

208
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,560
Bas and piano I'm sorry drums uh flute

209
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,000
and piano that's crazy now my archiving

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,840
began at that point really I'm I'm well

211
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,680
known as archist and a lot of stuff I

212
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,560
made tapes of every rehearsal that we

213
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,720
did real toore tapes and all of that's

214
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,960
been committed now to digital and and uh

215
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,520
I just I don't know why I just I you

216
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,400
know I must have been very proud of

217
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,400
myself and thought that'd be cool stuff

218
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,199
to have and as it turns out it was cool

219
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,159
stuff did you have you do you listen

220
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,039
back Have you listened back do you

221
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:59,199
listen back often two separate questions

222
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,919
um I have and uh not terribly often I

223
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,039
mean you know it's interesting you know

224
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,440
it's it was very early on in my drumming

225
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,560
uh experience i' had only been drumming

226
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,639
for

227
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,240
um about five maybe five years okay okay

228
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,039
and not really you know not doing

229
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,879
anything professionally MH and uh I I

230
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,560
you know I I because I wasn't

231
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,960
experienced I tried I did a lot of

232
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,599
things that that weren't the norm sure

233
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,560
you know that weren't maybe considered

234
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,479
to be right and therefore some of them

235
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,759
were actually pretty cool cuz I just

236
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,360
took chances and did some pretty cool

237
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,039
things I also did some really bad things

238
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,719
so I listen and and it's like you know

239
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,479
it's like oh I would never do that now

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,959
and then you know that's like God I'm so

241
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,159
glad I don't and then I listen to other

242
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,120
things it's like God I I would never do

243
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,320
that now I'm like too much and you know

244
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,440
I'm too much in a box now to do things a

245
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,839
certain way I would never go outside of

246
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,720
the box like I did back then without

247
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,519
even thinking about it without knowing

248
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,360
and it's like you you learn you learn to

249
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,720
to be sort of in a box yeah the cool

250
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,480
thing is there's a bunch of money in the

251
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,920
corner of that box of course of course

252
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,920
you a little dark corner of the box it's

253
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,440
great but you know I listen to stuff

254
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,120
it's like God I I would never play those

255
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,040
parts now and it's too bad yeah was you

256
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,720
were you self-correcting as a quote

257
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,160
unquote better drummer or just as a more

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,519
experienced drummer or was it like did

259
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
you take lessons were you working with

260
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,959
other people who are drummers or was it

261
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,200
just self-correcting well I I did take

262
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,800
lessons and a lot of it was you know I

263
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,480
would and at the time I would listen to

264
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,480
these tapes and and uh to hear back what

265
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,920
I had done okay and it's and uh so I was

266
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
able to hear things I knew back then

267
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,959
it's like that's not working and then I

268
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,760
knew back then also it's like wow that

269
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,720
was a really cool lick and listening to

270
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,720
that stuff 40 plus years later uh it's

271
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,360
like yeah that's still that's a cool

272
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,360
lick I have I have to remember that I

273
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,079
have to you know bring that back into

274
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
rotation and then other things I did

275
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,839
it's like boy I'm so glad I grew up and

276
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,120
got out of doing that kind of miserable

277
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,839
stuff yeah but interestingly the the two

278
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,360
guys and we added a base player soon

279
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,079
after that and we we

280
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,440
uh well the order is the order of it is

281
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:06,519
we first did uh Pico and Suva yeah sent

282
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:11,079
that into Dro that was April of

283
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:14,760
19873 right okay and uh we sent that in

284
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:16,600
and it got one it got it came in second

285
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,360
out of like over 100 entries of local

286
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,640
people now the show was only local at

287
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,600
the time it wasn't National and uh and

288
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,440
we uh we came in second and because it

289
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,040
was an instrumental mhm Dr Demento

290
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,360
played it as his theme song for some

291
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,839
time he could over it right course you

292
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,279
know without obscuring the lyrics that

293
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:39,000
we didn't do uh uh um shortly now one

294
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,880
other interesting note Al had also uh

295
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,680
submitted an entry to the peon Spa

296
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,839
contest really I as I learned more about

297
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,160
it first I thought you know well he did

298
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,760
he didn't now Dr dendo played the top 10

299
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,360
entries yeah that night and and uh we

300
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,519
didn't know until we heard it come on

301
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,920
the radio that we had placed at all

302
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,920
that's great uh Al was not in there and

303
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,000
I thought oh you know poor Al didn't

304
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,200
make it into the well it turns out I

305
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,040
just found out recently from Dr dento Al

306
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,320
submitted his tape too late oh no he

307
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,160
gave he gave it to Dr nendo personally

308
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,120
uhhuh at an Afterschool assembly at

309
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,279
Lynwood High uhhuh uh in in uh April or

310
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:23,760
maybe late April of 83 MH and and it was

311
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,680
too late to uh be submitted to me and

312
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,680
and Demento put it in the trunk of his

313
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,480
car it stayed in there he sold the car

314
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,760
oh no and it's

315
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,040
probably probably somebody saw that and

316
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,160
erased over it or threw it out that's

317
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,480
hard so there's there's apparently not a

318
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,279
recording of This anywhere no and in

319
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,639
those days you recorded something on a

320
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,480
cassette and you just sent it off you

321
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,079
didn't keep a copy so there's no well he

322
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,120
says there's no copy of it right right

323
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:55,720
right right anyway uh we uh so there

324
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,360

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,600
could tell I couldn't sing and we sent

361
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,639

County Battle of the Bands this was like

367
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,079
a real Battle of the Bands sponsored by

368
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,040

sponsored it and uh they had uh prelims

370
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,920
at some of the different schools around

371
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,959
and somehow I had gotten hooked up with

372
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,000
uh well I know how I I was seeing a girl

373
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,279
at at Culver High okay that I had met

374
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,720
through these other guys and back in the

375
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,959
day I used to leave my high school at

376
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,440

377
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,560

379
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,839

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,600
for periods five and six like in Theater

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,399
Arts and in their band classes I ended

382
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,279
up playing with their Stage Band for

383
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,560
something I don't know why that would

384
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,880
never happen now you could never do that

385
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,920
and uh but we we went through all the

386
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,199
prelims as a combo group The the four of

387
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,880
us Jim Bill Jeff and I and we made it to

388
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:25,680
the Hollywood Bowl finals and played the

389
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,040
Hollywood Bowl it not my 74 was not

390
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,279
still not my first time at the Hollywood

391
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,560
Bowl I did something there with with the

392
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,600
marching band a couple of times but wow

393
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,920
this was this was pretty cool you know

394
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,519
where when we were the four of us were

395
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,600
playing there were like people just

396
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,560
watching us that's insane and we tied

397
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,079
for first place wow uh on that they made

398
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,920
up an album which I'm sure only the

399
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,279
people who were in The Thing bought

400
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,959
copies I was see even then I was smart I

401
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,639
bought two albums of course one to keep

402
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,360
one to have yeah yeah yeah and and uh so

403
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,399
one is open mhm and one is still sealed

404
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:01,440
oh man and uh so that was pretty cool so

405
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,600
you know we essentially won the the 1974

406
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,600
in the combo division mhm uh I don't

407
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,279
know that anybody else from that uh

408
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,240
competition went anywhere didn't I mean

409
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,320
we certainly didn't as a band right

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,639
however Jeff Rona won instrumentalist of

411
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,079
the night really for his flute playing

412
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,639
that's awesome so he was already you

413
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,279
know he was already spotted as being a

414
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,839
talent and I think the judges were uh

415
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,800
Pete Chris Le who was one of the studio

416
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,920
uh I think a flute or a sax player okay

417
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,120
okay uh Tom Scott uh um uh Mercer

418
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,680
Ellington who was Duke Ellington's son

419
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,319
all right and some other you know like

420
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,000
an industry heavyweight was there and

421
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:40,759
they were the judges that's great at the

422
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,199
bowl so that was pretty cool anyway we

423
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,720
we gradually as we as they graduated

424
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,680
high school we did one more thing and

425
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,199
this is like June of 75 long time

426
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,560
between these things that we recorded

427
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:53,600
for Dr dendo we did Mr ghost Goes to

428
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,040
Town uhuh and sent that in and that got

429
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,399
played so good and still gets played

430
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,399
every couple of Halloweens mhm and after

431
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,079
that we didn't do much musically you

432
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,160
know I I want to say that was my first

433
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,360
group r&t unlimited or actually we

434
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,639
called ourselves Pursuit okay by the

435
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,000
time we were doing the Hollywood Bowl

436
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,440
thing it was Pursuit MH and within a few

437
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,120
years after that we sort of all went our

438
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,759
separate ways Somebody went to school or

439
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,560
I went got a job or whatever it was

440
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,519
anyway

441
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,639
um but I I wasn't in another group like

442
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,399
really in a group until maybe 7879 I met

443
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,079
some guys and uh met a gentleman named

444
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,959

with them I was doing a lot of Demos in

450
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,519
the in the late 70s around town and I'd

451
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,279
run into these guys and I can't remember

452
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,440
how I met them but we wound up doing

453
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,720
this group called Nipper uhhuh and we

454
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,279
did all the new wave clubs around town

455
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,959
that's awesome made nothing mhm you know

456
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,679
put put together made up a single and uh

457
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,959
I did up the artwork for the single now

458
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,559
back then I you know we didn't have

459
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,480
computers this is like 1980 so no

460
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,160
computers no Photoshop you know not not

461
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,039
for me MH so literally I was doing rub

462
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,439
on letters lret really buy a big sheet

463
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,959
of of letters and and you know there'd

464
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,559
be like you know in in a very limited

465
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,959
selection of type faces and you get a

466
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,640
whole font you know all the characters

467
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,520
in this particular type face Pioneer

468
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,840
helvetica you know stuff like that there

469
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,039
were maybe a dozen that you could get

470
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,600
yeah and I have I had this nylon

471
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,160
burnishing tool you know with kind of a

472
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,520
little bit of a soft point on it that

473
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,640
you could actually rub the letter on and

474
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,960
completely rub it on okay I knew how to

475
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,679
Drew draw blue lines cuz when you shot

476
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,679
it to be reproduced the blue would

477
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,400
disappear show up right yeah and and it

478
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,880
was all very and so I did all the

479
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,760
layouts for that I I did the photos

480
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,600
again no help from Photoshop developed

481
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,000
photos and cut them up and lined them up

482
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,480
and did this whole thing and put

483
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
together all the art for the label and

484
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,880
and the artwork on a sleeve for the

485
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,520
single that's great we did uh so even

486
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,200
then I was sort of involved a little bit

487
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,679
in the logistics of of uh doing stuff MH

488
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,679

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,520
very kind of a a little niche thing and

524
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,760
tucked away but you know didn't

525
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,400

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,919
time that's crazy which is huge of

539
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,320
course and that's that's really where

540
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,120
things took off that's not just I don't

541
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,799
want to downplay Al's Capital single

542
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,600
from a year before my bologa came out in

543
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:15,760
December of 79 MH a One-Shot Capital

544
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,320
deal yeah uh very Niche thing yeah but

545
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,880
you know is that single one that's

546
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,559
available like that people or is that

547
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,919
more the collector's item version well

548
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,000
it's collector's item now yeah yeah yeah

549
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,840
but it's uh they're out there I mean

550
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,679
Capital distributed it it was out in

551
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,120
other countries I mean it was a

552
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,080
legitimate issue but it was strictly a

553
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,400
novel yeah a novelty thing and I don't

554
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,200
think they or Al thought it would go any

555
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,080
further it was a one shot deal that's

556
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,799
interesting uh in fact I I guess when it

557
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,679
came time to shop labels they must have

558
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,799
gone back and talked to capital and

559
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,919
capital probably said nah we've we

560
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,559
already put some out on him enough

561
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,080
already with with the

562
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:55,600
accordion and uh so Al Al telling me you

563
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,919
know about you know this is taken off

564
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,440
I've got somebody I've got a manager uh

565
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,919
I'm going to be home in January I want

566
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,600
to get back together we want to record a

567
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,480
few things we put out an EP and you know

568
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,679
let's let's do this MH so he did and we

569
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,120
did and

570
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,159
uh I didn't do the artwork on this this

571
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,039
time he had uh he and a buddy of his

572
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,440
photographer friend named Bill Burke

573
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,919
also known as beff Bill uhuh uh did the

574
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,679
photography and I think the layout uh no

575
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,360
l set this time well actually there was

576
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,559
some but but the back of it was a lot of

577
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,640
hand hand uh you know hand drawn text

578
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,960
mhm and uh that's a very rare that's

579
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,440
that's on the placebo label okay and

580
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,120
that's a very rare they did a thousand

581
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,080
of them and in fact I drove Al our alen

582
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,080
I drove all over town and went to re

583
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,679
Rhino records and music pluses and Tower

584
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,440
Records and stuff and dropped off you

585
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,960
know can can we drop off five of these

586
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,840
singles you know 10 of these singles

587
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,159
anyway and and up until recently I know

588
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,799
Al was still sitting on a hundred of

589
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,640
them so there's not that many out there

590
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,919
oh my God that's not the rarest thing

591
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
that would have on yeah but I mean

592
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,640
probably the rarest things are the Dr

593
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,880
Demento shows where there would be well

594
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,080
the rare ones are on real toore tape yes

595
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,720
yeah but but he was airing on 170 180

596
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,520
radio stations back in the 80s and

597
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,000
Westwood one who was a syndicator would

598
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,600
literally press up that many um they

599
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,600
would duplicate that many tapes or later

600
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,080
press up that many sets of LPS yeah a

601
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,159
dozen extras so they would do like 190

602
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,000
or

603
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,240
195 shows mhm and that was it yeah so

604
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,159
that's that's a a much lower number

605
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,480
obviously than a thousand sure and plus

606
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,960
those are spread out across the country

607
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,279
so those are really hard to find I have

608
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,200
every one of them do you wow but uh

609
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,679
where where Al is interviewed or the

610
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,000
funny 25 show as well are are archivable

611
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,400
I think yeah I I've noticed that around

612
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,559
at least at record Surplus in Santa

613
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,880
Monica every once in a while you can

614
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,799
find some dementos but nothing that I

615
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,240
again i' I'd be looking for weirdo like

616
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,120
that would specifically be what I'd be

617
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,640
looking for yeah it's it's uh well every

618
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,039
every show that uh and later on CD uh

619
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,640
every show that had an interview I think

620
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,840
qualifies as something that's worth you

621
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,840
know you could I mean Al was played on

622
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,360
probably every show since 1976 yeah yeah

623
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,919
you know it would be you know you can't

624
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,360
put them all in the archive course just

625
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,120
it's that's two nuts yeah yeah but an

626
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,840
interview is a special thing or an

627
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,360
appearance in the the the funny 25 or

628
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,279
the funny 50 or whatever it is the end

629
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,120
of the year show is a special thing yeah

630
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,559
uh so those are in the archive and I

631
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,159
have copies of all of those now having

632
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:29,400
worked at Westwood one that was an easy

633
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:32,080
thing for me to do okay took one off the

634
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,559
top of course why not what was do you

635
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,159
know I've never been able to talk to

636
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,880
anybody who listened to Demento from the

637
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,159
beginning I I talked to people who lived

638
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,600
in different parts of the country I

639
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,080
never got to hear it I didn't know who

640
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,760
Dr Demento was till high school and

641
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,320
somebody gave me a CD that it was a

642
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,120
compilation and uh so what was Demento

643
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,440
show before people were submitting stuff

644
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,600
that's what I always think of as people

645
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,120
submitting stuff well it was you know

646
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,760
he's he's very much of a of a

647
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,440
musicologist I mean extremely

648
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,679
knowledgeable uh uh old Jazz and you

649
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,760
know really the history of of 20th

650
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,799
century music yeah is is his thing

651
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,120
there's a lot of kind of one hit I I

652
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,279
don't want to call him one hit wonders

653
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,679
but a lot of sort of novelty things but

654
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,480
a lot of very cool obscure Jazz stuff so

655
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,240
a lot of the stuff he played he played

656
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,840
old Vaudeville things okay uh you know

657
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,360
or or things from the ' 50s 40s you know

658
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,960
some some big band stuff a little bit

659
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,320
but with a leaning towards the novel and

660
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,279
novel being both comedic and also rare

661
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,039
yeah uh so it was It was a very uh you

662
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,080
know it wasn't just a lot of wacky stuff

663
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,000
and I mean the show did eventually

664
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,399
become a lot of just sort of wacky it

665
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,399
really focused on the comedy I'm not

666
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:41,279
saying that's a bad thing sure it's just

667
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,399
it it evolved throughout the 80s uh

668
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,120
throughout the 80s throughout the 70s

669
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:49,039
rather uh in fact by the

670
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,960
time I got to meet Dr Demento and and

671
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,960
was asked if I would do an interview it

672
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,080
was you know was in the summer of 1980

673
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,399
he asked and and it was because at this

674
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,640
point his show you know was comprised of

675
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,960
a lot of stuff that people send in you

676
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,600
know in fact a lot of well-known uh well

677
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,600
Al was one of them yeah uh you know but

678
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,399
I was one of the I was very early on it

679
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,760
was like me Ogden

680
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:16,600
edel that's

681
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,080
it probably you know in in in 73 it was

682
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,760
you know I mean so and and also of

683
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,679
course I was playing around town at the

684
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,640
time with Nippers so Dr dendo thought

685
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,039
well I could give that a little bit of a

686
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,360
plug but it might be cool to get one of

687
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,480
the early people on there yeah that's

688
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,760
anyway and of course I I met Al and and

689
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,840
Another One Rides the Bus and the whole

690
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,960
you know all beer drummer thing mhm so

691
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,960
uh uh but his show was it it had a very

692
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,880
different tone early on uh but he would

693
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,760
play you know the Flying Saucer records

694
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,559
you know Buchanan and Goodman um you

695
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,960
know other the Stan freeberg now Stan

696
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:54,399
was a huge hero to Al yeah and uh yeah

697
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,080
Spike Jones you know so it was all very

698
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:58,399
kind of cool

699
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,720
stuff but with with a leaning towards

700
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:01,520
the novel but there'd be some old

701
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,640
there'd be big sperbeck stuff I mean

702
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,080
there'd be some very cool old Jazz stuff

703
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,000
you know 20s and 30s stuff yeah so it

704
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,679
was It was kind of all over the place

705
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,640
and later you know by by the mid to late

706
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,399
'70s it had become focused on Comedy and

707
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,240
Novelty yeah and with a leaning towards

708
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,760
you know a lot of sort of independent or

709
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,720
SL homemade uh music you know again of

710
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,399
which Al was one sure and uh and uh he

711
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,840
had become the most requested artist on

712
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:33,399
the show I mean perhaps even before the

713
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,159
the record deal you know I I I think

714
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:37,720
because because Dr dedo's fan base knew

715
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,039
who Al was yeah he was the resident

716
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,080
songwriter yeah the you know he was on

717
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:44,360
on the show you know almost every week

718
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,640
right you know he did PSAs he answered

719
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,159
phones he would uh you know just say

720
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,120
wacky stuff you he was just sort of one

721
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,559
of the cast members along with jungle

722
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,520
Judy and and musical Mike and and

723
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,799
Captain Chaos and some of you know the

724
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,600
other ludicrous Lori you life-size Lynn

725
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,880
I mean it was all and and after I met Al

726
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,360
I sort of became I I I would come down

727
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,039
every week or two or three and and

728
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,240
answer phones and just sort of be there

729
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,840
sometimes whether Al was there or not

730
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,360
and and for a short time you know for a

731
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,000
year maybe I guess I was sort of one of

732
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,279
the cast members that's great but not to

733
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,640
the extent that you know that that Mike

734
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,520
and and Damascus and some of them were

735
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,399
you know Sulu Su Luben uh who married a

736
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,600
guy named duboff so so she became sudu

737
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:34,440
instead of

738
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,799
Sulu or Sulu do I guess Sulu dashd how

739
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,919
did how did your work with Al Escape

740
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:43,120
being novelty when or when and was it

741
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,799
conscious like because it it definitely

742
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,000
did it's it's it's its own thing now

743
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:51,480
it's it's its own thing and and I guess

744
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,360
the the parent genre is novelty but that

745
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,600
includes satire yeah and and uh you know

746
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,960
and comedy comedy is not necessarily

747
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,519
novelty oh but but it's novel in that I

748
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,080
guess it has a uh sort of a narrow

749
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,600
appeal although you know judging by you

750
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,919
know the thousands of people that come

751
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,919
to see us every night you wouldn't think

752
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,960
it's that narrow yeah yeah yeah yeah uh

753
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,200
I mean there's some major big bands that

754
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,039
are out there you know that are well

755
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,360
respected that you know would love to

756
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,080
play some of the venues we do yeah yeah

757
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,960
but again this is after years and years

758
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,760
and years after Decades of building a

759
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,120
following and we've hung on to that

760
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,880
following and and I and it's not because

761
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,600
it's novel it's just because it's good

762
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,919
yeah and uh I remember the first time it

763
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,880
was 99 is the first time we videoed the

764
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:41,320
show to produce a a product to produce a

765
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,840
live concert VHS and DVD MH and I and

766
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,799
it's very hard to tell on stage I mean

767
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,559
you can put a camera out front and and

768
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,440
shoot the show you know just have kind

769
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,919
of a a one view of the show and the

770
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,240
audience noise and get a little bit of a

771
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,519
sense of what it is but you really you

772
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,799
never know but in watching this properly

773
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,080
mixed and edited camera work and proper

774
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,200
lighting and everyone doing a really

775
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,440
good show that night yeah I really got a

776
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,200
sense of of what it is that that people

777
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
you know why they come to the the show

778
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,039
multiple times you it's the same show

779
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,279
why would you come several times right

780
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,840
it's a good show well it's like if you

781
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,600
like a certain TV show or a certain

782
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,159
movie or something you may watch it

783
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,399
several times of course you know I mean

784
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,559
I still watch I Love Lucy yeah you know

785
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:20,679
when it's on and and bewitched and you

786
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,880
know it's stuff I've seen you know

787
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,080
Columbo episodes you know it's it's

788
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,519
stuff I've seen to death yeah and I

789
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,240
watch them because I like them it's like

790
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,000
God this and I'm watching us do our show

791
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,080
from an angle that I never see it sure

792
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,399
yeah and thinking I I get white people

793
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,039
this is actually very good yeah even

794
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,039
though I'm I'm in it I can I can

795
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,039
separate myself and it's like this is I

796
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,000
I would go see this maybe not 20 times

797
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,559
you know on the same show but sure sure

798
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,200
you know you know once or twice or three

799
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,760
times would be plenty but it's very very

800
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,159
good and the same thing again when we

801
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,480
did in 2011 we did the apocalypse tour

802
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,880
MH on uh actually at the beginning of

803
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,039
that tour we we made a video of the tour

804
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
that went on sale almost immed

805
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,440
immediately it's like well do I go to

806
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,960
the show or do I buy buy a DVD well I'll

807
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,120
go to the show and buy the DVD there of

808
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,360
course of course and and uh I watched

809
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,080
that and it's like yeah it's still I get

810
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,279
it I know why I know why it's grown MH

811
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,080
and uh and it's still you know and uh

812
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:16,600
well that was only a few years ago and

813
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,399
it continues to grow I mean we've you

814
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,519
know it's not an accident that we're

815
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,799
playing some of the biggest and most

816
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,840
important venues of our career yeah and

817
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,039
and the kind of classic venues that

818
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,200
major acts play I mean the Hollywood

819
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,320

right you know we we we've done that

822
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,320

have been playing clubs sure yeah yeah

824
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,000
yeah but we've grown and it's it's

825
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,760
always it's yet to level off MH and and

826
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,960
we'll see uh what the future brings you

827
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,559
know the the plan is to go out in 2018

828
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,679
MH uh for for a while and uh the show is

829
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:53,320
going to

830
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,760
be I don't think Al made a secret of it

831
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,760
it's going to be primarily Originals oh

832
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,760
God are you kidding me our are Originals

833
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,960
yeah are you kidding me no that's what

834
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,639
you know that's this is this is it's for

835
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,679
the fans it's it's for the the fans who

836
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:08,399
have let us know it's like you guys

837
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,320
don't do enough Originals well we got 14

838
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,600
albums worth of parodies yeah you know

839
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,399
with with a single or two or three from

840
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,240
some of them that we have to there's not

841
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:18,519
a whole lot of room for Originals of

842
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,080
course you know and we don't want to go

843
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:23,679
up and play for five hours yep yep so we

844
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,080
we've uh so the balance of parodies to

845
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,919
uh to the the ratio to Originals is is

846
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,360
pretty high yeah that's changing yeah uh

847
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,279
in 2018 gosh that's amazing uh there'll

848
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,080
be some parodies but it's primarily uh

849
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,120
uh originals and we're also and again AL

850
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,000
has kind of made this known uh no

851
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:48,240
costumes no video no backing tracks you

852
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,679
know no percussion Loops or we are just

853
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,320
playing and for For Better or Worse holy

854
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,200
crap and we're just playing like we used

855
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,120
to do a long time ago uh you know and

856
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,440
I'll just I I wear what I'm wearing now

857
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,320
we a t-shirt or whatever you know if I

858
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,639
don't want to shave I don't have to

859
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,559
shave and we'll just

860
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:09,279
do a concert you know it's not the show

861
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,600
it's a concert yeah oh my gosh and I

862
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,639
think the fans are going to dig that

863
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,720
because that because we're going to play

864
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,760
stuff we're going to play stuff that

865
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,159
we've never played as a bandh yeah I was

866
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,000
wondering that like there has to been

867
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,880
there have to have been a few things

868
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,399
that have just never popped up on stage

869
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,000
right just Studio oh there a lot of

870
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,519
stuff we've never played Crazy a lot of

871
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,760
things we haven't played in a long time

872
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,519
yeah and a lot of stuff coming up I mean

873
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,000
I already know there's a list of 50 60

874
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,840
songs

875
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,960
and no we're not playing 50 songs a

876
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,000
night what that means is it's going to

877
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,200
be different show every night yeah yeah

878
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,720
and that's also that's also the lure so

879
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,159
people that are like you know they want

880
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,679
to come to see the show because they

881
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,840
like seeing the show they're going to

882
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,039
come now because they know they're going

883
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,720
to see something different than they did

884
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,639
last night of course of course uh so

885
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,679
when we're in a region uh we're going to

886
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,399
have a lot of repeat business yeah just

887
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,840
so they can hear the different the

888
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,919
different things we're going to do I

889
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,559
mean in

890
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,480
theory no no show will be like you know

891
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,760
every show will be unique yeah to some

892
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,360
extent I mean every time we talk about

893
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,399
your music on the show which has of

894
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,880
course happened plenty of times in 3D is

895
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,120
the first album that we've ever we ever

896
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,279
talked about because my best friend and

897
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,639
I became friends over that album like

898
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,880
this is that that's the reason I started

899
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:15,240
the podcast is this damn album and I

900
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,559
love it so much but that's the one thing

901
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,480
that comes up is every nerd that I talk

902
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,440
to we're all nerds it's just like why

903
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,559
does nobody talk about the originals and

904
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,960
it is like just a huge thing I think for

905
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,200
like maybe it's a badge of honor maybe

906
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,919
it's just like well you don't really

907
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,720
know weird now unless you know you know

908
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,840
originals and my phone's on that's super

909
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:36,240
classy that was really great turn that

910
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,519
off um that is almost never happened um

911
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,080
but yeah I mean that's the thing is

912
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,840
those originals are just so hugely

913
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,240
important and I my next question was

914
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,760
going to be about does it get is it

915
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,840
weird for you having to play somebody

916
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,440
else's song essentially even though and

917
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,559
and do you make it your own can you make

918
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,600
it your own I don't know what it's like

919
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,399
well for on the parodies yeah uh no it's

920
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,760
it's not weird for me no at all uh

921
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,159
what's weird is sometimes in one of my

922
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,519
other bands I'll be playing a song that

923
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,880
we've parody okay yeah and and now I'm

924
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,320
hearing some and very often we'll make a

925
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,720
change of arrangement stuff like that so

926
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,560
uh you know there's one of my bands

927
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,159
plays uh uh I love rock and roll now we

928
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,159
happen to do the exact arrangement of

929
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,960
that song yeah and I and I know the

930
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,720
exact you know of course I don't even

931
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:29,159
have to think about it yeah but we also

932
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:32,119
do uh uh American Idiot mhm mhm mhm and

933
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,919
and they do it much more like Green Day

934
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,119
okay that Arrangement and I have to

935
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,480
really think about that yeah and and

936
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,960
it's weird even though it's the same

937
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,599
part and it's pretty close to what I've

938
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,960
been doing for years I really have to

939
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:43,839
think about it because it's not that

940
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,119
familiar to me okay because it's now

941
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,480
it's like I'm not hearing the words I'm

942
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,520
used to hearing yeah so I I actually

943
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,000
have to think about that I'm on my toes

944
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,960
with that one or if somebody wants to do

945
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,320
uh god um well there's there's a number

946
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
of the songs you know a lot of the older

947
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,200
songs where these bands will play the

948
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,839
original version of it and and I like to

949
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,760
think I'm up to speed on it but you know

950
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm not always now with Al's Originals

951
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,000
when we're doing those Originals those I

952
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,000
have somewhat made those my own because

953
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,800
in a lot of cases I mean well in every

954
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,119
case those are my parts yeah so if if I

955
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,240
like the parts I played on the record

956
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,880
and I usually do those are the parts I

957
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,839
play sometimes if we played a song for

958
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,640
years and years and years it's you know

959
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:24,440
something will occur to me oh I wish I

960
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,040
had done this instead you know I'm going

961
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,320
to start playing this just a little bit

962
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,720
of a change up and you know but not

963
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,359
something I could have done at the time

964
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,200
sure you know not something you know it

965
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,160
takes years sometimes to have a part

966
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,800
occur to me that it's like oh that would

967
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,119
have been nice you know if I'd had

968
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,960
several years to think about it before

969
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,839
recording it but sometimes we only had

970
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,240
several weeks Al would present a song

971
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,400
it's like okay hurry up and figure out

972
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,880
the parts you want to do and those are

973
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,920
going to be the parts forever yeah

974
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,800
that's going to be committed to you know

975
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,400
some media for all eternity so so make

976
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,920
it good it's like I don't know you know

977
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,319
I mean I'm pretty happy with with the

978
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,680
stuff I did it's couple things I would

979
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:02,720
do different but you know not to the

980
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,119
extent that you know I don't agonize

981
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,280
over it I wouldn't re-record it if given

982
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,560
the opportunity sure sure you know

983
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,480
although that would be interesting to go

984
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,880
in and re-record an album of of

985
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,920
originals and just with today's slant on

986
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,640
it now interestingly we

987
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,119
did the movie that came out last week I

988
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,359
think how to be a Latin lover uhuh with

989
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:30,880
uh there's he's a major Latin star named

990
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:37,000
I I called him Eugene mhm it's AO okay

991
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:39,200
uh uh verdez F God I can't even anyway

992
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,960
Eugenio and and this is like his first

993
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,520
movie geared towards the American Market

994
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,400
towards the English speaking market and

995
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,520
it actually was like the number two

996
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,280
movie last week and it and it's like

997
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,760
number four this week or something I

998
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,319
it's really hanging in there wonderful

999
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,280
well we had a little bit of a cameo in

1000
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:57,079
there there's an outdoor scene there's a

1001
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,200
birthday party MH and they wanted to use

1002
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,760
the song happy birthday mhm which

1003
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,160
ironically was the very first real thing

1004
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,000
I recorded with Al you know

1005
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,839
intentionally not not got sucked into it

1006
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
like Another One Rides to the bus but

1007
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,640
where we got together and said okay

1008
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
we're doing a song named happy birthday

1009
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,760
today um and and I think the deal was

1010
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,680
they didn't want to license the original

1011
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,440
recording H from Sony or or it would

1012
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,040
have cost too much okay of course every

1013
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,800
movie claims to be on a budget sure and

1014
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,760
so we went in and

1015
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,240
re-recorded uh happy birthday birthday

1016
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:35,119
Allah the you know the first album

1017
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:37,720
version wow as closely you know as

1018
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,520
closely as we could yeah including Al

1019
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,839
Al's lyric about there's an Arab on

1020
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,960
every corner uhhuh I was going to ask

1021
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,520
about that line today that's that's uh

1022
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,680
oh that's in there cuz that's the lyric

1023
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,440
yeah it's the lyric you know that's and

1024
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,040
and it uh it sounded pretty good yeah it

1025
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,680
sound and that's the version used in the

1026
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,359
movie that's amazing that's to the

1027
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,240

of the four of us and the core band and

1056
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,280
uh it it was it it was pretty cool uh

1057
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,720
you know it's it's neat being involved

1058
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,920
with the label and it's not my first

1059
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,280

1084
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,040
all the album covers that are being

1085
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:21,960
reproduced for for the Set uh I mean

1086
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,480

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,839
they no idea of course of course that's

1089
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:30,839
so I

1090
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,160

1092
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,720

1093
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,400

the same people that listen to the Dr

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,800
dedo show were also fans of the same

1126
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,440
things credibility gap yeah oh gosh I

1127
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,240
love so much I mean I I I knew all of

1128
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,640
that stuff yeah uh not So Much Anymore

1129
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,319
SK Proctor was in here uh just this

1130
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,720
weekend actually and we interviewed him

1131
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,000
about don't crush that dwarf we're doing

1132
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,480
like one album at a time with him and

1133
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,040
that's a ton of and I I had his his

1134
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,240
buddy who's an archive is here and every

1135
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,839
story you're telling me now is just the

1136
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,079
same kind of crap he has to deal with to

1137
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,200
do fire sign stuff and get that going

1138
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,400
and that is so overwhelming but like

1139
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,800
that's clearly so well I guess my I was

1140
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,599
going to ask like how involved I'm

1141
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,760
assuming Al writes everything but then

1142
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,680
that could be a completely ignorant

1143
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,200
assumption he writes absolutely

1144
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,960
everything he he does well certainly

1145
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,800
lyrically yes lyrically and and

1146
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,920
musically on The Originals of course uh

1147
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,920
there are certain there are certain

1148
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,880
things they'll specify for each of us uh

1149
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,480
sometimes there's times he'll say just

1150
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,200
you know it's going to sound like this

1151
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,520
you know the drill you know what to do

1152
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,240
right uh so I mean he's he gives

1153
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,960
direction of course as he should he's

1154
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,079
the artist the writer and the producer

1155
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,680
sure uh and and the payroll clerk so he

1156
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,240
he uh you know he's the boss he's the

1157
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,440
man the guy the one the kid yeah uh so

1158
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,760
yes he should be telling us what he

1159
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,319
wants but it just depends to what extent

1160
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,440
sometimes he really wants something very

1161
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,280
specific I need a specific base part

1162
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,760
here I need a specific little keyboard I

1163
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,599
want a specific drum fill here you know

1164
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,000
or or I want it to sound like this but I

1165
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,880
don't want what they did on that album

1166
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,119
you know that we're sort of alluding to

1167
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,359
I don't want it to sound like we're just

1168
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,760
stealing from that right so in a lot of

1169
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,520
cases you know and with with all of us

1170
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,720
we have to sort of on The Originals put

1171
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,359
ourselves when we're doing what came to

1172
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,839
be known as Style parodies whether the

1173
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,240
doors or white stripes or whoever it is

1174
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,000
uh we have to put ourselves in the

1175
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,760
mindset of those players what would they

1176
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,880
do if they were coming in you know what

1177
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,359
would John denmore the doors drummer do

1178
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,119
if he was coming in to play on

1179
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:44,839
Craigslist and told I want you to sound

1180
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,359
like you're playing with the doors but I

1181
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:48,160
don't want you to necessarily play what

1182
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:49,960
you played with the doors but I want

1183
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,880
people to think that it sounds like

1184
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,599
something you would have played and

1185
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,200
that's what I had to do yeah was I had

1186
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,800
to be John Densmore for a day yeah and

1187
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,880
without being him I had to allude to him

1188
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,680
and and I mean there's only so much you

1189
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,720
can't do you know there's some things

1190
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,720
you have to do there's production value

1191
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,119
that lends itself to those things

1192
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,520
there's some

1193
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,160
signature Parts you know but you know

1194
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:18,000
without trying to just copy a particular

1195
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,800
song yeah so you know Craigslist had you

1196
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,960
know some very obvious writers in the

1197
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:26,599
storm you kind of thing going on etc etc

1198
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,240
uh so so in doing the originals you know

1199
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,640
sometimes we're left to her own devices

1200
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,040
and and uh you know but Al has the final

1201
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,559
say on everything and yes he does you

1202
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,960
know he writes everything he may ask for

1203
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,520
an opinion well which line do you like

1204
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,760
better do you like this line or do you

1205
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,280
like this line or or if I say this word

1206
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:51,079
in this line uh like he said uh in

1207
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,440
uh God it it was

1208
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,760
uh first world problems there was an

1209
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,800
original line and I have it on his

1210
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,800
original demo something something thing

1211
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,960
about butt hurt MH and he says to me

1212
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,960
says do you know what butt hurt means

1213
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,839
and at the time I didn't I said um no I

1214
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,559
suppose I could Google it must be the

1215
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:12,640
kids are probably saying that it turns

1216
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,040
out they were uhhuh yeah you know and he

1217
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,760
knew that but it's just like well with

1218
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,400
somebody who's you know yeah you're an

1219
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,720
old fogy but you're also involved in the

1220
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,920
Arts and you listen to a lot of music

1221
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,280
would you possibly know the reference

1222
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,680
and I didn't and he pulled that line wow

1223
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,960
he changed it to something else yeah uh

1224
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,559
for me yeah yeah yeah I wish he left it

1225
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,599
in now I know what it means now it would

1226
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,559
be very funny perhaps if we do that song

1227
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,599
live there we go uh you know he'll put

1228
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,079
the original lyric back in I mean he's

1229
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,839
welcome to change the lyrics on his own

1230
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,079
songs you of course they're his songs of

1231
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:44,880
course some sometimes if he uh it

1232
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,079
doesn't happen often you know but once

1233
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,440
every four or five or six shows on on a

1234
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,079
parody he'll like he'll forget a lyric

1235
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,760
but that doesn't mean he stops singing

1236
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:58,200
yeah he'll say something

1237
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,280
else and sometimes sometimes it fits and

1238
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,079
it's funny and sometimes he just

1239
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,599
stumbles his way through it but more

1240
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,760
often than not he puts in like just a

1241
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,400
different lyric that it's like well that

1242
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,760
works hey you know what why did you he

1243
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,480
says it's my song I'll change the lyrics

1244
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,319
if I want okay I mean I know how excited

1245
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,280
I am to see you guys live and I probably

1246
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,240
wouldn't notice I'd be just too high on

1247
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,200
how amazing the show is you know but the

1248
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,440
but the fans know because they're

1249
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,839
singing along sure sure and all of a

1250
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,480
sudden Al saying something different

1251
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:27,839
like Al forgot Al forgot the

1252
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,400
lyrics he he saying something even

1253
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,079
funnier this time right and I mean I

1254
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,000
guess that's my question is if if you're

1255
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,480
obviously so heavily involved regardless

1256
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,720
of you don't have to write the song to

1257
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,200
have left your stamp on it or to to

1258
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,400
enjoy it to to actually to have it be a

1259
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,960
piece of art for you you know but you're

1260
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,079
also so invested that you're the archist

1261
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,359
so you must love it so much maybe even

1262
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,359
more than any of us fans can appreciate

1263
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:56,599
well because that's a lot of work you

1264
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,839
know I I I didn't start out deliberately

1265
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:01,440
doing that I just always did that with

1266
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:03,440
all of my groups I mean I have with this

1267
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,559
group Nipper I have a whole box full of

1268

I got you know posters we did I mean

1275
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,079
I've got all of that stuff it was just

1276
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,720
something I did when Al came along it

1277
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:26,920
was just something I did yeah you know I

1278
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:29,760
the the very the night I met him I

1279
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,680
started archiving yeah I had uh uh to

1280
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,960
enter metr media Square which was the

1281
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,760
owner of uh Channel 11 at the time mhm

1282
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,280
and kme uh the mighty met Metro media

1283
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,599
was uh was housed there as well it was

1284
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,880
sunset and the uh uh Hollywood freeway

1285
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:49,200
in Hollywood uh and and you know it was

1286
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,119
sort of a secure facility even back then

1287
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,280
so you had an access card a little

1288
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,559
handwritten pass for the night and Dr

1289
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,000
dedo had a bunch of those sort of

1290
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,599
pre-signed so he he uh would write them

1291
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,440
out for the people that were coming that

1292
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,319
night we would meet him he would hand us

1293
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,559
the cards so if anyone we saw anyone in

1294
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,640
the inside it's like okay I've got my

1295
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:11,440
card I'm I'm okay to be here I I kept

1296
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,359
that card you know even that first night

1297
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,599
yeah even though it was just a chance

1298
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,599
meeting I still have that card and it's

1299
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,040
in perfect condition it's amazing I mean

1300
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,079
it's absolutely pristine I love it and

1301
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,440
so the night I met him I began archiving

1302
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,960
yeah and everything we did uh you I

1303
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,599
always had a camera with me I didn't

1304
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,680
have one that night as turns out uh on

1305
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:32,400
on subsequent visits to the show I did

1306
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,480
but every time we were in the studio

1307
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:39,559
every gig every tour rehearsals MH uh TV

1308
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,920
shows everything I always had a camera

1309
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:44,880
and uh I just took photos endlessly

1310
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,200
sometimes I had two cameras one had you

1311
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,440
know slrs one had the black and white

1312
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:53,640
film uh the Manola SRT 101 which is an

1313
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,920
older camera by the80s uh had black and

1314
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,599
white and that was a real Workhorse and

1315
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,240
I had a Canon one program uh that I shot

1316
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,200
color mhm and I had some different

1317
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,400
lenses but I had a big camera case that

1318
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,480
had all my gear in it and it went

1319
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,440
everywhere with me on the road and of

1320
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,839
course in order to see the pictures as

1321
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,960
as we went along I had to go to a lot of

1322
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:15,200
1our Photoshop of course yeah and I

1323
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,400
always got two sets of photos MH one to

1324
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,760
keep and one to to hand out yeah you

1325
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,200
know or or one to put in my box of

1326
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,839
photos there was there were the AL

1327
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,520
photos and there were the me photos so

1328
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,079
depending who was in the photo you know

1329
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,760
one set just went into the archive and

1330
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,200
the other set got handed out and you

1331
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,400
know maybe any extras went into my

1332
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,000
another photo album I had yeah so it was

1333
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,359
a very expensive Pursuit Of course

1334
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,760
looking back of course uh you know I was

1335
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,559
always like I never had the luxury of

1336
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,040
doing stuff overnight because we were

1337
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,520
always on the move and I would shoot you

1338
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,359
know 20 30 rolls of film during the

1339
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:51,559
course of a short tour M you know to two

1340
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:53,520
three rolls a week maybe so uh it was an

1341
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:56,240
expensive an expensive deal before I

1342
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,200
knew how to write things off right oh

1343
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,799
gosh

1344
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,240
I wish I could go back it's too far to

1345
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:05,000
go back and revise my taxes but uh and

1346
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,559
I've got all of those photos every

1347
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,240
stinking single photo yeah is in a box

1348
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,920
in order in a box in several boxes in

1349
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,720
order there are the Weird Al boxes there

1350
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,680
are the Mi boxes there's a little bit of

1351
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,079
crossover between the two but there was

1352
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,760
a point where I realized you know

1353
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,599
doesn't matter which box they go into I

1354
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,680
I'll be able to find it MH you know I

1355
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,520
don't need duplicates you know if I'm in

1356
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,400
a photo with Al does it go in his box or

1357
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,280
mine well after a certain point it just

1358
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:33,040
went in mind yeah and and I I I know to

1359
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,720
find it later and at this point after

1360
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,760
going through the collection of photos

1361
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,440
and posters and all the other stuff for

1362
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:43,400

1369
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:06,200
thousands of my photos for this booklet

1370
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,640
obviously they're not using them all in

1371
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,119
in doing that most of the stuff I've got

1372
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,040
has been digitized more than once

1373
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,160
scanned digitized or there was a point

1374
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,559
where they were just all digital yeah uh

1375
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,200
I went through recently and and

1376
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,359
reordered all of my photos I had an

1377
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,680
interesting experience with uh with the

1378
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:27,480
guy who put together the uh the uh Weird

1379
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,520
Al book uhuh with with us and Nathan uh

1380
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,880
Nathan Raven yes yes and he came over to

1381
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,599
my house for a couple of weekends went

1382
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,880
through all my stuff with me wow uh went

1383
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,839
to Al's house went through all of his

1384
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,240
stuff but he went through every photo in

1385
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:45,559
my collection oh my that had there unto

1386
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,799
been in order mhm and they got seriously

1387
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:49,040
out of order he would group them and

1388
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:50,640
stack them then like just gather them up

1389
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,599
and stick them back in the Box more or

1390
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,400
less within the year that of you know

1391
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,319
the index card for that year mhm and

1392
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,200
they had been that way ever since

1393
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:01,400
they've been that way for over 5 years

1394
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,960
now MH except when I needed to find

1395
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,160
something for Sony just like last week

1396
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,520
and it's like okay I need to find

1397
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,119
something from this video shoot I'm

1398
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,720
going to go look for it yeah and I

1399
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:13,000
realized was reminded how out of order

1400
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,040
everything was I thought okay that's it

1401
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,680
and I spent two solid days putting

1402
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,280
everything back in order oh my and I

1403
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,920
realized it was then I could I could

1404
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,760
tell a very obviously cut off when

1405
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,240
things went digital mhm after which

1406
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,880
maybe 2003 was the last year I had any

1407
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,480
kind of real photos mhm okay and after

1408
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,359
that there were some years I had no hard

1409
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,720
copies at all yeah none uh I think the

1410
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:38,160
most recent hard copy photo I've got one

1411
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,559
photo from

1412
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,839
2012 uh that somebody else gave me okay

1413
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,680
that's but but 2003 to 2004 was the cuto

1414
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,799
off where I went 100% digital and I I'd

1415
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,000
already been using a digital camera but

1416
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:51,280
uh I've been through so many digital

1417
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,400
cameras because the quality just gets

1418
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,599
better and better MH but at this point

1419
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,119
hopefully I don't have to go through all

1420
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,760
those photos again photos again

1421
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:00,839
everything that's worth seeing I think

1422
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,200
has been scanned and digitized and

1423
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,680
cataloged and and renamed in order with

1424
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,400
the photographer's name on it you know

1425
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,000
usually me yeah and and hopefully now

1426
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,480
this stuff's been digitized to the point

1427
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,400
where I don't have to touch another

1428
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,799
photo of course you know now that now

1429
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,839
that I've put them all in meticulous

1430
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:18,400
order it's probably the last time I have

1431
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,599
to refer to them yeah but uh yeah that's

1432
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,280
the extent to which I take my archiving

1433
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:25,799
very seriously and it's not just photos

1434
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,280
MH it's Al's product mhm or product that

1435
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:30,240
has anal reference M there there are a

1436
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,400
lot of albums CDs where Al has been

1437
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,760
thanked for one reason if his name

1438
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,040
appears on it I get a copy yeah I buy it

1439
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,400
or I mooch one or whatever or I refer to

1440
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,400
it at least in the discography if I

1441
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,040
can't get one sure and I still discover

1442
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,880
some I keep on top of it pretty well uh

1443
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,200
these days but I still occasionally

1444
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,119
discover something that's like God I got

1445
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,760
to get that or or how didn't I know

1446
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,960
about that just five years ago you know

1447
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,599
when the internet you know would allow

1448
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,640
me to find it of course of course 20

1449
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,480
years ago I I I don't know how I knew

1450
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,960
all those things you know I mean I was

1451
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,040
online 20 years ago but it just it

1452
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,839
wasn't the resource that it is now yeah

1453
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:08,640
so I've got a collection of product from

1454
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:11,960
around the world uh video audio um promo

1455
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:15,720
items radio station things uh different

1456
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,240
distributors I've got our CD catalog uh

1457
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,880
with four different

1458
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,000
distributors uh e EPA which is epic

1459
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,720
portrait Associated labels which was CBS

1460
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,559
that they were our first distributor

1461
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,040
with Scotty Brothers then they went to I

1462
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,920
think they went to BMG okay reissued all

1463
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,240
the CDs on BMG by this point uh I

1464
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,799
think I think there were no more LPS so

1465
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,440
all the LPS up to that point were were

1466
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:42,040
epic MH uh after that there might have

1467
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,720
been a couple of BMG but then it was

1468
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,200
strictly CD then they got distribution

1469
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:50,920
with Warners WEA so everything was

1470
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,000
reissued under weah MH um wow and I

1471
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,599
would go out and seek different versions

1472
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,440
they had different catalog numbers the

1473
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:59,000
early CDs had full artwork the later

1474
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,359
ones didn't yeah uh for various reasons

1475
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,680
interesting um the uh you know they

1476
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:07,119
repressed not repressed but repressed

1477
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,040
the the CD so the CD catalog numbers of

1478
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,480
course and the the label art was

1479
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,240
sometimes a little bit different so

1480
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,280
those all are in the in the archive as

1481
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,960
well yeah uh when Sony took over

1482
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,079
reissued all the CD had to go get them

1483
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,599
all again oh my gosh uh you know I've

1484
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,319
got them in uh under Scotty Brothers I

1485
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:24,920
got them in their original long boxes

1486
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,640
mhm and they're all shrink wrapped wow

1487
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,920
so they're brand new some of them may be

1488
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,760
promo items mhm but they're all brand

1489
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,079
new does the internet once told me and

1490
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,799
it could be it's the internet so it

1491
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,200
could be mistaken that there that off

1492
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,200
the deep end was released on vinyl

1493
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,119
somewhere in

1494
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,640
Europe

1495
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:44,359
uh I haven't been able to find it or

1496
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,680
enough information to find out so I use

1497
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:48,480
that as an excuse to talk about it on

1498
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,760
the podcast but I don't know okay it it

1499
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,480
was it was released on vinyl probably as

1500
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,880
a bootleg I think either from Korea or

1501
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,680
the Philippines okay okay there was

1502
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,480
there was it smells like Nirvana was

1503
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:04,400
released as a 12in MH with with the off

1504
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,920
the deep end artwork okay okay uh in uh

1505
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,480
Britain okay interesting I I believe I

1506
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,799
didn't know maybe German H I don't know

1507
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,559
but that that was like a 12in single

1508
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:16,760
novel you know not novelty but a a niche

1509
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,119
sure kind of thing but yeah CDs had

1510
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,760
certainly taken over by that point I

1511
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:23,960
remember remarking to Al in ' 89 when we

1512
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,359
were wrapping up UHF I said this is and

1513
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,200
and everything was coming out still on

1514
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,680
cassette mind you so cassette cdlp I

1515
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,680
said you know this is probably going to

1516
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:37,319
be our last vinyl album yeah and you

1517
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:41,920
know officially issued by our label and

1518
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:43,640
uh and I was right MH as it turns out uh

1519
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,720
so for off the deep end it was just CD

1520
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:49,839
and cassette I I if there was a European

1521
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,200
album on vinyl I'll have it in my

1522
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,119
archive I don't off the top of my head I

1523
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,720
don't doubt it uh and I don't have the

1524
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,400
and the archive is not available online

1525
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,799
I can't I can't look at it right the

1526
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,920
discography is but it's a US discography

1527
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:05,119
because everything outside of the US

1528
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:09,280
even Canada is is very hard to pin down

1529
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:11,160
and if and if I can't be 99% complete I

1530
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,280
don't want to do it at all understand I

1531
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,720
don't want to be I don't want to have

1532
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,960
anything not be accounted for if it's in

1533
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,760
the

1534
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,960
US well all of Al's albums and product

1535
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,880
and reissues and all that are all

1536
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,200
accounted for mhm there might be a promo

1537
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,079
thing here that I'm not aware of you

1538
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,440
know stuff like that course but Europe

1539
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:32,960
and and uh Asia and Australia and South

1540
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,839
America and are just are very hard to

1541
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,240
pin down I would I would I would imagine

1542
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:39,319
and and Canada as well and and so I

1543
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,559
don't I kind of don't even try in terms

1544
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:43,920
of the discography so I call it a US

1545
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:47,359
discography makes sense and and that's

1546
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,359
relied on as the official discography do

1547
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:52,240
you you know what I should ask you um

1548
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:53,880
because this has been fascinating but i'

1549
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,599
I haven't asked you do you have a

1550
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,400
favorite original that you guys play is

1551
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,680
there like one that either is super fun

1552
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,079
to play Super Fun to listen to I'm

1553
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,319
curious because I have some weird deep

1554
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,480
cuts that I don't know if anybody else

1555
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:07,240
cares about but I'm curious like what's

1556
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,599
well the deep cut you're going to hear

1557
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,359
deep cuts at this next I can't wait

1558
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,359
that's just you're going to hear stuff

1559
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,240
that that none of us want to play but

1560
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,839
just it's just to like bring it out and

1561
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,559
and you know for the fans who would

1562
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:20,240
never otherwise of course you know stuff

1563
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,680
we've never played live and and

1564
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,520
sometimes for good reason I I don't know

1565
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,960
you know that's that's the very most

1566
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,440
difficult question I have is you know

1567
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,440
what what's your favorite song what's

1568
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,480
your favorite original what's your

1569
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,240
favorite what's your favorite album and

1570
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,680
I just you know it's it's usually album

1571
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,000
wise now it's usually the most current

1572
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,200
album because one it's fresh course two

1573
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,520
we've you know with each album we we

1574
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,559
grow we grow as players we grow as

1575
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:47,640
programmers our listening abilities grow

1576
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:51,160
uh our our technal technical abilities

1577
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:53,200
grow and so every album is for for

1578
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:57,559
various reasons better than the last I

1579
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:59,880
think Al's humor gets gets better it's

1580
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:02,319
not as goofy silly you know food related

1581
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,880
as it once was sure it's

1582
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:07,400
very it's it's

1583
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:11,160
uh it's I don't want to say it's more

1584
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:13,119
adult right it's just it's more honed

1585
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,039
it's it's it doesn't rely on being goofy

1586
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,599
and W there's still a little bit of that

1587
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,079
but it's not all about just being goofy

1588
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:21,319
and outrageous he's got some very

1589
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,720
incisive absolutely you know commentary

1590
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:24,359
I mean there's some social commentary

1591
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,480
going on that's why trigger happy always

1592
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:28,440
stands out to me so much I love that and

1593
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,319
whether whether he believes it or not

1594
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,720
whether he's sending a message or not

1595
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,480
and sometimes he does and sometimes he

1596
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,119
doesn't uh it's just he knows that it's

1597
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,920
something that will raise somebody's

1598
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,000
awareness and get them to think yeah you

1599
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,480
know while while you know that's not

1600
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,319
always the goal it's he's not writing

1601
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,039
stuff to get people to think but it's

1602
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:46,640
it's while he's at it you know it's like

1603
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,760
well I can be funny and and maybe get

1604
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,520
someone to stop and think about

1605
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,920
something you know this is important or

1606
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,880
or some people think this is important

1607
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,079
maybe you know my my listeners should be

1608
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,839
aware of this of course you know but not

1609
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,200
something he wouldn't ever put you know

1610
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,599
something like that in the liner notes

1611
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,160
you know visit save the whales you of

1612
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,319
course right yeah that would defeat the

1613
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,359
purpose donate to you know eat the

1614
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:09,200
animals or whatever oh he doesn't eat

1615
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,319
animals whatever or don't eat the

1616
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,119
animals don't eatthe

1617
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:16,240
animals.com tell them Mal sent you now

1618
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:19,480
you know favorite song I you I I like

1619
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:21,440
them all MH you know there's nothing

1620
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,000
that I that I dread playing it's nothing

1621
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,799
that I fall asleep while I'm playing

1622
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,760
it's like you know it's nothing like God

1623
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,280
why do we have to play this song

1624
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,640
uh because in the case of The Originals

1625
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,920
those are all my parts so I mean it

1626
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,480
would be sort of hypocritical for me to

1627
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,920
say I don't like the song When I'm doing

1628
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,720
what I did on it you know I I get to to

1629
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,160
replay the parts that that are the parts

1630
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,599
you know that are things that I made up

1631
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,960
or that Al told me that I should be

1632
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:46,880
making up or whatever it was uh you know

1633
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,839
that's stuff that I'm proud of so in

1634
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,480
that respect I I like them all now

1635
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:52,720
there's some things and and come up on

1636
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,319

one every night yeah yeah uh I I'll I'll

1660

1664
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:59,520
rather lengthy songs yeah that are going

1665
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:01,000
to get played and and so we get into

1666
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,319

like them all yeah that's that's a

1672
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,039
reasonable answer I I I can't I can't

1673
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,520
ful it because I also like it's very

1674
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,520
hard it would be impossible to pick one

1675
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,319
or 10 or 50 sure uh and we have all you

1676
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,599
know 14 albums worth of songs there's a

1677
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:28,880
lot of songs and a lot songs that were

1678
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:32,960
never recorded that we've played I know

1679
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,520
I know gosh originals and and parodies

1680
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,680
you know I can't wait for this I got

1681
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,400
chills when you mentioned the whole

1682
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,520
format I'm like oh goodness you've just

1683
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,960
designed a concert for me that's so

1684
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,480
amazing well that's that's was Al's

1685
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,839
thinking it's like you know this is this

1686
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,480
is just for the fans it's not for the

1687
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:47,319
people who's like wow Al got a number

1688
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,839
one album he must be really special

1689
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:50,039
we'll buy it we wouldn't normally but

1690
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:52,319
we'll buy you know he's hung in there

1691
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:54,640
for 30 plus years we better see his show

1692
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,480
before you know one of us dies right

1693
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,039
right and uh

1694
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,480
and that's and and that's not a bad

1695
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:01,440
thing you know it's like when you're

1696
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,480
when you're popular it's like people

1697
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,119
gravitate yeah but the the fans have

1698
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,520
always been there and we've got new

1699
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,640
Young fans yeah uh and a lot of them

1700
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,359
will be at these shows and we've got

1701
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:14,200
fans that have been with us 20 25 30

1702
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,599
yeah years longer I love seeing multigen

1703
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,480
external fan like groups that come oh to

1704
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:20,240
the shows it's amazing it's an extremely

1705
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,079
wide demographic in the audience I mean

1706
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,920
there's 5-year-olds there's 65y olds

1707
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,640
well the 65y olds are on stage uh no

1708
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,079
there's there's it's a very wide demo

1709
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,720
and and unlike I don't remember exactly

1710
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,799
when it changed but in the very early

1711
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:38,640
days Al's appeal well because you know

1712
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:40,240
so closely related with Dr dento uh was

1713
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,359
was more towards kind of adolescent

1714
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,680
males sure Junior High high school maybe

1715
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:49,559
college men boys uh very few females at

1716
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,440
the time so we would go do shows and and

1717
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,799
it was rare to see girls in the audience

1718
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,359
I mean it was the crowd that liked mty

1719
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:57,880
Python and three stoes and stuff like

1720
01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:00,799
that fire sign theater of course and uh

1721
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:04,000
and Weir out well over time you know

1722
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:06,000
certainly by the by the early to mid 90s

1723
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,319
that had changed it was very much a

1724
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,799
50/50 kind of thing and I don't know if

1725
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:13,079
it was Al's appeal or if the guys had

1726
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,960
gotten were old enough to to start

1727
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:16,839
dating bring in their girlfriends that

1728
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,400
makes sense I mean I can understand why

1729
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:20,079
why some of the nerdy guys back in the

1730
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,079
day didn't have girls with them yeah

1731
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,760
yeah uh you know it was it was partly

1732
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,839
the girls didn't like it and partly they

1733
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,520
probably couldn't get any girls right

1734
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:30,279
that's that's uh changed a lot you know

1735
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,680
with all due respect to the male nerds

1736
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:33,079
out there there are plenty of female

1737
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,640
nerds too of course yeah I married to

1738
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:38,039
one she she goes to the shows with me

1739
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,480
you know that's nice um so so it uh you

1740
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:42,559
know it's it's a very and then the age

1741
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,000
range yeah uh has has expanded

1742
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,799
tremendously and it's not just the fans

1743
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,960
from 20 years ago bringing their kids

1744
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:51,240
now uh it's it's fans from 20 years ago

1745
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,440
sometimes there's you know their kids

1746
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,440
are there sometimes there's new fans

1747
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,960
that are young 5year olds 10 year olds

1748
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,760
what ever uh you know anyone really who

1749
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,359
can understand lyrics and uh you know

1750
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:05,279
has enough money to buy a ticket we love

1751
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:06,319
them they're they're what we no that's

1752
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,160
that's

1753
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:11,359
terrible uh no if their parents buy a

1754
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,000
ticket that's good no you know anyone

1755
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,440
anyone who sort of gets what we do I

1756
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,640
mean it's kind of an ageless thing

1757
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,760
anymore it's it's the adults get stuff

1758
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,599
you know if there's something a little

1759
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:24,000
bit blue and in Al's you know lyrics and

1760
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:26,760
and you know he's gotten to be kind of

1761
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,839
the master of that uh you know over the

1762
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,599
years uh you know the parents know that

1763
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,720
it's kind of above the kids' heads they

1764
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,440
don't they don't have to worry about the

1765
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,160
kids hearing that other than in 15 or 20

1766
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,720
years you know the kids will go darn

1767
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,279
that's what he meant right right and and

1768
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,680
then the parent you know Dad why didn't

1769
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:45,680
you tell me that's what was the parents

1770
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:49,079
have a different problem right but uh no

1771
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:50,839
Al Al's he's very good at at

1772
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:54,520
knowing he

1773
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:56,559
doesn't he doesn't how do I put this

1774
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,920
he's careful about his lri lyrics in

1775
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:03,119
terms of not because the kids you know

1776
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,960
don't hear these things on TV and in in

1777
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,440
other forms of music and in school and

1778
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,039
stuff like that it's not that they don't

1779
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,599
hear words and lines and stuff that you

1780
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,839
know Al wouldn't

1781
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:15,400
say he's concerned that their parents

1782
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:17,640
will hear them hearing it from Al yeah

1783
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,599
and and uh that reflects poorly on him

1784
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:24,200
of course so he's able to to sometimes

1785
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:26,839
convey a thought and couch it humorously

1786
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,799
you know typically and uh and get away

1787
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:31,599
with it and he knows that the parents

1788
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:33,440
know that the kids won't know yeah and

1789
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,760
uh you know till much later that's the

1790
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,119
art of it and I I love it um he's he's

1791
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,520
got he's very good at that and there's a

1792
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:43,359
little bit of that on on each album yeah

1793
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,640
uh okay so I again normally we sort of

1794
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,640
wrap up I say why would you talk about

1795
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,279
this album we're not talking about one

1796
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,119
album we're talking about you know a

1797
01:06:47,279 --> 01:06:51,039
career that is still going strong for

1798
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,359
several dudes all at once who all have

1799
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:55,319
the their own input um but I would like

1800
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,960
to I don't know when this will come out

1801
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:59,520
but what do you want to promote where

1802
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,559
can people find you online well I am

1803
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:09,720
online at Bermuda schwartz.com b r m u d

1804
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:13,319
s c w r TZ period c m m like in

1805
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:15,680
summer uh and uh and any other pertinent

1806
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:18,440
links are on there of course weirdal is

1807
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:21,240
weirdal.com and I had set that up many

1808
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,559
years ago uh I was his Web Master in the

1809
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,480
beginning I was his Web Master when it

1810
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:28,279
wasn't even his site yeah it was my site

1811
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,960
about my experience with him amazing and

1812
01:07:28,279 --> 01:07:34,279
it evolved into his site and I got the

1813
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,839
weird all.com domain and I spelled w d

1814
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:38,640
which is correct and then I also thought

1815
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:42,240
well everyone gets this wrong let's get

1816
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:44,520
w i e r of d l and so we've still got

1817
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,279
that so you cannot you really have to go

1818
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,640
out of your way to spell Weird Al wrong

1819
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:50,200
to not get to the site right so you

1820
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,640
could you could spell it either way and

1821
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,720
we've got uh some fans whove become

1822
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,400
friends of ours over the years and they

1823
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,559
went out and sought weird al.net weird

1824
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:02,559
al.org wow and they have those forward

1825
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,400
that's great and and uh but basically

1826
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:08,359
weirdal.com uh is where everything Al is

1827
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:12,240
uh we we converted that to a WordPress

1828
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:15,000
site uh two years ago okay and uh Al can

1829
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:17,040
maintain that yeah if I go in to do some

1830
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,719
work on it WordPress is too easy I have

1831
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,199
to go in look at all the code y yep and

1832
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:22,560
and I can manipulate the code if I'm

1833
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,640
looking at WordPress I mean I know it's

1834
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,960
supposed to be drag and drop and you

1835
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,239
know and it's just

1836
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,000
I I can't I can't do it right I have to

1837
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:32,600
go in and put tags and do all which I

1838
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,719
know you know that's how I learn I still

1839
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,759
code sure I'm I'm the kids call me a

1840
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,199
coder or a codger I forget it's just one

1841
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,199
letter whatever one letter up that's

1842
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,000
fine uh but yeah I still I still do

1843
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:46,640
websites for other clients you know uh

1844
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,279
not as feverishly as I used to Sure uh I

1845
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,920
mean you know all all the WordPress and

1846
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,679
and the the Wicks and places like that

1847
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,560
that you can just have they have all

1848
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,799
sorts of drag and drop ready to go Stu

1849
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,199
you really don't have to know how to do

1850
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,040
that stuff anymore and frankly I just

1851
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:01,440
haven't kept up with it yeah so I'm not

1852
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,440
taking on any new clients at this

1853
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:09,199
timeart but but uh the Weird Al

1854
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:12,560
I the site was so deep I had so many

1855
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:14,920
pages and so much information that when

1856
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,319
Sony agreed to host the site as they did

1857
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,880
for almost all of their artists because

1858
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,000
they controlled a lot of the promotion

1859
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,279
within the those artists site they

1860
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,880
hosted it they granted me access to

1861
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,080
their servers wow

1862
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,560
uh only so much access because I did try

1863
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,000
to go up a level to get into their I

1864
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,679
couldn't do it I I just wanted to see if

1865
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,040
I could get in there they they knew I

1866
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:39,319
would do that so I I couldn't but they

1867
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,520
let me into their server and they hosted

1868
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:42,600
and when they first got the site they

1869
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,120
said we have never seen such a deep site

1870
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,440
yeah I said well I started this site

1871
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:50,560
before anybody had websites yeah yeah

1872
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:52,480
you know I did this site in 1995 mhm and

1873
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,040
uh so they were they were extremely

1874
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,840
impressed and the site is still pretty

1875
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,000
deep that's great yeah photo galleries

1876
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,159
have made their way over to Instagram

1877
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:05,400
and Twitter these days which Al controls

1878
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:07,600
he feeds that Facebook to an extent so

1879
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,480
the site is a little bit static uh it's

1880
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,719
used just sort of as a a resource all

1881
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,440
the tour dates are on there set lists

1882
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:16,159

discography I don't know why it would

1890
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,600
have been simple enough to put on

1891
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,600
weirdal.com but he said I'll just I'll

1892

that updated and we're uh I I'm working

1896
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,520
on one that resembles the current

1897
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:50,239
weirdal.com format the the kind of gray

1898
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,600
the little more AER uh format of that

1899
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:54,040
and I just

1900
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,480
haven't it's it's not completely up to

1901
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,760
date there's just so many little things

1902
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,159
thanks to Jeff Morris yeah pointing out

1903
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,560
well you know this thing came out didn't

1904
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:02,239
come out before this and you've got it

1905
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,320
on the list here and there was this

1906
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,520
other thing that came out here well

1907
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,199
you've got you know UHF you know came

1908
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,360
out on Blu-ray in this year but you put

1909
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:13,520
Blu-ray up you know in the other thing

1910
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,320
you know up in 1989 where but that

1911
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,280
couldn't have possibly been so he

1912
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,080
catches me on a lot of stuff and I've

1913
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,400
got a long list of things that I have to

1914
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,600
decide how to do it so that it meets

1915
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:26,320
with his standards which are probably

1916
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,199
higher than mine so I'm trying to please

1917
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,239
Jeff on on of you know he's more

1918
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:32,440
meticulous than I am but you know what

1919
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,520
that's that's good of course he keeps me

1920
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,520
in line uh when did Squeezebox come out

1921
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:38,280
again Squeezebox uh Street date on that

1922
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:42,239
is November 24th November 24th at the

1923
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:45,760
end of 2017 2017 and uh that's out on in

1924
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:48,360
both LP and uh CD and the way that's

1925
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,120
being accomplished is uh if if anyone

1926
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,760
hasn't been to the site that was

1927
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,400
promoting like the the pre-sales on

1928
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,760
those the way that works is they're not

1929
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,159
doing like a little tiny accordion for

1930
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,520
the CDs yeah they're doing one size and

1931
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:03,199
it's going to be a big Square Accord

1932
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,840
because it has to obviously fit LPS yeah

1933
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:08,320
they are making special jackets uh in

1934
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,080
the size of the LPS really with a little

1935

1950
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:44,639
Outlets I've had for the photos in the

like that but they they've got the

1977
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:50,320

course I've got all the negatives sure

1991
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,800
if I ever I could do my own book of

1992
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,520
stuff none of which is in the Sony book

1993
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:23,920
yeah yeah mind you or or Nathan's book

01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:25,199
yeah oh or as I like to call it my book

1995
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:29,400
or as Al likes to call it the weird

1996
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:31,199
albook uhhuh no I I curated probably 95%

1997
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,480
of the photos in that book and that's

1998
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:36,000
great easily 99% of the photos in the in

1999
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:38,040
the book that's coming with the box set

2000
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,679
that's so good so I'm I'm I'm really I'm

2001
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,480
very happy to be involved uh to a much

2002
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:44,800
larger extent than most musicians are

2003
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,360
involved with their label MH which it's

2004
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,520
actually not even our label anymore

2005
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:52,679
right right that's the AL very very uh

2006
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:55,800
publicly uh decided to not resign sure

2007
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:57,280
with Sony or anyone else yeah uh after

2008
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,199
having a number one album number one

2009
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,400
cool goodbye right actually that was

2010
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:04,080
that you know what the departure was in

2011
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,719
the works and and you know with the

2012
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:10,239
number one album I think both Sony and

2013
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:12,639
Al thought hm maybe I know Sony did Sony

2014
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:14,600
certainly wanted to to uh continue the

2015
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:17,239
relationship of course of course and Al

2016
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:20,120
was ready to essentially go independent

2017
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:22,440
yeah um and uh which is not a bad thing

2018
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,080
sure no no I think being independent is

2019
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,719
is great if you're at a point where you

2020
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,880
can be independent I think if you're

2021
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:30,440
independent because you're just starting

2022
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,520
it's still a very uh tough road to Ho as

2023
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:34,480
they say yeah uh it's a very tough climb

2024
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,520
to uh what do you do do you get hooked

2025
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,520
up with a label to not sell any albums

2026
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,880
right uh you know it's it's not it's you

2027
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,120
know and and if you don't sell albums

2028
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,159
and you can't get the right promotion

2029
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:46,600
can you go on tour and and get anybody

2030
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:49,000
to come see you can you make money that

2031
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,520
way right it's it's very difficult you

2032
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,840
know YouTube is great exposure but it's

2033
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,719
how do you draw people to come see you

2034
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,120
there of course and it's free but it's

2035
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:56,960
like well how how do you get people to

2036
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,520
go see you and then will they come see

2037
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,239
you live and and pay five or 10 or 20

2038
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,560
bucks to come see you right you know can

2039
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:05,159
you do a college tour can you do and and

2040
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,920
it's tough with Allen and a lot of other

2041
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:09,800
artists that have left their labels uh

2042
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,000
they're in a position they're at a place

2043
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:15,080
where they can continue doing what they

2044
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,360
do yeah and the labels have been great

2045
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,760
but there's not actually a need he

2046
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,639
doesn't resent it it's just I don't have

2047
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:23,159
to have a label yeah they're not going

2048
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:24,920
to sell any more records than I can and

2049
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:26,239
they don't book our tours you know every

2050
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,000
everything the whole rest of my career

2051
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:32,120
is separate from the label if I'm not

2052
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,920
selling records you know why why bother

2053
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,960
yeah well I'm I'm very excited for the

2054
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:40,040
future I am I cannot wait to go see you

2059
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,280
could do that all day um but well I

2060
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:49,880
don't know that I still remember the

2061
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:52,800
tale of the giant R of

2062
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:56,360
Sumatra uh but I I swear to God I knew

2063
01:16:52,800 --> 01:17:00,639
all the all the lines was blind I I tell

2064
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:02,480
you I I was so hooked on uh on stuff

2065
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:05,000
from that album and stuff from a lot of

2066
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:08,280
I'm my python I was a huge fan sure uh I

2067
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:12,600
and I would I I actually had I had the

2068
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:14,440
phone company list my name as Jim blind

2069
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:17,440
uhhuh so that in the phone book it would

2070
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:20,800
read blind Jim which was the

2071
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:24,320
dog which was oh my God uh Hemlock

2072
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:27,440
Stone's dog in in the in the show that's

2073
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,920
amazing in the album blind gem fantastic

2074
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,320
and I'll tell you how many how many uh

2075
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,639
you know the society for the blind how

2076
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,920
many people saw that and thought that

2077
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:36,760
was a reference to my being blind would

2078
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,320
call that number but I just thought that

2079
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,679
was so cool I hope for the S sake of

2080
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,080
your archiving that you still have a

2081
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:45,280
copy of that phone book you know I don't

2082
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:49,239
well it never occurred what year was

2083
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:51,840
this uh somebody's got one

2084
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:53,920
789 there's a hoarder out there who has

2085
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,120
every phone book I lived in Glendale so

2086
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,120
if there was a Glen

2087
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:01,159
or a valley phone book or a downtown

2088
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,280
area phone book it's so funny so 78 7980

2089
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:04,320
would have been the year and and it's of

2090
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,719
course the phone number is no good so

2091
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,000
feel free to call it uh I don't I don't

2092
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,920
quite I don't remember the phone number

2093
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,560
I have it written down somewhere but it

2094
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,679
was that apartment and there's there's a

2095
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:17,320
couple of iconic photos when the placebo

2096
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:19,760
EP uh was pressed up Al got them in

2097
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:22,000
plain white sleeves he had also printed

2098
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,480
up what became the the front and back

2099
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,520
cover which was just an elongated I

2100
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:31,400
guess 7x14 sheet that he folded and then

2101
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,960
he had like 7in uh they weren't myar

2102
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:36,080
sleeves but they were plastic sleeves

2103
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:39,480
yeah uh and so we had like a a placebo

2104
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:42,560
EP assembly party at my apartment which

2105
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,639
was me Dr Neo and Al and so there's

2106
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,840
pictures anytime you see a picture with

2107
01:18:44,639 --> 01:18:49,719
Al holding up the placebo EP or Demento

01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,600
holding up one of the discs or whatever

01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:53,639
and there's this horrible orange

2110
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,840
wallpaper in the back that's my

2111
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:57,639
apartment in Glendale

2112
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,520
uh which is which is where I was living

2113
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:01,960
when I met Al yeah I have I have other

2114
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,400
pictures of it's where we recorded the

2115
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:08,000
Dr Demento jingle really that went uh it

2116
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,159
was just

2117
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,960
drums drums and and like Temple blocks

2118
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:15,400
MH and it was uh I didn't sing on it and

2119
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:17,080
you and you'll know why in a second but

2120
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,760
it was the one you hear it on the Dr

2121
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:22,960
dementa show still and it was Dr Demento

2122
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:25,199
Dr Demento Dr Demento and there's like

2123
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:28,120
this laughing at the end which he and

2124
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:31,159
and we left it in and actually I think

2125
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:33,400
we I think we brought it in from the end

2126
01:19:31,159 --> 01:19:36,120
of another song we had done M and we

2127
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,239
just like taped it you know edited into

2128
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:40,679
the end of that it's great that is also

2129
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,360
on medium Rarities that's F and I Remix

2130
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:44,520
that I have the original tracks on that

2131
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:46,600
in digital and and everything's

2132
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:49,040
separated and I I remixed a version you

2133
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,360
know under Al's supervision and it's

2134
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,239
cleaner than it ever could have been

2135
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,440
that's amazing because the copy Dr dedo

2136
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:58,960
got was at least a second generation

2137
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:02,760
cassette sure of a cassette right so it

2138
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:05,719
it was only so clean yeah this is the

2139
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,679
original pora Studio cassette so it's as

2140
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:08,960
clean as that it's it's that it's like

2141
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,679
listening to that

2142
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:14,960
cassette uh it's it's I'd never heard it

2143
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:16,360
so good that's amazing and uh so of

2144
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,560
course I won't get credit for remixing

2145
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:22,920
that of course uh I think uh I think

2146
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:25,239
Pac-Man came from me mhm um which is

2147
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,400
fantastic uh and that might have been a

2148
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:29,960
little bit of a remix I had the Pac-Man

2149
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:32,199
music and I had the Pac-Man vocals and I

2150
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:34,960
think I I comped that all from the the

2151
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:37,440
Masters mhm and I think that's my mix as

2152
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,120
well wow so that is also cleaner than

2153
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,760
anyone would have ever heard it well

2154
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,639
