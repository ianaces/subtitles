00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,360
to be a comedian I don't know I mean i'

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,480
ra rather be a you know an a band more

211
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,640
[ __ ] but um comedians kind of get the

212
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
drgs but it's better than poetry uh

213
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,560
it like if if if comedy was

214
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,440
skateboarding poetry would be

215
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,240
rollerblading right like you might be

216
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,880
talented but no one wants to watch and

217
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,040
no one wants to [ __ ] you that's for sure

218
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,079
like they you might want to they might

219
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,040
you might get a girl to make love to but

220
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,040
that's gayer than [ __ ] a dude

221
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,079
like

222
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
I I travel to exotic places like North

223
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,399
Dakota North

224
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,120
Dakota North Dakota is proof that God is

225
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,000
not exactly everywhere

226
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,560
um there's you can't you can tell I'm

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,720
not from North Dakota when I go there I

228
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,959
got this look in my face it's like a

229
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,000
hope you can't look like this and be

230
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,000
from North Dakota like it's like

231
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,160
a that's what it's

232
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,519
like it's not a tolerant Place either I

233
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,480
was in a bathroom in North Dakota

234
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,600
someone carved swastikas into the wall

235
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,600
carved them they carved kill [ __ ]

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,399
someone busted in the bathroom I jumped

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,880
put my scratching tools

238
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,720

239
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,399
scratching out kill and writing

240
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,240
tolerate but I didn't want anyone to

241
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,320
know you don't want to get caught

242
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,320
tolerant in North

243
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,519
Dakota I go to Wisconsin a lot too

244
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Wisconsin is proof that you can get

245
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:05,040
pregnant from sex I truly believe

246
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,200
that

247
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,160
you and it's a spillover but it's the

248
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,519

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,880
religion that advertises you know like I

297
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,199
saw I saw on a bus bench it was like Hey

your parents go to

301
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,680

407
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,320

in a fight with two Mormons but there's

414
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:15,240
a lot of problems with fighting a guy in

415
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,240
a helmet in public

416
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,200

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,320
Mormon what was I going to do to him

419
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,039

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,640
on the curb and nothing's

422
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:37,280

423
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,200
him you know something I don't know plus

424
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm a

425
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
pacifist

426
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,919

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,320
just ended up telling each other like

657
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,840
exactly how we feel about each other

658
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,240
remembering to say the stuff all you

659
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,679
always forget to say you know

660
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,440
remembering not to take each other for

661
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,559
granted see it's this drug that was

662
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,640
legal up until the 80s that they Ed for

663
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,240
like uh couples counseling marriage

664
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,320
counseling they also use it for regress

665
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,720
memories cuz what it does is it it it it

666
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,000
really helps you have like an step back

667
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,799
from all your petty problems just kind

668
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,200
of fall away and you just like feel this

669
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,120
unconditional love for yourself and the

670
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,600
people you care about so it sucks don't

671
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,679
do it and uh so what and and then and

672
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,279
it's not like tripping because you have

673
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,720
like a control over it and um basically

674
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,880
you uh like what it did for me recently

675
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,320
is um you know it made me realize that I

676
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,760

1220
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,960
