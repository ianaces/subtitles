cushion I actually think that's the

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,640
perfect screening procedure I think you

350
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,799

351
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,960

I think if you have an American passport

363
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,559
and an above room temperature IQ I think

364
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,679
the airline should give you a gun as

365
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,159

366
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,520

367
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,799

want any chickens coming back at me

553
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,760

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,120
omelette I mean it's not right know

555
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,000

556
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,000
hamburger and dipping it into your

557
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,919
milk well that's what I'm saying you

558
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,600
don't do it it's not

559
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,559
Kosher literally it's not Kosher people

560
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,679
you have to separate some food items

561
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,159
that's all I'm saying that's why we have

562
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:32,240
problems with the e like spinach he call

563
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,880
like peanut butter mad cow disease you

564
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,840
know where that come from some idiot fed

565
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,039
cows to the other

566
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,120

567
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,440
man I would be

568
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,760
furious you know I like chicken I just

569
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,399
don't like it in eggs I like food that

570
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,960
moves that's what I'm

571
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:55,840
saying you know God made animals slow

572
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,279
enough to catch he obviously intended

573
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,080
for us to eat them

574
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:05,159
besides that what's the fun in hunting a

575
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,600
vegetable anybody could sneak up on a

576
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:09,520
carrot and I don't even trust vegetables

577
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,200
because they get the nutrients from the

578
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:16,200
dirt would you eat dirt no then why eat

579
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,320
the

580
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,919
middleman and some of that shit's not

581
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,559
even food celery that's not food that's

582
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,399
Dental flaws trapped inside a

583
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,679

gentlemen celer is dangerous it's a Nega

585

of calorie food there's four calories

586
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,679
and one stick of celery but if you eat

587
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,440
it it takes your body six calories to

588
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,440
process it you could kill yourself

589
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,440
eating

590
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,360
celery if that's all you ate you're

591
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,840
operating a calorie deficit and the more

592
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,399

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,799

00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:48,840

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,440

618
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:56,240

619
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,519
spoil it's not like salt but I was out

620
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,120
having dinner and it's poor old guy God

621
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,519
bless him he had the worst case of

622
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,360
carpal tunnel syndrome I've ever seen in

623
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,640
my life he couldn't get any traction on

624
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,960
top of the wheel for like five minutes

625
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,320
finally he puts the pepper bazooka up on

626
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,880
his shoulder while a team of bus boys

627
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,640
came running over and worked it from the

628
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,640
back end which I thought ruined the

629
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,240
presentation but that's why you pay the

630
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,120
money to go out to eat because the way

631
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,760
they present it to you you know even the

632
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,720
way they word stuff in restaurants it's

633
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,080
different than you know like d they say

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,519

life and take care of it and support it

649
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:10,840
seafood restaurant one night and they

650
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,720
had the audacity to put a giant fish

651
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:17,080
aquarium as the center piece for the

652
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,080
entire seafood

653
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:22,720
restaurant why would you do

654
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:26,240
that I don't need to eat fish while I'm

655
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,720
looking at fish it made me

656
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,000
uncomfortable and I'm sure the fish

657
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,360
weren't [ __ ] crazy about it

658
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,399
either and they got nothing to do all

659
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,360
day except swim around and watch the

660
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,519
waiters walk by with the different ways

661
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,360
that they can be

662
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:45,039
prepared oh you talk about

little fish

665
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,399

666
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,480

it all don't you even care

686
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,320
yeah well I'm just saying where the

687
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,559
animal rights people on something like

688
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,720
that I guess if you don't have fur

689
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,840
you're out of

690
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,880
luck no because that's all they care

691
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,320
about don't wear fur don't wear fur they

692
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,480
don't care when you wear leather really

693
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,639
just

694
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,159
F I'm guessing that's cuz it's much

695
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:24,320
easier to harass a woman than it is a

696
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,840
biker that would be my guess otherwise

697
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
why don't you run down to the biker bar

698
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,159
and throw red paint on warlocks

699
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,440

700
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,159

male Eagle's flying and the female eagle

765
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,480
does his little Top Gun move where she

766
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,800

00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,400
vagina

942
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,040

946
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,480
smell nice so the vagina will talk to us

947
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,960
that's why we work so we have money to

948
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,559
spend in the vagina that's why Thomas

949
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,280

950
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,920

00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:25,119
could be in a struggle with somebody and

993
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,480
like a pubic care could dislodge and

994
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,760
fall down your pants like you don't even

995
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,240

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,400
some duct tape pick up that whole area

997
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,559
isolate that pubic care and track it

998
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,520
right back to your genit

999
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,200
talian especially if there's a little

1000
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:45,200
roote on the end of it they love that

1001
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,200
down the DNA lab that's a 10-point match

1002
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,640
[ __ ] with the technology they have you

1003
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,240
could fart at the crime seat and if they

1004
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,599
got there soon enough and bagged that

1005
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,880
Rascal up and sent it down to the FBI

1006
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,559
lab and they found out the fart had a

1007
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,280
consistency of a cheeseburger a large

1008
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,839
fry and a Diet Coke from the McDonald's

1009
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,440
on the corner of Maine and four street

1010
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,920
because of something to use in the fry

1011
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,680
later it's indigenous to that McDonald's

1012
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,319
and traces of that showed up in the fart

1013
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,920
and it went in there before the day day

1014
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,119
before the murder and viewed the tape

1015
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,720
and there's your dumbass eating the

1016
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,960
cheeseburger with a Happy Meal around

1017
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,640
you and your flies down the pubic hairs

1018
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:28,359
hanging out they got

1019
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,359
you they could tie you to the crime

1020
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,800
scene and then you go into jail where

1021
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,280
your [ __ ] and your baseball hat are

1022
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,359

1024
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:46,160

stop micromanaging your kids' Liv so

1099
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,839

it's a class a narcotic it's a very

1227
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,400
powerful toxin it's part of the frog's

1228
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,440
defense mechanism like if another animal

1229
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,960
triy to eat the Frog the frogs increase

1230
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,520
the substance that when when the animal

1231
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,040
grabs it its mouth and starts tripping

1232
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,559

1233
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,640
