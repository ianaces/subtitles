entertaining and informational

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,960
uh so I'm just going to have to do a

19
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,240
quick little test of the audience off

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,240
the top uh little just just just to see

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,920
what your capabilities are as a group

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
you haven't worked together as a group

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
before have

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,560
you so you'll be finding out a lot about

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,920
yourself with this test

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,920
also what I'll do is I'm going to tell

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,840
two jokes of varying degrees of

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,119
difficulty to

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,079
understand

30
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,880
and at the end of those two jokes I will

31
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:40,960
put both reactions into the comedy

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,640
machine at that point I will decide

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,640
whether or not I can leave the big words

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,840
in I will now begin with what I like to

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159

swearing bothers me just that I don't

86
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,840
understand current swearing because when

87
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,239
you swear you're trying to be

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,880
offensive but the things that swearing

89
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,880

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,440

91
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,560

[ __ ] although I don't eat

95
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,770

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,850

102
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
swears are going to have to become

103
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,440
longer to make them something something

104
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,080

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,720
possibility I can get into Jewish

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,000

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,120
out oh cuz my granny was from Estonia

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,599
and before World War II she lived in

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
Estonia cuz that's the way it worked

133
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,720
before the war where you were from

134
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,720
that's where you got to

135
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,199
live then then Hitler and sty had a

136
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,000
really big fight in her backyard and she

137
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,880
had to [ __ ]

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,880
up but she stuck it out for a while she

139
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,560
stuck it out for a while and uh in in

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,319
Estonia trying to just make her life

141
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,319
there and in that time she hid Jews in

142
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,919
her basement during the war which by the

143
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,520
way is the only time that kind of

144
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,520
behavior is

145
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,110
[Laughter]

146
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,840
acceptable

147
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,840
got to be a war

148
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,960
on and if it ends let them

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,280
go if they come back they're

150
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,919
yours but if they don't they never

151
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,160
were I think I'm in

152
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,440
man but the whole concept of heaven and

153
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,800
hell is a little weird you know like uh

154
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,960
the old Pope when asked about heaven and

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,080
hell not the new pope not the guy who

156
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,080
used to play Cliff from

157
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,120
cheers oh I was so excited when I heard

158
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,479
Cardinal ratzenberger was going to be

159
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,360
the new pope I thought is he going to

160
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,919
play it like Cliff or come up with a new

161
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,080
wacky character or just play it as

162
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,840
himself but in the end it turned out to

163
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,319
be just a Nazi

164
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,240
oh where's the funny

165
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,479
there

166
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,000
no the old Pope when asked about hell he

167
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,720
said hell is not a place hell is a

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,440
metaphor state of mind if you will and I

169
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,400
thought that was really cool coming from

170
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,400
the head of one of the world's largest

171
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,879
corporations don't get on me for that

172
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,280
even if you're Catholic you can't get

173
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,280
offended by that joke you you know the

174
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Catholic church has too much money you

175
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,879
know your religion has too much money

176
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,080
money if out of nowhere the Swiss show

177
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,080
up and guard your

178
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,920
leader show up like big red

179
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,240
conquistadors for some reason

180
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,399
hello what are you guys doing here we

181
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,279
keep an eye on

182
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,000
him

183
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,399
why bad things happen if bad things

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,200
happen to

185
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,200
him put him in a bubble

186
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,680
hell is not a place it's a state of mind

187
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
I thought that was a totally cool thing

188
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,079
to say until you find out more about why

189
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,600
he actually said it apparently he only

190
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,600
said it cuz he was trying to use it and

191
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,360
Scrabble where you can't use a

192
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,040

people don't worry if you're religious

196
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,720
this whole show is not going to be just

197
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,120
making fun of religion just the last 10

198
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,399
minutes um no I actually I think that

199
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,360
the religious have been getting a bit of

200
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,000
a rough ride lately honestly like that

201
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,360
whole thing that came up like whether or

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
not to rename Christmas winter

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,240

209
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,279

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,920

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,560
that's a religious Festival like I'm not

Christian well I was born and then told

214
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,360

215
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,519
it and I wouldn't have done if I was a

216
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,360

217
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:31,040

239
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,800
uncomfortable Hinduism is a lovely

240
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,600
religion you don't have to freak out and

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,480
have a riot if somebody writes an

242
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,360
offensive cartoon towards your God you

243
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160

East we'll never do it

249
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,279
again you can't cuz the two sacred

250
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,800
animals are the cow and the Elephant you

251
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,440
can't have a ride every time somebody

252
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,399
puts one of those in a cartoon you'd

253
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,880
have to burn down Mumbai every time

254
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,800
someone released a Babar

255
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,680
annual The Far Side those would be worse

256
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,279
cuz those are actually

257
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,040
funny like a Hindu gentleman reading The

258
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,639
Far Side going yes I understand the

259
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,880
inherent

260
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,639
humor how would a cow learn how to drive

261
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,199
a tractor yes I know it's very funny

262
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,760
it's bloody

263
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,760
offensive that's my

264
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:01,240
God ah and I don't mind making jokes

265
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,360
that have Hindu people in them cuz I

266
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,120
know they're really cool about their

267
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,959
religion is like I'm from Canada but I

268
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,360
live here in London it's a long story

269
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,360
actually it's not one time I moved to

270
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,320
London that's a really short story isn't

271
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,639
it I should put some ninjas in

272
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,440
it bulk it

273
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:27,040
up yeah I was trying to get into London

274
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,639
right but at the city walls all these

275
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,959
ninjas were stopping me

276
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,839
yeah I I would step left and the ninja

277
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,959
would step right because in the story

278
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,000
that's how it would work if you're

279
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,720
facing a ninja if you step left and he

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,079
step left you go right

281
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,519
by know they were all there stopping me

282
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:49,920
so I in the end I took the tube

283
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,040
in you can't fight a train Dark

284
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,000
Assassin could

285
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,720
not but it was on that it was on that

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,160
tube Journey that I found out Hindu

287
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,240
people are really cool about their

288
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,759
religion because because there has been

289
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,600
an advertisement on the tube for 3 years

290
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,160
and I've never seen anyone Arc up I've

291
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,519
never seen anyone get upset in any way

292
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,920
and that advertisement is for elephant

293
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,959
car

294
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,120
insurance and there's folks animal which

295
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,959
gives you an idea of who this insurance

296
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,839
is angle towards someone riding the tube

297
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,079
going I wonder what the big elephant

298
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,079
thinks I should do about

299
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,680
caring he seems like such a wise

300
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,680
elephant

301
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,000
the Admiral and the parrot has many good

302
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,000
things to

303
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,240
say I think go stick with a trusty

304
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:50,880
elepant there spokes animal is an

305
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:54,360
elephant dressed up like a beef

306
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,680
eater can you think of a more offensive

307
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,600
image to a Hindu

308
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,839
person

309
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,440
then an elephant that apparently only

310
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,440
eats

311
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:14,920
cows it's still nothing man cool oh

312
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,920
trouble I put you on the ground the

313
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,800
water

314
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,959
bottle but back to my original point you

315
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,199
can't change the name of Christmas

316
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,560
that's a religious Festival then you get

317
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,680
the people on the other side of the coin

318
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,720
going oh no you have to change the name

319
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,120
name of Christmas because we are a

320
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,759
multi- religional

321
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,040
society and Christmas does not include

322
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,480
everyone all right but if you change the

323
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,319
name of Christmas to some ambiguous

324
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,199
description of what it actually is you

325
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,680
got to change the names of all the

326
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,360
religious

327
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,000
festivals

328
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,759

case and we're merely about

365
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,919
peace and

366
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,520
love for the most part those books are

367
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,320
about peace and love until you get to

368
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,760

[ __ ] the gay people should be quite

391
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,679
flattered about the religious' beliefs

392
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,360
of them because the religious all

393
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,400
believe that God controls everything he

394
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,240
makes everything he can fight anything

395
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
except his urge to make gay people

396
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:37,720
[Laughter]

397
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,520

[Applause]

400
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
this I can't stop

401
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:57,240
myself I just made a really big

402
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,320
one I am such a little

403
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,360
[ __ ]

404
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,960
I'm going to get some breeders to kill

405
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,520
them all that's what I'll

406
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,520
do stronger

407
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,760
than cuz I I think it's ridiculous the

408
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,600
way that the religious carry on about uh

409
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,080
gay people and it's it's true like it's

410
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,039
not just religious people it's religious

411
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,720
leaders and that's what pisses me off

412
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,039
it's like religious people go yeah yeah

413
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,840
you go say it we've all elected you you

414
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,320
go tell them how we

415
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,520
you know and it's a polarizing argument

416
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,600
too you can't be for the religious and

417
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,600
for gay people and the religious started

418
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,520
because if you think about it you'd

419
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,240
never accept it the other way around if

420
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,039
gay people showed up to schools and

421
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,880
handed out pamphlets to the children on

422
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,880

423
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,159
religious yeah here little Billy take it

463
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,360
years ago I was with some other

464
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,919
comedians in Vancouver we went for a

465
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,960
dollar a slice pizza in the West End of

466
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,080
Vancouver which is a very high gay

467
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,279
population area of Vancouver and the

468
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:57,960
nightclubs had just gotten out so it was

469
00:22:53,279 --> 00:23:00,760
full of the high Gaye and it was

470
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,559
restaurant across the street from us uh

471
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:07,520
that had a high gay clientele and I

472
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,520

00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,960
the suburbs which is never the start to

475
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,840
a good story two big shiny cars came in

476
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,840
from out of town and the children

477
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,840

478
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,679
these guys got out of the Camaros and

479
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,159
they had baseball bats and sticks and

480
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,760
they'd come to do a gay bashing but they

481
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,480
they didn't know any gay people except

482
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,480
all the other people in the car with

483
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,559

484
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,080

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,200
and then we can give them to a country

636
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,840
with a large land mass and a small

637
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,000
population like Australia

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,200
much bigger threat to their way of life

962
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,319
than we could ever be but they'll never

963
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,760
fight China for one very simple reason

964
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:02,079
and that is that China would kick

965
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,480

you try but it wouldn't work cuz one

983
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,200
plane would hit one building in Beijing

984
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:08,680

985
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,200
