how many times is your face on this

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,760
album cover let see one we this was an

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,199
album cover we didn't have any control

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,559
over really okay and it's called a naive

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,000
collage

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,600
uhhuh uh and you know cuz they didn't

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,320
know who we were sure and we didn't know

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,239
who we were were and so they made this

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,240
naive collage I REM I vaguely remember

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,280
the the uh photo session and and of

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,439
course I I distinctly remember the

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,240
clothes because we were all uh hippies

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,360
at that time and whatever that meant I

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
mean you know hippies invented them we

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,200
weren't Bongo playing you know

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,759
turtleneck black like we weren't beats

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,720
no we weren't beats we were we were

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,439
hippies but we weren't hippies we were

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,439
we were uh we were all educated and

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,159
clean Yeah clean educated young men

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,640
shoes had proper radio voices we had

36
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,960
radio voices we smoked pot you know I

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,079
mean we we embraced the the cult the new

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,280
culture the the youth culture and uh and

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
I remember part of that was the clothes

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,360
yeah you go out and you look for the

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,799
coolest clothes you could find and uh a

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,840
different clothes you know you have to

43
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,360
wear ties and coats and things so we're

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,840
all wearing our Our Kind see we have

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,320
things around her necks little things

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,280
and I and cool yellow glasses cool

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,160
yellow glasses those are good yeah yeah

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,640
I think I I think Peter Fonda turned me

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,080
on to those in fact and Austin's in

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,720
these great white pants yeah I know yes

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,760
white pants and Osman he's he's only

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,760
wears a well both Bergman and Osman are

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,080
still wearing their Square you know

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,239
glasses but uh but that's okay the minds

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,360
behind the glasses were certainly not

56
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,040
Square they

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,000
were elliptical or something oh I just I

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,360
God I was the

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,319
baby the papoose the lower left hand in

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,200
the lower left hand corner I was the

61
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:44,360
papoose so anyway naive collage and then

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,879
uh these interesting strange things on

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,239
the the other side uh but it was okay

64
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,200
and at the time that we did this correct

65
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:58,560
me if I'm I'm wrong we were managed by

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,680
uh Fitzgerald by Jimmy guio who was the

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,920
manager of Chicago

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,200
among other acts and a fellow named

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,319
Fitzgerald Larry Fitzgerald I think his

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,159
name was was our particular manager

71
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:15,120
person who of course Bergman destroyed

72
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,920
by removing his stomach or something I

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,640
mean I remember he finally just stopped

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,640
he says I can't do this because we were

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,879
four hippies we were

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,159
unmanageable you know Fireside theater

77
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:31,879
if if it ever had found someone lion

78
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,200
tamer or something who could have

79
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:38,040
managed us I think our career would have

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,080
been uh quite different uh but in any

81
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,439
event here we were surprisingly making

82
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,280
our first

83
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:50,599
record and I can tell you how I I

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
believe I became involved in this uh and

85
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll try to get it right as opposed to

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,200
the last time we talked about

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,040
it because it's interesting fewer

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,360
elephants this time please interesting

89
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,319
uh and if I repeat myself uh and you

90
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,519
want to compare it to the last time it

91
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,879
might that will be interesting too it'

92
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,360
be like a three-dimensional chess game

93
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,319
you know did he move the pawn that last

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
time over here we'll just edit out those

95
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,519
parts of your brain which are no longer

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,520
correct Taylor jessen our archist and a

97
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,680

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,120
my my first but definitely not my last

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,080
uh uh contact with conflict in this

172
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,000
business oh my God the conflict you know

173
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,240
talk about being in two places at once

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and you're not anywhere at all you if

175
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,879
you could be in two places at once

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
you could have a hell of a career in

177
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,560
this business but you always are having

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,879
to make a choice should I do this guest

179
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,360
starring part in this television show or

180
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,960
should I do this commercial which might

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,680
mean a lot and the times that that we

182
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,360
all make bad choices you have no idea y

183
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,599
but occasionally make a good choice and

oh please she she invented electric

284
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,000
clothing but that's another story

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,399
so the show closes I immediately get

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,040
cast as Brandon to Wild's understudy in

287
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,399
Evan Hunter's

288
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,279
uh comedy and I Ed the word Loosely a

289
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,519
race of hairy men which was his attempt

290
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,160
to explain that there that there was

291
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,160
going to be a youth Revolution not

292
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,839
terribly

293
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,600
successful and uh so Brandon and I who

294
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,639
had been faded to meet because I'd been

295
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,920
asked to understudy him when I was a

296
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,920
child actor and he was a child actor in

297
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,199
a play called Mrs MC thing which starred

298
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,800
Helen Hayes back in the ' 50s I guess it

299
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:34,600
was or maybe even the late 40s I don't

300
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,320
remember uh he I understudied him and we

301
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:41,839
became friends just like that and he was

302
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,120
a head he loved to smoke P so after

303
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,920
rehearsals we used to go up to a

304
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,079
dressing room at the Henry Miller

305
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,560
Theater I think it was where we were up

306
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,360
in to a dressing room in the top of the

307
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,240
uh uh theater and we turn on the air

308
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,240
conditioner and we smoke pot and get

309
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,199
stoned this is the air conditioner that

310
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,399
did not work no it wasn't that we we we

311
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,079
discovered at the end of the run that

312
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,680
the air conditioner was sitting inside

313
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,040
the window that's right the window the

314
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,320
window wasn't open so it was just

315
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:16,720
circulating the smoke right like good

316
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,040
stuff no no we were we in this this

317
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,079
malestrom of smoke so anyway we became

318
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,680
great Pals it was not a great success

319
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,600
this play and it closed but Brandon and

320
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,639
I uh had had a friendship he had married

321
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,440
a girl

322
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,519

325
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,920
bengi uh and I used to go up to his

326
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:49,639
apartment on the west end I guess it was

327
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:52,839
and uh smoke pot and hash and and he he

328
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,320

musician mhm and uh and he was a good

330
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,000
musician he could sing so he was he had

331
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,560
taught himself the guitar and so he'd be

332
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,519
singing all the time and I'd sing along

333
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,160

godforsaken wilderness

352
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,519

wanted to go out to to resuscitate his

366
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,680
career in the movies and so I had uh

367
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,639
taken driving lessons when I was doing

368
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,079
the amoris flea because you can't walk

369
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,360
in Los one night I tried to walk from

370
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,720
one place to another and I practically

371
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,000
was asphyxiated SM almost carbon

372
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,000
monoxide you know and there's no

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,319
sidewalks that's the thing that gets me

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,720
one of my favorite lines from La story

375
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:05,880
like I watched that as a New Yorker and

376
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,679
thought it was funny and then I moved

377
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,959
out here and I realized it was Art and

378
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,120
it's just one of my favorite things he

379
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,640
picks her up and drives three houses and

380
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,120
then stops she goes well that's it

381
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,079
couldn't we have walked and

382
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,120
then are you

383
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:27,160
crazy you move Los Angeles around the

384
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,480
letters and it spells legs on sale or

385
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,440
sale on legs for that matter as opposed

386
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,799
to Manhattan Woody Allen's movie

387
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,240
Manhattan where he runs to her apartment

388
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,720
you come about oh man so anyway uh so

389
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,320
Brandon and I drove across

390
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,039
country uh to come out to LA and that's

391
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,320
where we met up with Peter

392
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:49,039
Fonda and that's where we got involved

393
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,880
in the Sunset Strip Riot and that's

394
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,240
where I sat on Peter bergman's face and

395
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,039
that's how the fire sign theater started

396
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,720
all right

397
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,960
so uh we he were basically just doing

398
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,840
radio kpfk and again I'm going to call

399
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,440
upon uh uh Taylor to help me with this

400
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,480
uh and we became

401
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,400
successful uh the fire sign theater

402
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:22,080
became a very successful part of Peter's

403
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:24,159
radio Frias show and uh he did the first

404
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,679
lovein during that

405
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,080
time and I played a Russian character

406
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:32,120
called yavas luu which means I love you

407
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Russian Uh Russian poet and was part of

408
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:40,480
all that Madness and uh

409
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,280
we I think we we we improvised together

410
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,240
at

411
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:49,679
UCLA in in the Student Union doing uh

412
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,640
this uh a crude early version of waiting

413
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,559
for the electrician yeah improv might be

414
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,520
right what I've got the earliest like

415
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,480
fire sign flyer that I've got is from

416
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,000
April of 67 and it's it's Peter Bergman

417
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,400
and the Oz fire sign theater no no no no

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,960
no it was not advertised as Oz fire fire

419
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,240
sign theater it was the Bulgarian yeah

420
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Bulgarian players players in Exile in

421
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,320
Exile yeah but it was Bergman plus plus

422
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,480
yeah so that's how they were marketing

423
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,679
it everything that we did on the radio

424
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,320
at that time was as Anonymous as

425
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:26,880
possible okay because we we all now all

426
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,760
who are we uh Phil Austin uh David Osman

427
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,360
Peter The Wizard of Oz and myself uh all

428
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,799
met at uh kpfk realized we were all fire

429
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,600
signs which was bizarre and uh and and

430
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,039
found that we had a knack for

431
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,960
improvising together and playing

432
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,080
different characters this radio was

433
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,240
perfect so the

434
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,080
anonymity of it was more important than

435
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,240
the identity as the Oz fire sign theater

436
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,000
or you know an ensemble of players sure

437
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,440
so uh that that was part of that

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,520
mystique and or mistake if you will and

439
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,559
and so the Bulgarian uh improvisational

440
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,120
theater in Exile whatever it was

441
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:13,559
performed uh appeared with Bergman who

442
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,039
was the the draw and we

443
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,760
improvised uh a a play called waiting

444
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,760
for the electrician or someone like him

445
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,000
most of which was in mime because of

446
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,520
course we're bulgarians we don't speak

447
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,880
English to good and uh and then after

448
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,960
that no here we go now I have to figure

449
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,120
this out well like in April you've moved

450
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,880
to krla by then yeah I that's right we

451
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,520
moved to a commercial station AM station

452
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,799
yeah and were we doing the magic

453
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,480
mushroom at that no that's not until you

454
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,360
didn't do it live from the mushroom

455
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,880
until September so you're still in a

456
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,200
studio like somewhere in Pasadena until

457
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,559
September still pretty Anonymous nobody

458
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,799
knows your faces yeah except the people

459
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,000
who come to see us perform live cuz we

460
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,799
did at the magic mushroom no no this is

461
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,039
before the magic mushroom yeah yeah

462
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:10,960
nobody really knew who we were uh and

463
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:13,480
did we get a uh did we get the offer to

464
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,240
do our first album before we did the

465
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,840
magic mushroom well this is the part

466
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,799
where Austin drops from his uh from his

467
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,799
Cloud into the room and corrects us all

468
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,200
and says no no fire sign was mean

469
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,279
bergman's idea apparently he went with

470
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,720
Bergman to a dinner with Gary as

471
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:35,279
and Gary wanted something okay Gary user

472
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,240
was a producer at Columbia and Phil

473
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,520
Austin had worked with him in the

474
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,799
astrological album right and didn't he

475
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,760
do a comedy album called Duckman or

476
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,880
something yeah the single Duckman single

477
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,600
duck man so Usher was tangentially

478
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,240
through

479
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,880
Austin uh uh connected to Bergman and

480
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,480
they had a dinner and he wanted Peter to

481
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,799
do an a radio fre album okay and Bergman

482
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,279
said oh no no no we're going to do the

483
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,640
Oz fire sign theater album okay and

484
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:08,919
Usher said

485
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,480
okay which was The Fall of the House of

486
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:17,159
Usher and and so we a a deal was

487
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,159
percolating now I guess I know I went

488
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,440
back to New York so I think that what I

489
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,400
decided was my career is now going to be

490
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,720
out here yeah and uh I had become

491
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,159
estranged from uh uh uh uh Brandon

492
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,480
because Brandon was a uh there's a name

493
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,720
for somebody who smokes pole a Viper he

494
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,159
was a Viper he really loved to smoke

495
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,720
people under the table and to me that is

496
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,400
never the that was never the purpose of

497
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,279
of smoking pot yeah or hash because then

498
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,200
you you can control your hive yeah you

499
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:58,960
know uh is is that the point of any drug

500
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,679
to win I know same with alcohol

501
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
same with alcohol you know you drink so

502
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,400
you're happy and I mean then you switch

503
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
to soda water or something yeah when it

504
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,440
turns into a unless you're an alcoholic

505
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,240
or a Viper you know which case it's like

506
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,039
I can get higher than you can you know

507
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,919
yes and and and it's fine because

508
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,200
Brandon was a Sweet Soul and a wonderful

509
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,360
person and bright and funny and and

510
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,760
happy but but I would become dull and

511
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,720
and dazed you know and it wasn't fun

512
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,440
anymore and so we we kind of drifted

513
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,039
away does the idea of getting the album

514
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,679
or the album coming up is that what

515
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,000
feels like the career is about to happen

516
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,000
here's what happened that's my question

517
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,400
this is what happened I ended up living

518
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,240
with Diana du and and we had a a lovely

519
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:52,000
Affair together and at a certain

520
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:55,200
point I knew that it was over and that I

521
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,120
had to go on with the rest of my life

522
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,400
and at that very moment when we're

523
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,159
having this conversation the phone rings

524
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,720
it's for me it's Peter Bergman and he

525
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:11,520
says Phil there's a first class ticket

526
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,559
waiting for you down at Black Rock which

527
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,799
was Rockefeller Plaza CBS building

528
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,720
whatever uh we want we need you to fly

529
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,720
out because we're going to write and

530
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,520
produce our first record and all we have

531
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,880
is the title waiting for the electrician

532
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,120
or someone like

533
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,200
him I said

534
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:37,159
okay off I went yeah and uh and I I was

535
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,799
living then in Peter's house he had a

536
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:44,000
house in Laurel Canyon and David and his

537
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:48,440

538
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,440
too the house had like an

539
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:55,559

729
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:08,960
control it I was in like this little

730
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:12,760
safety zone working with these great

731
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,440
guys and now we'll get back to Colombia

732
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,960
and we're working in these classic

733
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,879
Studios with Engineers who are basically

734
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,919
uh state-of-the-art Engineers for the

735
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:27,560
time and one of the the jokes that uh

736
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,119
one of well I should say jokes one of

737
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,520
the the funny things that happened was

738
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,159
when we were recording this album

739
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,280
MH we we we we went out for a break in

740
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:43,520
the Columbia building and they were

741
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:47,200
taking out old sound effects uh uh props

742
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:51,000
to throw away no no no no God marching

743
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,879
men wind machines little

744
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,480
doors we're going to throw them away and

745
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:00,760
we said no no had we we need these

746
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,280
and that's when I started my career as

747
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,200
Darth Foley you know how much how much

748
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,320
of this did you get away with what the

749
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,680
stuff yeah oh we they gave us

750
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,320
everything throw it away and the door

751
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,160
that we had ended up with Stan freeberg

752
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,160
really because of Fred Jones this ZIP

753
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:23,119
into the future here so

754
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,760
anyway this album uh we we didn't have

755
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,160
we didn't have the contract that we got

756
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,000
later because of a fellow named John

757
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,680
McClure I'll talk about about that but

758
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,240
at this album we were just you know like

759
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:41,359
spoken art actors doing something

760
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:44,119
different yeah uh with comedy but nobody

761
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,040
had done anything like this and we

762
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,800
hadn't really ever done anything like

763
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,680
this right because we weren't doing the

764
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:55,839
magic mushroom but we all knew when we

765
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:59,640
wrote the album that we were going to do

766
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,920
a radio show that unlike anything that

767
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,960
had been done before we're going to do a

768
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,119
soundscape and and we were going to and

769
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,200
we and and we could design it any way we

770
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,599
wanted and of course so there's the one

771
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,240
long story waiting for the electrician

772
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,560
right and then there's the story the

773
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,079
three little pieces on the other

774
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,880
side not that we designed it that way it

775
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,800
just was organic and it happened that

776
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,160
way yeah we were writing about the

777
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,599
topics that were uh in the culture at

778
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,200
the moment that we were a part of that

779
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,920
interested us and that we could parody

780
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,720
yeah cuz we that's what we were doing on

781
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,920
the radio we were parodying we were

782
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,839
insiders slightly parodying the the very

783
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,680
culture that we wanted to be a part of

784
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,839
you know and wasn't there kind of a

785
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,720
pressure overweening everybody you have

786
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,319
to have more than one cut on one side

787
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,880
you can't have oh yeah all of the

788
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:53,520
designs all of the design remember we we

789
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,040
were revolutionary in the sense that we

790
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,839
wanted to create like a story on one

791
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,200
side no you can't do that you know you

792
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,280
have to have little

793
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,280
things because basically you know uh uh

794
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,720
other other than certain isolated story

795
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,240
albums like the the crepitation contest

796
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,960
and things like that which came from

797
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,960
Canada right uh or the bozo records or

798
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,839
you know Adventures for kids and stuff

799
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,599
like that for the most part comedy

800
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,319
records were recorded routines right the

801
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,520
best of the recorded routines uh and and

802
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:28,440
they'd last as long as they lasted you

803
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,079
know cut cut cut cut cut and and they

804
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,400
were designed to be played on the radio

805
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,440
if they could and all that stuff fine

806
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,160
but that's not what we wanted to do and

807
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,440
uh uh and and luckily because we had

808
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,240
this understanding management company

809
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,680
behind us Jimmy guio and Larry

810
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,599
Fitzgerald uh they volunteered it was

811
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,800
almost

812
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,520
magical the there was a day they were

813
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,319
working with an orchestra for something

814
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,400
for Chicago I don't know what it wasn't

815
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:02,280
Chicago but an orchest

816
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:06,640
at columia and they brought us in and

817
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:09,480
they they orchestrated and and played

818
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,960
recorded some pieces for this album

819
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,200
Amazing you know the D the traffic thing

820
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,920
they recorded these Transitions and all

821
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,079
yeah all this crazy stuff where did that

822
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,119
how did that happen where did it come

823
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:25,160
from I don't know because we were all we

824
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,680
were just like part of this of this

825
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,920
magic we were we were in the in the

826
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,160
stream of this event that was happening

827
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,960
I think

828
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,760
Jimmy

829
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:41,280
understood what we were trying to do so

830
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,160
did Gary Usher and they liked it and

831
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,480
they said this is this could go

832
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,240
somewhere this is interesting this is

833
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,599
like they're a band you know they're

834
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,720
they're making comedy music they're a

835
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:56,640
band and and they brought their

836
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,200
expertise to that and supported us in in

837
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,599
ways that absolutely totally surprised

838
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,040
me yeah I didn't and yet at the same

839
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,880
time it it was expected it was kind of

840
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,200
like muh yeah yeah you know this is what

841
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,319
we want to do and we're doing it and and

842
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,680
they're helping us so it must be right

843
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:18,000
right there were no barriers to what we

844
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,400
were doing did you do was it sort of

845
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,200
like was there ever we're just going to

846
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,119
do this or did you ever say can this be

847
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,839
done or you just assumed we never said

848
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,560
done it was it was we were we're going

849
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:33,800
to do radio on record yeah and we're

850
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,599
going to make it interesting enough that

851
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,160
you'll be able to listen to it a lot of

852
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,440
times you can listen to it again and

853
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,040
again and again it's not going to get

854
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,000
tired you know uh and and of course one

855
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,040
of the predictive things about this

856
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,119
album and this title which Bergman

857
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,359
basically had come up with because he

858
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,760
had an experience in Amsterdam when he

859
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,960
was researching

860
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,280
LSD uh and and

861
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,760
psychedelics uh with the fool which is a

862
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,640
group of performance artists and

863
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,800
musicians who later Allied themselves

864
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,880
with the Beatles had had that one elet

865
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,119
and did a lot of artwork for the Beatles

866
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,359
yeah uh painting their limousines and

867
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,920
things like that uh he was up on a roof

868
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:22,839
smoking something and uh there was a

869
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,359
blackout in the city and that's where

870
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,760
the idea of waiting for the electrician

871
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,440
or someone like him to get things going

872
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,640
again huh became a part of you know he

873
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,680
tells the story on one of these on one

874
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:38,200
of these um radio freeas in the fall of

875
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,760
67 and it's like he tell he says that

876
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,599
first line out loud we're all just

877
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,119
waiting for the electrician and somebody

878
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,720
but I can't remember his name next to

879
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,599
him or someone someone like him yeah so

880
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,200
it wasn't even all his his initial but

881
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:55,720
what's what's so startling about this

882
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:58,680
is that main story is about an Eastern

883
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:03,200
European country mhm that is in the

884
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:07,119
midst of a revolution yeah okay

885
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,839
and that really happened first in Poland

886
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,040
and

887
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:15,400
leesa was one of the main uh forces in

888
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,599
that Revolution and you know what his

889
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,119
job

890
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:23,240
was he was a ship's

891
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:26,160
electrician it's amazing oh yeah there's

892
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,440
a lot of amazing stuff that that has

893
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,800
happened like that so my memories of

894
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:36,640
actually making the album were pure fun

895
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,920
yeah and uh the recording sessions David

896
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,640
actually did I think both David and I

897
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,160
took movies right of the of the early

898
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,000
session was that where that happened I

899
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:51,640
haven't got any home M well well anyway

900
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:55,079
it was it was easy and fun to do it and

901
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:59,240
and then we had the great pleasure

902
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:01,520
because we were producing it mhm uh you

903
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,520
know I mean we were the creative

904
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,760
producers sure Hands-On producers we got

905
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,359
to mix it I was that was my next

906
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,640
question actually okay and that for me

907
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,720
was a complete Revelation now when I was

908
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,960
at Yale from uh

909
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,680
58 59 to 62 something like that my

910
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,480
scholarship job was editing a program

911
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,440
called Yale reports uhuh and that's

912
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,079
where I learned tape editing ah and what

913
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,480
I did as he well knows was that uh they

914
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,800
had all these famous people Henry

915
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,760
Kissinger and Poets and writers and

916
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,960
critics and know all being interviewed

917
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,960
for this this half hour radio show and I

918
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,960
had to cut it down to 27 minutes or

919
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,359
something like that so I would take out

920
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:51,160
their uh Speech impediments the you know

921
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:53,920
their their Habits Like s and us and

922
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,559
butts and pauses and repetitions my God

923
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,520
and to to get it down to time after out

924
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:01,599
certain phrases and things that had

925
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,079
already been highlighted to be removed

926
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,960
wow uh and I kept them

927
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:13,240
all oh no and so at the at the end of my

928
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,520
semester i i i i i over the course of

929
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,680
the semester I edited I've been editing

930
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,800
them together on a real and I and the

931
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,880
ultimate result is called Yale distorts

932
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,079
and it's on one of our albums it's it it

933
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,119
ended up being you opened one of the

934
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,760
dear friend shows with and it goes

935
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,400
things like you'll hear you know the

936
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,079
hostess says so Mr Kissinger how did you

937
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,680
feel at that exact moment when you had

938
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,920
to make the decision well you know that

939
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:43,599
the it was it it was a and and the uh

940
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,359
but but the the well you know let me try

941
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,240
to say if I could and and you know it I

942
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:53,000
don't but uh so and

943
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,960
that and so it's made up of all those

944
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,920
wonderful rhythmical it's the way

945
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,359
politicians actually speak now and and

946
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,680
also what's so interesting is some of

947
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,520
them there's this guy with their French

948
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,640
accent where I got my old French accent

949
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,520
from he was a teacher of mine he used to

950
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,359
do things like yes but but but you know

951
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:13,200
but but but but so you know there each

952
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:15,319
one of them had a different kind of an

953
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,440
of a speech pattern yeah it is

954
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:22,640
absolutely a classic early tape I mean

955
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:26,160
it's it's cult it's culture jamming from

956
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,559
from the' 60s and it's themed it tells

957
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,319
us

958
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,480
it tells the story it starts to go off

959
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:33,760
on the sex tangent yeah I edited it

960
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,280
together oh yeah and oh no we should cut

961
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,000
that out you know like that I should I

962
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,599
have to listen to it again I have the

963
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,040
original tape somewhere but of course it

964
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,559
probably break to pieces if I unless I

965
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:51,640
bake it you know uh so uh uh we we did

966
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:55,000
this album MH and we went we mixed it

967
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,720
and the mixing was four guys at sitting

968
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
at the the the mixing board uhhuh

969
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,960
you know our our engineer would help us

970
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,160
now remember at that time we had how

971
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,040
many tracks

972
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,480
107 you have four oh really four [ __ ]

973
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,160
think of that it was four than eight 16

974
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,800
and we were pioneering

975
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,839
multi-layered tracking right so what

976
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,079
would happen is we'd fill up our four

977
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:25,160
tracks and then our brilliant Engineers

978
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:29,720
one of whom was named

979
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,680
Dremel drel Dr ml dribble uh would would

980
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,839
what they call pingpong they take the

981
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,359
two tracks two of the tracks that we

982
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:40,359
done sure put them on the other tracks

983
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,040
somehow and clear the two tracks so we

984
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:44,920
can put more stuff on okay yeah yeah

985
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:49,200
okay that's brilliant and yeah it was

986
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:51,240
and it allowed us to to uh uh realize

987
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,160
our audio

988
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:59,000
Vision if you

989
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,720
will and uh uh and uh uh evolve it

990
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,559
during the you know during the course of

991
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,559
of our mix and everything later of

992
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:07,839
course

993
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,839
they the tapes became much more they had

994
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,240
more tracks on them 12 track tape for

995
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:15,440
instance and made it easy for us and

996
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,160
then I remember was so funny to me the

997
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,440
the reels got bigger and bigger and

998
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,160
bigger till there like a hundred tracks

999
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,000
and the reels were big the tape was like

1000
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,960
you know like a

1001
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,240
lasagna no no more little thin things

1002
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:34,040
big things to take and you had to take a

1003
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:37,760
machete to cut it you know and and and

1004
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,680
then it all went away it became digital

1005
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,640
everything went away it's like it got so

1006
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,480
big and we were getting smaller in

1007
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,720
relation and then suddenly we were all

1008
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,839
small yeah everything was small uh but

1009
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:55,400
but during that time the the pleasure of

1010
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,760
being able to mix things in to take a

1011
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,520
track that we laid in which was you know

1012
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,119
like an A A Walla track a background

1013
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,040
track where we all could not help us we

1014
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:06,839
always saying funny things right do you

1015
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,200
like

1016
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,720
horses I have one I don't mean to cut

1017
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,920
you off but there's one thing that stood

1018
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,960
out to me and it's the craziest it might

1019
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,880
be the longest piece of backward masking

1020
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,240
in an album ever yeah in the airport is

1021
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,079
it the airport or train station my

1022
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,720
brain's not working right now what is it

1023
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,040
the election the electrician piece the

1024
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,319
first like four minutes of that where

1025
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,720
it's you you think you hear the

1026
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,280
background of airport yeah that's what

1027
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,000
it sounds like but it's backward masking

1028
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,680
the entire time yeah you know what's

1029
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,839
happening there that's taken de directly

1030
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,920
from one with the Andre jman uh sound

1031
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,520
effects records from like

1032
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,920
6263 what happened in that original

1033
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,119
album which they L later recycled

1034
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,880
endlessly and dear friends they had

1035
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:51,400
somebody page

1036
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,680
Andre you can't hear it on the fire sign

1037
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,160
album because they they like Mosaic it

1038
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,480
out somehow okay yeah so every time they

1039
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,760
say his name

1040
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,960
it's is that what I'm hearing that's

1041
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,280
what they were doing at that point [ __ ]

1042
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,280
yeah well see that's which is Goofy I I

1043
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,720
really I really should have listened to

1044
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:15,160
the album before I came in but my but my

1045
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:17,400
life is so full of of stuff that's

1046
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,640
happening now of course it's really hard

1047
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,040
to go forward into the past right that's

1048
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:25,200
why we're here to do

1049
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,240
things I apologize that hard drive that

1050
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,880
is what you missed earlier was the two

1051
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,520
qu back and theyve only recently met but

1052
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:38,240
this is IPA and fire sign of

1053
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,640
the the fire sign theater created a um

1054
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,800
an opportunity for people to coales and

1055
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:47,160
to you know to to meet one another on an

1056
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,200
interesting intellectual and emotional

1057
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:54,640
comedic level uh to this day it happens

1058
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,680
I did a play reading uh uh a couple of

1059
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,760
days ago and one of the

1060
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,680
uh people who was there is the head of a

1061
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,400
local Jewish theater this is this is a

1062
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:09,440
play in which I play David Irving MH a

1063
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,400
holocaust denier ahu and and all

1064
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,200
everything I say in this play he's an

1065
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,319
Englishman is in his own words from his

1066
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,280
books and his lectures okay it's

1067
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,400
extraordinary and he absolutely is a

1068
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,000
Believer he absolutely believes in what

1069
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,640
he's an historian he wrot of these books

1070
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,400
and he basically says that AST is a

1071
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,480
fraud you know and he proves it's

1072
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,359
impossible to burn that many bodies and

1073
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,839
you know where the piles of coke that

1074
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:37,079
they needed to to fuel the fires and

1075
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,480
anyway so I did did this this wonderful

1076
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,480
interesting Play It's called stubborn

1077
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,240
things and trying to get a production of

1078
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,480
it in town which I think they should and

1079
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,440
by the way there's a movie coming out

1080
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,520
about David

1081
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,280
Irving which I know only a little bit

1082
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,760
about but so this this because the

1083
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:57,599
reason is that he

1084
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:01,000
was publicly um humiliated in a court

1085
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:07,400
case uhhuh because David Irving has such

1086
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:09,400
an immense ego that he was he uh sued a

1087
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,599
guy who wrote a book saying that he was

1088
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,680

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:24,079
today concerning eco-friendly gun rights

1202
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:28,720
right and that's biodegradable Weaponry

1203
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:31,920
the government uses uh a lot of plastics

1204
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,839
chemicals oils and we really need to

1205
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,960
refocus our efforts towards things that

1206
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:37,720
are more

1207
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,160

1212
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:59,960
